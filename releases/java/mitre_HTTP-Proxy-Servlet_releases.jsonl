It requires though, that compression filters in the servlet container\r\nrespect already set `Content-Encoding` headers and don't try to compress the\r\noutputstream again. The old behaviour can be restored by setting the init\r\nparameter `handleCompression` to `true`.\r\nThanks Matthias Bl\u00e4sing\r\n\r\n\\#187: URITemplateProxyServlet should have been URL encoding the template parameter names.\r\nThanks Daniel Hasler\r\n\r\n\\#190: Percent encoded question marks in the path should stay encoded."}
