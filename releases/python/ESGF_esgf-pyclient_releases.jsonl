The tests have been updated and various fixes made to make them match the up-to-date ESGF Search API.\n2. Following problems with the search being slow in certain scenarios an extra call to the Search service was made optional through the SearchContext.search() method. If you send the argument and value of ignore_facet_check=True then this hidden call to the service will be avoided. This typically saves 2 seconds of wait time which can be very important in some iterative search scenarios.\n3. The SearchContext.search() method was also extended so that the argument batch_size could be directly sent to it in order to manage how the calls to the API would be separated out into batches. This does not affect the final result but may affect the speed of the response. The batch size can also be set as a default in the pyesgf.search.consts module.\n4. Searches at the file-level now return a gridftp_url property along with other existing properties such as download_url.\n"}
