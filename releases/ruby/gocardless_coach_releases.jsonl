This better allows instrumentation tools to plugin to Coach.\r\n\r\nMinor bump rather than patch because if a user is simply subscribing, then they may see the `coach.handler.finish` event fire twice (once at the start, with no instrumentation values, once at the end with duration etc). In most cases this won't cause issues, as the argument values will still be the same."}
