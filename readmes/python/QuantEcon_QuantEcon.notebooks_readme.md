QuantEcon Notebooks
===================

This repository collects notebooks related to `QuantEcon <http://quantecon.org>`__ projects.  

A curated list of notebooks that draws on the notebooks collected
in this repository is now available `here <http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html>`__

You can run these notebooks live using the mybinder service

Please add your notebooks by push or PR.  When doing so, please add your
notebook to the top level of this repo (no need to put it in a subdirectory)
and give it a unique and reasonably descriptive name.

Any notebooks that require dependencies to run should locate these in the ``dependencies`` folder.

There is a simple `fetch utility <http://quanteconpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/util/notebooks.html>`__ built into the python ``quantecon`` package.
