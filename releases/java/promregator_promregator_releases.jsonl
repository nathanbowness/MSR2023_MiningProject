Various infrastructure components had to be upgraded as well (e.g. upgrade to Ubuntu docker image 20.04). Root cause of it was that SonarQube has announced dropping support for JDK8-based build environments starting February 2021. \r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\nnone \r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package for download (see attached)\r\n2. via jar-binary package available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.promregator) (via the [OSSRH](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) process, primary host is [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~com.github.promregator), further OSS Maven mirrors will follow automatically over time)\r\n3. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/\r\n\r\nYou may verify the consistency of your download using the hash values/checksums provided in the attached file ending with \".hashsums\".

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\nnone\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Adding a new configuration option `cf.watchdog.timeout` which permits changing the Cloud Foundry Watchdog timeout. \r\n* Adding new configuration options `cf.watchdog.rate` and `cf.watchdog.initialDelay` which permits changing the Cloud Foundry Watchdog frequency and initial delay.\r\n* Adding a new configuration option `cf.watchdog.restartCount` which permits providing an upper number of attempts to reconnect to Cloud Foundry Controller before Promregator tries to restart itself.\r\n* Performance improvement in case of large numbers of orgs/spaces/applications especially when performing initial discovery (see also issue [#157](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/157)). Kudos go to @checketts.\r\n* The logging message \"Application id could not be found for org 'x', space 'y' and application 'z'. Check your configuration; skipping it for now\" could be raised such often that it caused log flooding. The message has been adapted and moved to be emitted from a dedicated own Logger such that it can be muted by setting `logging.org.cloudfoundry.promregator.scanner.ReactiveTargetResolver.EmptyTarget` to `ERROR` or higher (see also [issue #164](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/164)).\r\n* The configuration option `cf.request.rateLimit` permits throttling Promregator when sending requests to the Cloud Foundry platform. This may help to adapt the load Promregator generates on weak Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller. See also [issue #171](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/171).\r\n* To ensure that a failing Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller is able to recover better and does not get flooded after returning erroneous responses, Promregator now supports \"backing off\": It will wait a certain amount of time before querying again. Additionally, the amount of time is randomized within certain limits. The \"backing off interval\" can be configured via `cf.request.backoff`. See also [issue #171](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/171) and [pull request #174](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/174).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixing the case that the configuration option `cf.watchdog` did not work properly. To make it working together with `cf.watchdog.timeout`, the non-working configuration option `cf.watchdog` was renamed to `cf.watchdog.enabled`.\r\n* There were [known direct memory leaks in cf-java-client 3.17.1.RELEASE and earlier](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/issues/903). Code reading of the correction indicate cases where also Promregator might be affected. The symptom would most likely comprise of \"OutOfMemory\" situations. A final verification was not possible though (see also [issue #155](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/155)).\r\n* Includes an upgraded version of the underlying [Cloud Foundry Client library](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client). This solves a memory leak of the direct memory pool, which only surfaced on expiry of the CF tokens (see also [cf-java-client#1029](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/pull/1029)). Promregator is also affected by this. Kudos go to @checketts and @warlockza. \r\n* On connection resets it may have happened that the previous connection pool (open connections and associated threads) have been leaked. This could have led to a resource leak. The resources are released explicitly now (see also [issue #161](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/161)).\r\n* The docker images created for 0.7.3 and 0.7.4 had installed a mixture of OpenJDK8 and OpenJDK11. This leads to a failure on startup when using usual start parameters (see also [issue #169](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/169)).\r\n* Specifying a target which did not have a fully-specified `orgName` while having enabled the new Caffeine Cache led to `NullPointerException`s (see also [pull request #172](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/172)).\r\n* Applications which have malformed metric documents may cause the scraping to fail with a NullPointerException. The coding has been made more robust to handle this (see also [pull request #175](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/175)).\r\n* Patches of dependent libraries provided due to possible security concerns (Note: This is was done as preventive measure. There is no vulnerability known as of writing) (see also [issue #179](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/179) and [issue #183](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/183))\r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package for download (see attached)\r\n2. via jar-binary package available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.promregator) (via the [OSSRH](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) process, primary host is [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~com.github.promregator), further OSS Maven mirrors will follow automatically over time)\r\n3. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/\r\n\r\nYou may verify the consistency of your download using the hash values/checksums provided in the attached file ending with \".hashsums\".

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\nnone\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Added support for JSON-formatted logging (see also [#120](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/120))\r\n* Separation of proxy configuration between API host (CFCC) and application containers, deprecating `cf.proxyHost` and `cf.proxyPort`. The two options still work in a compatible manner, but shall not be used anymore. Use `cf.proxy.host`, `cf.proxy.port`, `promregator.scraping.proxy.host` and `promregator.scraping.proxy.port` instead (see also [#128](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/128))\r\n* A new type of cache is made available: the Caffeine cache. The new cache supports requesting an update of data while still keeping the old version of the data available to consumers. This should help significantly with Cloud Foundry Cloud Controllers, which have high latency or jitter. By default, the old cache type still is used. For more details see also configuration option `cf.cache.type` and the [Cache Type's page](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/blob/8fa9cf12441cc5d5fd21d76d56d26d39abf58e87/docs/cache-types.md) (see also [#116](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/116)).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Due to [a bug in Tomcat 9.0.22](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=63570), target IP addresses/hostnames of the discovery response could return the address of the caller instead of the Promregator server (see also [#119](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/119)).\r\n* [Pull Request 125](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/125) / [Issue 126](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/126) gave reason that Promregator might be vulnerable to a denial of service attack based on manipulated file names on compressed artifacts (CVE-2019-12402), as it transitively uses `org.apache.commons:commons-compress`. As of writing there are no known attacks on this and no place is known where the vulnerability could be exploited. Yet, to eliminate any risk, the affected libraries have been updated to a version where a security fix (provided by the library authors) is available.\r\n* Additional sanitation is introduced for JSON responses provided by the OAuth authentication server in case of using OAuth2XSUAA credentials for scraping ([#126](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/126)).\r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package for download (see attached)\r\n2. via jar-binary package available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.promregator) (via the [OSSRH](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) process, primary host is [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~com.github.promregator), further OSS Maven mirrors will follow automatically over time)\r\n3. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/\r\n\r\nYou may verify the consistency of your download using the hash values/checksums provided in the attached file ending with \".hashsums\".

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\n* The default number of Tomcat worker threads was reduced from 200 to 16. Too high numbers may render Promregator unresponsive and may lead to Out of Memory situations. If you have a high-load environment, you have to check the maximal number of threads which you require (if in Single Target Scraping mode, usually equivalent to the number of concurrent connections to Promregator) and adjust the configuration parameter `server.tomcat.max-threads` accordingly (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Introduction of `cf.connectionPool.size` and `cf.threadPool.size`, which permits to configure the connection handling and I/O thread pool size in high-load environments. For details on these options refer to the configuration page (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n* Also the determination of application identifiers of applications in spaces is cached now. The high number of requests caused major latency to be introduced for several processes (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n* Support for encrypted passwords in spring configuration including support for setting the encryption key using Docker Secrets (see [issue #62](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/62) and [issue #88](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/88)).\r\n* To be able to deploy to Maven Central, the groupId of Promregator was changed from `org.cloudfoundry` to `com.github.promregator` (see [issue #104](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/104)).\r\n* The disk space footprint of the Docker image got reduced by a rearranged build process (see [issue #106](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/106)).\r\n* Spring Boot version has been updated to the 2.1.x series to fix possible known vulnerabilities (though we are not aware of anything concrete) (see [issue #108](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/108))\r\n* JVM Hotspot Metrics library for Promregator simpleclient library has been updated to the most recent version.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Major flaw in caching system, which may have caused that redundant calls have been sent to the Cloud Controller, practically making almost all cache request behave like cache misses (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n* In case an application Id could not be resolved (e.g. because the application name was misspelled), an ugly error message was logged and discovery was partially broken. Instead a proper warning message is now shown (see [issue #86](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/86)) \r\n* Only the first 50 applications had been considered in case `applicationRegex` was used in the target configuration. The same might also have happened for spaces and organizations (though that has not been reported so far) (see [issue #85](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/85)) \r\n* Fixes a situation Single Target Scraping mode, which could lead to a NullPointerException (see [issue #82](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/82))\r\n* Most recent version of Spring Boot and Reactor Netty is being used, hoping that it will resolve a connection issue (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83))\r\n* An application with health check type \"none\" could cause a discovery error. The issue had its root cause in the cf-java-client library. The newer version has been included (see [issue #72](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/72)).\r\n* Implementing a Cloud Foundry Client watchdog, which should detect a broken connection to the Cloud Controller and try to re-establish the connection (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n* The fetcher thread pool could suffer from resource starvation in case targets did not properly complete and/or close connections. This could go so far that no scraping was possible anymore. The two new configuration options `promregator.scraping.connectionTimeout` and `promregator.scraping.socketReadTimeout` have been introduced to set appropriate timeouts. They become enabled by default (see also [issue #94](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/94)).\r\n* Erroneous cache entries have been kept in the cache for too long. This especially may be harmful, If the cache timeouts are set to high values, such as for the org cache (see also [issue #96](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/96)).\r\n* The locking of cache entries on initial load situations had been done with non-unique lock objects. This may have lead to superfluous requests bypassing the cache. The behavior may be seen at the space or application caches only; the org cache was not affected (see also [issue #100](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/100)).\r\n* The warning message, which is raised in case that two instance targets provide conflicting metric types, has been improved textually (see also [issue #104](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/104)).\r\n* Having entered invalid names for `orgName` or `spaceName` has lead to an `IndexOfOutBoundsException`. The exception were not harmful, but have been removed. (see also [issue #109](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/109)).\r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package for download (see attached)\r\n2. via jar-binary package available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.github.promregator) (via the [OSSRH](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) process, primary host is [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~com.github.promregator), further OSS Maven mirrors will follow automatically over time)\r\n3. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/\r\n\r\nYou may verify the consistency of your download using the hash values/checksums provided in the attached file ending with \".hashsums\".

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\n* The default number of Tomcat worker threads was reduced from 200 to 16. Too high numbers may render Promregator unresponsive and may lead to Out of Memory situations. If you have a high-load environment, you have to check the maximal number of threads which you require (if in Single Target Scraping mode, usually equivalent to the number of concurrent connections to Promregator) and adjust the configuration parameter `server.tomcat.max-threads` accordingly (see [issue #83](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/83)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Also the determination of application identifiers of applications in spaces is cached now.

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\n* The configuration options `cf.request.timeout.routeMapping`, `cf.request.timeout.route`, `cf.request.timeout.sharedDomain`, `cf.request.timeout.process` became obsolete. If you used one of them, you have to check the impact on your scraping. Consider to use option `cf.request.timeout.appSummary` instead. For details refer to the configuration options documentation. \r\n\r\n   Reason for this change is caused by necessary double maintenance of [issue #67](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/67).\r\n* The configuration options `promregator.endpoint.threads` and `promregator.endpoint.maxProcessingTime` have been deprecated in favor of `promregator.scraping.threads` and `promregator.scraping.maxProcessingTime` respectively. If you have sent one of them, you will receive a warning in the logs, which requests you to change the name in your configuration. \r\n\r\n   Reason for this change is caused by a possible misunderstanding of the meaning of the option (see also [issue #70](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/70)).\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Support for regular expressions to be used not just on the name of applications, but also on spaces and organizations (see also [issue #35](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/35)).\r\n* Support for private domains; also improves performance of discovery (see also [issue #64](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/64))\r\n* It is possible to disable label enrichment for metrics scraped. This allows to use label rewriting in Prometheus and thus having one's own set of custom labeling rules (see also [issue prometheus/docs#76](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/1190)). When to use which variant in which mode is described at [Using relabel_configs with promregator.scraping.labelEnrichment](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/wiki/Using-relabel_configs-with-promregator.scraping.labelEnrichment).\r\n\r\n  Users upgrading might want to read [Rewriting Rule For __metrics_path__ No Longer Required for Promregator 0.5.0 and Later](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/wiki/Rewriting-Rule-For-__metrics_path__-No-Longer-Required-for-Promregator-0.5.0-and-Later).\r\n* The error message in case of timeouts during the discovery phase has been improved (see also [issue #67](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/67))\r\n* Cache handing of Cloud Foundry requests has been refactored significantly. Configuration options `cf.cache.expiry.*` have been added (see also [issue #67](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/67))\r\n* `cf.target[].applicationRegex` had been case-sensitive before. To be consistent with the behavior of Cloud Foundry, this has been changed to case-insensitive. (see also [issue #76](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/76)).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Improving error handling in case of invalid responses by the CF Cloud Controller or if the answer on metadata does not contain values as expected (see also [issue #65](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/65))\r\n* Metrics received, which do not have any `# HELP` line, may cause a NullPointerException; fixed by adding an empty help string (see also [issue #73](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/73))\r\n* Multiple target configurations, which get resolved and then have discovered the same application multiple times (e.g. by applicationRegex) could have lead to multiple discovery and multiple scraping of the target.

With this release the following changes are provided:\r\n\r\n## Must-Know Information\r\nnone\r\n\r\n## Good-To-Know Information / New Features\r\n* Specifying the name of the application now is considered an optional parameter. By this you are able to select \"all applications\" within a give org/space for scraping (see also PR [#53](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/53)).\r\n* Applications within a space may be selected based on a regular expression of the applications name (first part of feature request at [#35](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/35))\r\n* Caches can now be invalidated by sending HTTP requests to an endpoint. The endpoint can be configured to be auth-protected (see also PR [#53](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/53)).\r\n* The configuration option `cf.cache.timeout.resolver` has been added to allow specifying how long the result of the mapping between incomplete targets (e.g. the application name was not specified and thus all applications shall be scraped) and the list of effective targets shall be considered valid (see also PR [#53](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/53)).\r\n* It is now possible to run Promregator in a High-Availability scenario as Docker container on Cloud Foundry (see also issue [#44](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/44)).\r\n* Promregator now supports providing different sets of credentials per target (see also issue [#60](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/60)).\r\n* New metric `promregator_request_size` exposed, which provides information about the size of the scraping document retrieved from targets.\r\n* Extensive logging of Single Target Scraping Requests could cause clutter and performance issues; logging levels of log messages have been adjusted (changed from INFO to DEBUG, see also issue [#57](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/57))\r\n* The metric `promregator_request_latency` is disabled by default now to prevent performance issues (memory throughput) (see also issue [#56](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/56))\r\n* The new option `promregator.reactor.debug` allows to set the reactor's framework into debugging mode to facilitate support activities (see also issue [#59](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/59))\r\n* Improved logging support on errors while retrieving data from the Cloud Foundry platform (see also issue [#59](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/59))\r\n* On a failed attempt to read data from the Cloud Foundry platform API host, automatically a second attempt is made. If the second attempt is ok, no error is indicated, thus making Promregator a little fault tolerant.\r\n* Upgrading to Spring Boot 2.0.3 (esp. propagating security patches from upstream)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixed error message by Prometheus due to `promregator_scrape_duration_seconds` not having label values, if running in Single Target Scraping mode (see issue [#52](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/52)).\r\n* Labels containing a closing curly bracket are now passed properly through Promregator (see PR [#55](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/pull/55)).\r\n* Catalina's Session Cache is disabled to avoid unnecessary memory consumption (see also issue [#54](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/54)).\r\n* Support for triggering major garbage collection periodically to prevent OutOfMemory dumps (see also issue [#54](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/54)).\r\n* If running as pre-delivered docker container, the cgroup memory limits are being used for determining the heap memory limits (-Xms and -Xmx) (see also issue [#54](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/54))\r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package (see attached)\r\n2. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/\r\n\r\nYou may verify the consistency of your download using the hash values/checksums provided in the attached file ending with \".hashsums\".

Note though, that the current mode (Single Endpoint Scraping Mode) still is the recommended one.\r\n* Promregator now supports inbound authentication using HTTP Basic Auth (issue [#17](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/17)). The configuration documentation has been adjusted accordingly. \r\n* Introduced option `cf.skipSslValidation` to allow running against Cloud Foundry API instances, which only have a self-signed certificate (one part of [issue #36](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/36)).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Limitation that `cf.proxyHost` may not have contained a hostname (but only an IP address) is fixed by a workaround (the underlying library still is broken).\r\n* Invalidly prefixing `cf.proxyHost` and/or `cf.api_host` with `https://` or `http://` is being checked and an improved error message is returned (one part of [issue #36](https://github.com/promregator/promregator/issues/36))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Delivery\r\nThis release of Promregator is delivered via the following channels:\r\n\r\n1. via jar-binary package (see attached)\r\n2. via Docker container available at https://hub.docker.com/r/promregator/promregator/"}
