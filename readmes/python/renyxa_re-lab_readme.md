Re-lab is a project that focuses on doing clean-room reverse engineering 
of various proprietary file formats, so that developers of free/libre 
software could implement support for these file formats.

We do not write end-user software, but we collaborate with projects like 
Inkscape, Scribus, and LibreOffice to make some popular proprietary file 
formats readable by those applications.

This repository contains generic tools we developed for studying binary 
file formats, as well as parsers of specific file formats. 

Please refer to README of each tool for more information.
