Like\r\n  the DLIS reader, the new LIS reader is mainly implemented in C/C++ with\r\n  python bindings on top. The reader is not feature complete at this point. But\r\n  it can read most curves, with a few exceptions (see the docs of\r\n  dlisio.lis.curves). Basic metadata such as LIS Header/trailer Records (RHLR,\r\n  RTLR, THLR, TTLR, FHLR, FTLR) can also be read. Support for more complex LIS\r\n  Records such Information Records is not yet added. The LIS reader\r\n  resides in the python submodule ``dlisio.lis``.\r\n* The python module is restructured to accommodate the new LIS reader. Most\r\n  notably, all DLIS related functionality is moved to the submodule\r\n  ``dlisio.dlis``. I.e.  this release breaks the main entry point of dlisio\r\n  ``dlisio.load`` which from this release and onwards is moved to\r\n  ``dlisio.dlis.load``. For a full overview of the restructuring see\r\n  commit ``#736d545``.\r\n* The documentation on readthedocs_ has been given an overhaul to fit the new\r\n  module structure and LIS documentation is added.\r\n* Added support for DLIS NOFORM objects.\r\n* Better debug information for broken DLIS files.\r\n* Better error message when passing a directory as path to ``dlisio.dlis.load``.\r\n* Nicer error message when failing to construct datetime objects due to invalid\r\n  dates in the file.\r\n* Added support for python 3.9\r\n* Dropped support for python 3.5\r\n* Restructuring the C/C++ core of dlisio, please refer to the git log for a\r\n  full overview of the restructuring.\r\n* The C and C++ targets are merged into one target ``dlisio``, and\r\n  ``dlisio-extension`` ceased to exist."}

It is now possible to tell dlisio which\r\n  string encodings to try if decoding with 'utf-8' fails. Supply a list of\r\n  encodings to `set_encodings()` and dlisio will try them in order.\r\n- `Frame.index` now returns the Channel mnemonic, not the `Channel`-object.\r\n- `Channel.index` is removed.\r\n- Validated types are now represented as tuples, not lists.\r\n- Fixes a bug where microseconds in datetime objects where interpreted as\r\n  milliseconds.\r\n- Better error message when incomplete Channels objects cause parsing of curves\r\n  to fail as a result."}
