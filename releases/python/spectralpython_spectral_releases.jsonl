An associated `noise_from_diffs` function enables\n  estimation of image noise from a homogeneous region of the image.\n\n## Changes\n- When calling `envi.save_image`, assume an ndarray with two dimensions is\n  a single-band image (i.e., don't require an explicit third dimension).\n- [Issue #9] All SpyFile subclass read methods now have an optional\n  `use_memmap` argument to indicate whether the memmap interface should be\n  used (vice direct file read) on a per-call basis. Default values are\n  specific to the particular method and file interleave.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- [Issue #7] Handle recognize comment lines in ENVI headers and accept blank\n  parameter values in the header. Thanks to Don March (http://ohspite.net)\n- [Issue #2] Garbage results were being generated for several algorithms when\n  a NaN value was present in the image data. Reasonable checks are now\n  performed in several algorithms and an optional `allow_nan` argument (False\n  by default) was added to `calc_stats`.\n- [Issue #1] For images with more rows than columns, the row/col of the pixel\n  under the mouse cursor did not display if the row index was greater than\n  the image width.\n\n## Performance Improvements\n- [Issue #5] Improved BilFile.read_bands performance. Thanks to Don March\n  (http://ohspite.net)\n- [Issue #8] Faster creation/display of RGB images for display. Thanks to\n  Don March (http://ohspite.net)\n"}

Cube aspect ratio was being computed incorrectly for\n  non-square images. These bugs were introduced by a recent release.\n- Global covariance was not being scaled properly in the\n  `MahalanobisDistanceClassifier`. Mathematically, it does not affect results\n  and did not affect results on the test data but for large covariance with\n  many classes, it could have cause rounding/truncation that would affect\n  results.\n- PerceptronClassifier constructor was failing due to recent changes in\n  base class code. Unit tests have been added to ensure it continues to work\n  properly.\n\n## Performance Improvements\n- PerceptronClassifier is roughly an order of magnitude faster due to better\n  use of numpy. Inputs are now scaled and weights are initialized withing the\n  data limits, which usually results in fewer iterations for convergence.\n"}
