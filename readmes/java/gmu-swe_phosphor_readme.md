Phosphor: Dynamic Taint Tracking for the JVM
========


Phosphor is a system for performing dynamic taint analysis in the JVM, on commodity JVMs (e.g. Oracle's HotSpot or OpenJDK's IcedTea). This repository contains the source for Phosphor. For more information about how Phosphor works and what it could be useful for, please refer to our [OOPSLA 2014 paper](http://jonbell.net/publications/phosphor), [ISSTA 2015 Tool Demo ](http://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1601) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu). JosÃ© Cambronero also maintains a [series of examples on using Phosphor](https://github.com/josepablocam/phosphor-examples/).

Phosphor has been extensively developed since its original publication, and now includes many features and options not described in the OOPSLA 2014 paper. If you are looking to replicate our OOPSLA 2014 experiments, the easiest way to get the same version with certainty is to use this [VM Image with all relevant files here](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A182689), and to follow the [README with instructions for doing so here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dmebj6k8izams6p/artifact-63-phosphor.pdf?dl=0).

### Refactoring Status and Roadmap
This branch contains what is nearly a complete rewrite of Phosphor, using a less fragile (but slower) approach to pass taint tags between methods. It also is the first version of Phosphor to support Java9+.

Remaining tasks for this branch before promotion:
* Implement control tracking semantics (currently entirely unimplemented)
* Performance optimization
* Improve documentation
* Consider simplifying distribution of the now multiple jars, or alternatively remove the phosphor-distribution module
* Consider removing the PHOSPHOR_TAG field from objects, and remove `MultiTainter.taintedObject`


Running
-------
Phosphor works by modifying your application's bytecode to perform data flow tracking. To be complete, Phosphor also modifies the bytecode of JRE-provided classes, too. The first step to using Phosphor is generating an instrumented version of your runtime environment. We have tested Phosphor with Oracle and OpenJDK Java 8 runtimes. 

The instrumenter takes two primary arguments: first a path containing the classes to instrument, and then a destination for the instrumented classes. You can also specify to track taint tags through control flow, to use objects as tags (instead of integers), or to automatically perform taint marking in particular methods using the various options as shown by invoking Phosphor with the "-help" option.


```
usage: java -jar phosphor.jar [OPTIONS] [input] [output]
 -controlTrack                  Enable taint tracking through control flow
 -help                          print this message
 -withoutDataTrack              Disable taint tracking through data flow
                                (on by default)
```

Phosphor now should be configured to correctly run JUnit tests (with taint tracking) in most environments (Mac + Linux + Windows). Running `mvn verify` should cause Phosphor to generate several different instrumented JRE's (for multitaint use, int-tag taint use, and control track use) into the project's `target` directory, then run unit tests in that JRE that are automatically tracked. You take a look at the test cases to see some example usage. Tests that end in `ObjTagITCase` are executed with Phosphor configured for object tags (multi tainting), and `ImplicitITCase` tests run in the control tracking mode.

### Instrumenting a Java 9+ VM
We'll assume that in all of the code examples below, we're in the same directory as this README.md, that you have already run `mvn package`, and that the JVM is located here: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home` (modify this path in the commands below to match your environment).

For Java >= 9, we generate an instrumented JVM by using the `jlink` tool. We have created a jar (in `phosphor-instrument-jigsaw`) that wraps this entire process, invoking these tools automatically. To instrument the JVM, run this command:
`java -jar phosphor-instrument-jigsaw/target/phosphor-instrument-jigsaw-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home jre-inst`

The next step is to instrument the code which you would like to track. This time, we will use Phosphor's normal instrumenter (not the jigsaw JVM instrumenter), and will pass your entire (compiled) code base to Phosphor for instrumentation, and specify an output folder for that. Example: `java -jar Phosphor/target/Phosphor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar path-to-application output-path-for-instrumented-code`

We can now run the instrumented code using our instrumented JRE, as such:
```
jre-inst/bin/java -javaagent:phosphor-jigsaw-javaagent/target/phosphor-jigsaw-javaagent-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -cp path-to-instrumented-code your.main.class
````


### Instrumenting a Java 8 VM
We'll assume that in all of the code examples below, we're in the same directory (which has a copy of Phosphor-0.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar, which you generated by downloading Phosphor, and running `mvn package`), and that the JRE is located here: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_222.jdk/Contents/Home` (modify this path in the commands below to match your environment).

*Important note on OpenJDK vs Oracle's JDK:* Oracle's JVM requires that the jar that contains all of the cryptography routines (`jce.jar`) be signed by Oracle, for export control purposes. OpenJDK does not. When Phosphor instruments the JVM, it will break these signatures. Hence, it is not possible to use Phosphor with Oracle's JDK *and* use the cryptography functionality of the JVM without some extra work. The first option is (if you have been granted a signing key by Oracle), you can sign the resulting jar. The more attainable option is to instead use the OpenJDK `jce.jar` file with your Oracle JVM, which will not have the signature checks, and will work just fine. Alternatively, if this is too complicated (and you need cryptography support), you can just choose to use OpenJDK entirely (which does not have this check).

Then, to instrument the JRE we'll run:
`java -jar Phosphor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_222.jdk/Contents/Home jre-inst`

After you do this, make sure to chmod +x the binaries in the new folder, e.g. `chmod +x jre-inst/bin/*`

The next step is to instrument the code which you would like to track. This time when you run the instrumenter, pass your entire (compiled) code base to Phosphor for instrumentation, and specify an output folder for that.

We can now run the instrumented code using our instrumented JRE, as such:
```
export JAVA_HOME=jre-inst/
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java  -Xbootclasspath/a:Phosphor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -javaagent:Phosphor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -cp path-to-instrumented-code your.main.class
````

Note: It is not 100% necessary to instrument your application/library code in advance - the javaagent will detect any uninstrumented class files as they are being loaded into the JVM and instrument them as necessary. If you want to do this, then you may want to add the flag `-javaagent:Phosphor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=cacheDir=someCacheFolder` and Phosphor will cache the generated files in `someCacheFolder` so they aren't regenerated every run. If you take a look at the execution of Phosphor's JUnit tests, you'll notice that this is how they are instrumented. It's always necessary to instrument the JRE in advance though for bootstrapping.

New 2/27/19: You can no longer specify auto taint methods (what were sources/sinks/taint through methods) for the static instrumenter. Instead, ALL autotaint instrumentation happens via the java agent (this makes it possible to detect child-classes of auto taint classes). You can specify the files to the java agent using the syntax `-javaagent:Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar=taintSources={taintSourceFile},taintSinks={taintSinksFile},taintThrough={taintThroughFile}`


Interacting with Phosphor
-----
Phosphor exposes a simple API to allow to marking data with tags, and to retrieve those tags. Key functionality is implemented in ``edu.columbia.cs.psl.phosphor.runtime.MultiTainter``. To get or set the taint tag of a primitive type, developers call the taintedX or getTaint(X) method (replacing X with each of the primitive types, e.g. taintedByte, etc.).
Ignore the methods ending with the suffix $$PHOSPHOR, they are used internally.
To get or set the taint tag of an object, first cast that object to the interface TaintedWithObjTag (Phosphor changes all classes to implement this interface), and use the get and set methods.

You can determine if a variable is derived from a particular tainted source by examining the labels on that variable's `Taint` object.

You *can* detaint variables with Phosphor - to do so, simply use the `MultiTainter` interface to set the taint on a value to `0` (or `null`).

Building
------
Phosphor is a maven project. You can generate the jar with a simple `mvn package`. You can run the tests with `mvn verify` (which also generates the jar). Phosphor requires Java 9+ to build, but can be used on Java 8 VMs. If you are making changes to Phosphor and running the tests, you will want to make sure that Phosphor regenerates the instrumented JRE between test runs (because you are changing the instrumentation process). To do so, simply do `mvn clean verify` instead. 

Notes on control tracking
-----
Please note that the control tracking functionality can impose SIGNIFICANT overhead (we've observed > 10x slowdown) depending on the structure of the code you are instrumenting and the amount of tainted data flowing around. This is incredibly un-optimized at this point. This also can make it difficult to apply Phosphor with control tracking to very large methods (since it causes them to grow beyond the maximum size permitted). Nonetheless, we have had great success applying it in various projects --- it works fine on the JDK (perhaps a few internal classes will be too large, but they were not needed in our workloads) and on projects like Tomcat. There are quite a few paths to improving this functionality. If you are interested in helping, please contact us.
