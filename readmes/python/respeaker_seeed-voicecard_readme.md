### Coherence

Estimate the magnitude squared coherence using Welchâ€™s method.
![4-mics-linear-array-kit coherence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3901856/37277486-beb1dd96-261f-11e8-898b-84405bfc7cea.png)  
Note: 'CO 1-2' means the coherence between channel 1 and channel 2.

```bash
# How to get the coherence of the captured audio(a.wav for example).
sudo apt install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib
python tools/coherence.py a.wav

# Requirement of the input audio file:
- format: WAV(Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM
- channels: >=2
```

### uninstall seeed-voicecard

### Technical support

For hardware testing purposes we made a Rasperry Pi OS 5.10.17-v7l+ 32-bit image with reSpeaker drivers pre-installed, which you can download by clicking on [this link](https://files.seeedstudio.com/linux/Raspberry%20Pi%204%20reSpeaker/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-respeaker.img.xz).

We provide official support for using reSpeaker with the following OS:
- 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS
- 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (experimental support)

And following hardware platforms:
- Raspberry Pi 3 (all models), Raspberry Pi 4 (all models), Raspberry Pi Zero and Zero W

Anything beyond the scope of official support is considered to be community supported. Support for other OS/hardware platforms can be added, provided MOQ requirements can be met. 

If you have a technical problem when using reSpeaker with one of the officially supported platforms/OS, feel free to create an issue on Github. For general questions or suggestions, please use [Seeed forum](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/c/products/respeaker/15).
