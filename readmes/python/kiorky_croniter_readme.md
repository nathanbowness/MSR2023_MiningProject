Usage
============

A simple example::

    >>> from croniter import croniter
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> base = datetime(2010, 1, 25, 4, 46)
    >>> iter = croniter('*/5 * * * *', base)  # every 5 minutes
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 04:50:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 04:55:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-25 05:00:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 * * mon,fri', base)  # 04:02 on every Monday and Friday
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-26 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-30 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-02 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 1 * wed', base)  # 04:02 on every Wednesday OR on 1st day of month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-27 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-03 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('2 4 1 * wed', base, day_or=False)  # 04:02 on every 1st day of the month if it is a Wednesday
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-09-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-12-01 04:02:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2011-06-01 04:02:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 * * sat#1,sun#2', base)  # 1st Saturday, and 2nd Sunday of the month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-06 00:00:00
    >>>
    >>> iter = croniter('0 0 * * 5#3,L5', base)  # 3rd and last Friday of the month
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-01-29 00:00:00
    >>> print(iter.get_next(datetime))   # 2010-02-19 00:00:00


All you need to know is how to use the constructor and the ``get_next``
method, the signature of these methods are listed below::

    >>> def __init__(self, cron_format, start_time=time.time(), day_or=True)

croniter iterates along with ``cron_format`` from ``start_time``.
``cron_format`` is **min hour day month day_of_week**, you can refer to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron for more details. The ``day_or``
switch is used to control how croniter handles **day** and **day_of_week**
entries. Default option is the cron behaviour, which connects those
values using **OR**. If the switch is set to False, the values are connected
using **AND**. This behaves like fcron and enables you to e.g. define a job that
executes each 2nd Friday of a month by setting the days of month and the
weekday.
::

    >>> def get_next(self, ret_type=float)

get_next calculates the next value according to the cron expression and
returns an object of type ``ret_type``. ``ret_type`` should be a ``float`` or a
``datetime`` object.

Supported added for ``get_prev`` method. (>= 0.2.0)::

    >>> base = datetime(2010, 8, 25)
    >>> itr = croniter('0 0 1 * *', base)
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-08-01 00:00:00
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-07-01 00:00:00
    >>> print(itr.get_prev(datetime))  # 2010-06-01 00:00:00

You can validate your crons using ``is_valid`` class method. (>= 0.3.18)::

    >>> croniter.is_valid('0 0 1 * *')  # True
    >>> croniter.is_valid('0 wrong_value 1 * *')  # False

About DST
=========
Be sure to init your croniter instance with a TZ aware datetime for this to work!

Example using pytz::

    >>> import pytz
    >>> tz = pytz.timezone("Europe/Paris")
    >>> local_date = tz.localize(datetime(2017, 3, 26))
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

Example using python_dateutil::

    >>> import dateutil.tz
    >>> tz = dateutil.tz.gettz('Asia/Tokyo')
    >>> local_date = datetime(2017, 3, 26, tzinfo=tz)
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

Example using python built in module::

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timezone
    >>> local_date = datetime(2017, 3, 26, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    >>> val = croniter('0 0 * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

About second repeats
=====================
Croniter is able to do second repetition crontabs form::

    >>> croniter('* * * * * 1', local_date).get_next(datetime)
    >>> base = datetime(2012, 4, 6, 13, 26, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter('* * * * * 15,25', base)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:26:15
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:26:25
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime) # 4/6 13:27:15

You can also note that this expression will repeat every second from the start datetime.::

    >>> croniter('* * * * * *', local_date).get_next(datetime)

Testing if a date matches a crontab
===================================
Test for a match with (>=0.3.32)::

    >>> croniter.match("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0))
    True
    >>> croniter.match("0 0 * * *", datetime(2019, 1, 14, 0, 2, 0, 0))
    False
    >>>
    >>> croniter.match("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0)) # 04:02 on every Wednesday OR on 1st day of month
    True
    >>> croniter.match("2 4 1 * wed", datetime(2019, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0), day_or=False) # 04:02 on every 1st day of the month if it is a Wednesday
    False

Gaps between date matches
=========================
For performance reasons, croniter limits the amount of CPU cycles spent attempting to find the next match.
Starting in v0.3.35, this behavior is configurable via the ``max_years_between_matches`` parameter, and the default window has been increased from 1 year to 50 years.

The defaults should be fine for many use cases.
Applications that evaluate multiple cron expressions or handle cron expressions from untrusted sources or end-users should use this parameter.
Iterating over sparse cron expressions can result in increased CPU consumption or a raised ``CroniterBadDateError`` exception which indicates that croniter has given up attempting to find the next (or previous) match.
Explicitly specifying ``max_years_between_matches`` provides a way to limit CPU utilization and simplifies the iterable interface by eliminating the need for ``CroniterBadDateError``.
The difference in the iterable interface is based on the reasoning that whenever ``max_years_between_matches`` is explicitly agreed upon, there is no need for croniter to signal that it has given up; simply stopping the iteration is preferable.

This example matches 4 AM Friday, January 1st.
Since January 1st isn't often a Friday, there may be a few years between each occurrence.
Setting the limit to 15 years ensures all matches::

    >>> it = croniter("0 4 1 1 fri", datetime(2000,1,1), day_or=False, max_years_between_matches=15).all_next(datetime)
    >>> for i in range(5):
    ...     print(next(it))
    ...
    2010-01-01 04:00:00
    2016-01-01 04:00:00
    2021-01-01 04:00:00
    2027-01-01 04:00:00
    2038-01-01 04:00:00

However, when only concerned with dates within the next 5 years, simply set ``max_years_between_matches=5`` in the above example.
This will result in no matches found, but no additional cycles will be wasted on unwanted matches far in the future.

Iterating over a range using cron
=================================
Find matches within a range using the ``croniter_range()`` function.  This is much like the builtin ``range(start,stop,step)`` function, but for dates.  The `step` argument is a cron expression.
Added in (>=0.3.34)

List the first Saturday of every month in 2019::

    >>> from croniter import croniter_range
    >>> for dt in croniter_range(datetime(2019, 1, 1), datetime(2019, 12, 31), "0 0 * * sat#1"):
    >>>     print(dt)


Hashed expressions
==================

croniter supports Jenkins-style hashed expressions, using the "H" definition keyword and the required hash_id keyword argument.
Hashed expressions remain consistent, given the same hash_id, but different hash_ids will evaluate completely different to each other.
This allows, for example, for an even distribution of differently-named jobs without needing to manually spread them out.

    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="hello")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 11, 10)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 11, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="hello")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 11, 10)
    >>> itr = croniter("H H * * *", hash_id="bonjour")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 20, 52)


Random expressions
==================

Random "R" definition keywords are supported, and remain consistent only within their croniter() instance.

    >>> itr = croniter("R R * * *")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 10, 22, 56)
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 22, 56)
    >>> itr = croniter("R R * * *")
    >>> itr.get_next(datetime)
    datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 11, 4, 19)


Keyword expressions
===================

Vixie cron-style "@" keyword expressions are supported.
What they evaluate to depends on whether you supply hash_id: no hash_id corresponds to Vixie cron definitions (exact times, minute resolution), while with hash_id corresponds to Jenkins definitions (hashed within the period, second resolution).
