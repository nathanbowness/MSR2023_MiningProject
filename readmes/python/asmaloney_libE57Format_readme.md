# libE57Format

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/asmaloney/libE57Format)](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/releases/latest) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-orange)](https://asmaloney.github.io/libE57Format-docs/) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/asmaloney/libE57Format)](LICENSE) ![Build](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

A library to provide read & write support for the E57 file format.

This is a fork of [E57RefImpl](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e57-3d-imgfmt/) v1.1.332. The original source is from [E57RefImpl 1.1.332](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e57-3d-imgfmt/files/E57Refimpl-src/) and then everything was stripped out except the main implementation for reading and writing E57.

This version also removes the dependency on [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) and - as of version 3.0 - requires [C++14](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/14). (libE57Format version 2.x required [C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/11).)

Many, many other changes were made prior to the first release of this fork. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and git history for details.

## ðŸš¨ Version 3.0 Note ðŸš¨

There have been many changes (especially to the "Simple API") in the upcoming version 3.0 - some of which will require code changes on your end. Please see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

Since this version is breaking the API, I am happy to discuss any other API-breaking changes which might be useful. Please raise them in [this issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/issues/177).

I plan to let 3.0 sit in the master branch until the end of 2022. If I don't hear any feedback I will go ahead and release it as-is.

## Documentation

The doxygen-generated documentation may be [found here](https://asmaloney.github.io/libE57Format-docs/). These docs are generated and saved in the [libE57Format-docs](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format-docs) repo.

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why Fork?

The E57RefImpl code hasn't been touched in years and I wanted to make changes to compile this library with macOS. Forking it gives me a bit more freedom to update the code and make changes as required.

I changed the name of the project so that it is not confused with the **E57RefImpl** project.

I have also changed the main include file's name from `E57Foundation.h` to `E57Format.h` to make sure there is no inclusion confusion.

Versions of **libE57Format** started at 2.0.

### E57Simple API

Since the original fork, [Jiri HÃ¶rner](https://github.com/ptc-jhoerner) has added the E57Simple API from the old reference implementation and updated it.

This `Simple API` has evolved since this original port to fix some problems and to make it more foolproof & easier to use. Please see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for version 3.

### Tools

[Ryan Baumann](https://github.com/ryanfb) has updated the `e57unpack` and `e57validate` tools to work with **libE57Format**. You can find them in the [e57tools](https://github.com/ryanfb/e57tools) repo.
