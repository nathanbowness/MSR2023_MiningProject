The only difference between `Dry::Struct` and `Dry::Struct::Value` is that the latter is deeply frozen. Freezing objects slows the code down and gives you very little benefit in return.

Again, use `tranform_types` as a work around for `nil`s\r\n* Values are now stored within a single instance variable names `@attributes`, this sped up struct creation and improved support for reserved attribute names such as `hash`, they don't get a getter but still can be read via `#[]`\r\n* Ruby 2.3 is a minimal supported version\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n* `Dry::Struct.transform_types` accepts a block which is yielded on every type to add. Since types are `dry-types`' objects that come with a robust DSL it's rather simple to restore the behavior of `constructor_type`. See https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-struct/pull/64 for details (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n  Example: evaluate defaults on `nil` values\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  class User < Dry::Struct\r\n    transform_types do |type|\r\n      type.constructor { |value| value.nil? ? Undefined : value  }\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `Data::Struct.transform_keys` accepts a block/proc that transforms keys of input hashes. The most obvious usage is simbolization but arbitrary transformations are allowed (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n* `Dry.Struct` builds a struct by a hash of attribute names and types (citizen428)\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  User = Dry::Struct(name: 'strict.string') do\r\n    attribute :email, 'strict.string'\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Support for `Struct.meta`, note that `.meta` returns a _new class_ (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  class User < Dry::Struct\r\n    attribute :name, Dry::Types['strict.string']\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  UserWithMeta = User.meta(foo: :bar)\r\n\r\n  User.new(name: 'Jade').class == UserWithMeta.new(name: 'Jade').class # => false\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `Struct.attribute` yields a block with definition for nested structs. It defines a nested constant for the new struct and supports arrays (AMHOL + flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    class User < Dry::Struct\r\n      attribute :name, Types::Strict::String\r\n      attribute :address do\r\n        attribute :country, Types::Strict::String\r\n        attribute :city, Types::Strict::String\r\n      end\r\n      attribute :accounts, Types::Strict::Array do\r\n        attribute :currency, Types::Strict::String\r\n        attribute :balance, Types::Strict::Decimal\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # ^This automatically defines User::Address and User::Account\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n* Adding a new attribute invalidates `attribute_names` (flash-gordon)\r\n* Struct classes track subclasses and define attributes in them, now it doesn't matter whether you define attributes first and _then_ subclass or vice versa. Note this can lead to memory leaks in Rails environment when struct classes are reloaded (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n[Compare v0.4.0...v0.5.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-struct/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)"}
