This is to avoid various bad thread behaviors, that previous to Ruby 2.0, were allowed.\r\n- The result of the above change removes #add_global_context.\r\n- Currently Scrolls needs to be instantiated to be used (Scrolls.init(options)) however I'd like to work on a method for allowing one to just use Scrolls.log and get sane defaults.\r\n- Due to this massive change I moved to \"single line exceptions\" by default since it lowers the amount of data produced by Scrolls when using #log_exception without losing the information.\r\n- Officially kills Ruby 1.8.7 support (though literally no one should be using that version).\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I don't have a great setup right now to test everything here. I'm testing against Ruby 2.4.1 and all tests pass. Please test if you can. I'm going to cut a release of this version, 0.9.0.pre. I'm jumping versions here since we break backward compatibility. I'm hopeful with this and subsequent versions we can get to a place where a version 1.0 is a reality.\r\n\r\nPlease test this version as much as possible!"}
