Census Reporter API
===================

The home for the API that powers the [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org/) project.

It queries a [census-postgres](https://github.com/censusreporter/census-postgres) database and
generates JSON output that can be read by other clients. One such client is
[censusreporter.org](https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter).

### API Specification
