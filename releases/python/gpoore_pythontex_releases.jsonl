This provides line breaking with\n  fine-grained control over break locations, the ability to highlight\n  specific lines or ranges of lines, improved handling of tabs, and several\n  additional features.\n-  Added `sub` commands and environments (`\\pys`, `pysub`, ...).  These\n  commands and environments perform string interpolation on text.  Fields\n  delimited by `!{...}` are replaced by the result of evaluating and then\n  printing their content.  This works for all families of commands and\n  environments, not just Python.  See the documentation for details about\n  field delimiters and escaping.\n-  Added `rust` and `rs` families of commands and environments.  These\n  provide essentially complete support for Rust, except that\n  `rstex.formatter()`, `rstex.before()`, and `rstex.after()` will\n  likely need additional refinement (#90).\n-  Added the `sage` family of commands and environments, which provide\n  support for Sage (#63).\n-  Added `bash` family of commands and environments.  This provides basic\n  support for bash (no utilities class or equivalent).  Bash works with\n  Windows if it is installed.\n-  Improved `console` compatibility under Linux with Python 3 (#70).\n-  Counters for default sessions are now created automatically.  This prevents\n  counter errors under some circumstances when working with `\\includeonly`.\n-  Commands like `\\py` can now output verbatim content under LuaTeX.\n\n## Bugfixes\n-  Fixed a bug that could cause an endless loop when a `code` command or\n  environment printed a `code` command or environment of the same family\n  with `autoprint=true`.\n"}

Among other things, this allows \n  commands like `\\py` to work in standard captions that have not been \n  redefined to avoid protection issues.\n-  Upgraded `syncpdb` to v0.2, which provides better list formatting.\n\n## Backward-incompatible changes\n-  The default working directory is now the main document directory instead \n  of the output directory.  Using the output directory was a common source \n  of confusion for new users and was incompatible with plans for future \n  development.  Old documents in which the working directory was not \n  specified will continue to use the output directory, but PythonTeX will \n  print an upgrade message; new documents will use the new setting.  The \n  output directory may be selected as the working directory manually, or \n  with the shorthand \n  \"`\\setpythontexworkingdir{<outputdir>}`\".\n-  Standardized version numbering by removing the \"v\" prefix from the stored \n  version numbers in Python variables and LaTeX macros.  Standardized the \n  PythonTeX scripts by renaming `version` to `__version__`.\n"}

This runs a single\n  session in interactive mode, allowing user input. Among other things,\n  this is useful when working with debuggers.\n-  Added `--debug` command-line option. This runs a single session\n  with the default debugger in interactive mode. Currently, only\n  standard (non-console) Python sessions are supported. The default\n  Python debugger is the new `syncpdb`, which wraps `pdb` and\n  synchronizes code line numbers with document line numbers. All\n  `pdb` commands that take a line number or filename:lineno as an\n  argument will refer to document files and line numbers when the\n  argument has a percent symbol (`%`) as a prefix. For example,\n  `list %50` lists code that came from around line 50 in the\n  document. The `--debug` option will support other languages and\n  provide for customization in the future.\n-  Added command-line option `--jobs`, which allows the maximum number\n  of concurrent processes to be specified (#35).\n-  Added support for GNU Octave, via the `octave` family of commands\n  and environments (#36). Parsing of Octave stderr is not ideal, though\n  synchronization works in most cases; this will be addressed by a\n  future rewrite of the stderr parser.\n-  Installer now automatically works with MiKTeX, not just TeX Live.\n-  The PythonTeX utilities class has a new `open()` method that opens\n  files and automatically tracks dependencies/created files.\n-  When `pythontex2.py` and `pythontex3.py` are run directly, the\n  Python interpreter is automatically set to a reasonable default\n  (`py -2` or `py -3` under Windows, using the Python 3.3+ wrapper;\n  `python2` or `python3` under other systems).\n-  The installer now creates symlinks for the numbered scripts\n  `pythontex*.py` and `depythontex*.py`.\n-  Added Python version checking to all numbered scripts.\n-  Under Python, the type of data passed via `\\setpythontexcontext` may \n  now be set using YAML-style tags (`!!str`, `!!int`, `!!float`). For \n  example, `{myint=!!int 123}`.\n-  The `fancyvrb` options `firstline` and `lastline` now work with\n  the `pygments` environment and `\\inputpygments` command. This required \n  some additional patching of `fancyvrb`.\n-  The `pytx@Verbatim` and `pytx@SaveVerbatim` environments are now\n  used for typesetting verbatim code. These are copies of the\n  `fancyvrb` environments. This prevents conflicts when literal\n  `Verbatim` and `SaveVerbatim` environments need to be typeset.\n-  Improved `latexmk` compatibility (#40). Added discussion of\n  `latexmk` usage to documentation.\n-  Tildes `~` may now be used in `outputdir` and `workingdir` to\n  refer to the user\u2019s home directory, even under Windows.\n\n## Bugfixes\n-  Fixed a bug that prevented created files from being cleaned up when\n  the working directory was not the document root directory and the\n  full path to the files was not provided.\n-  Fixed a bug that prevented the `fvextfile` option from working when\n  external files were highlighted.\n"}

Contextual information is stored in the `context` attribute\n  of the utilities class, which is a dictionary (and also has\n  attributes in Python).\n-   The utilities class now has `pt_to_in()`, `pt_to_cm()`, and\n  `pt_to_mm()` methods for converting units of TeX points into inches,\n  centimeters, and millimeters. These work with integers and floats,\n  as well as strings that consist of numbers and optionally end in\n  \"pt\". There is also a `pt_to_bp()` for converting TeX points\n  (1/72.27 inch) into big (DTP or PostScript) points (1/72 inch).\n-   Expanded Quickstart. Quickstart is now compatible with all LaTeX\n  engines. Quickstart now avoids `microtype` issues on some systems\n  (#32).\n-   Added information on citing PythonTeX (#28).\n-   Utilities class has a new attribute `id`, which is a string that\n  joins the command family name, session name, and session restart\n  parameters with underscores. This may be used in creating files that\n  need a name that contains a unique, session-based identifier (for\n  example, names for figures that are saved automatically).\n\n## Backward-incompatible changes\n-   All utilities-class attributes with names of the form `input_*` have\n  been renamed with the \"`input_`\" removed. Among other things, this\n  makes it easier to access the `context` attribute (`pytex.context`\n  vs. `pytex.input_context`).\n-   `depythontex` now has `-o` and `--output` command-line options for\n  specifying the name of the output file. If an output file is not\n  specified, then output is written to `stdout`. This allows\n  `depythontex` output to be piped to another program.\n-   All scripts `*2.py` now have shebangs with `env python2`, and all\n  scripts `*3.py` now have shebangs with `env python3`. This allows\n  the wrapper scripts (`env python` shebang) to be used with the\n  default Python installation, and the numbered scripts to be used\n  with specific versions. Remember that except for console content,\n  the `--interpreter` option is what determines the Python version\n  that actually executes code. The version of Python used to launch\n  `pythontex.py` merely determines the version that manages code\n  execution. (`--interpreter` support for console content is coming.)\n-   Changed the template style used in the `CodeEngine` class.\n  Replacement fields are now surrounded by single curly braces (as in\n  Python's format string syntax), rather than double curly braces.\n  Literal curly braces are obtained by doubling braces. This allows\n  the use of literal adjacent double braces in templates, which was\n  not possible previously.\n-   The Julia template now uses the new `in()` function, replacing\n  `contains()`. This requires Julia v0.2.0+.\n\n## Bugfixes\n-   Modified test for LuaTeX, so that `\\directlua` is not `\\let` to\n  `\\relax` if it does not exist. This was causing incompatibility with\n  `babel` under pdfTeX and XeTeX (#33).\n-   Added missing shebangs to `depythontex*.py`. Handling of `utilspath`\n  is now more forgiving, so that `pythontex_utils.py` can be installed\n  in alternate locations (#23).\n-   `depythontex` no longer leaves a blank line where\n  `\\usepackage{pythontex}` was removed.\n-   Console environments typeset with `fancyvrb` no longer end with an\n  unnecessary empty line.\n-   Fixed bug in installer when `kpsewhich` was not found (#21).\n"}
