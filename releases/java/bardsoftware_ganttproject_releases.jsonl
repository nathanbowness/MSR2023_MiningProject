"\r\n\r\nGanttProject 3.2 is a feature update.\r\n\r\n## Release Highlights\r\n\r\nThere is a short [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ez8v4uTG1E) which demonstrates the major GanttProject 3.2 release highlights.\r\n\r\n**New task table**\r\nTask table was rewritten completely with a few new features:\r\n\r\n* Tasks in the table can be filtered to hide the completed tasks. \r\n* The table can be sorted by any column or by a combination of columns, and the ordering is not destructive with respect to the task structure\r\n* The table menu with \"Manage columns\" and \"Hide completed tasks\" actions is now available through the cog button\r\n\r\n**New Manage Columns dialog**\r\nManage Columns dialog allows for adding new custom task columns and for showing  and hiding the columns in the table. It has got a new look and better user experience in GanttProject 3.2\r\n\r\n**New Print dialog**\r\nThe Print dialog was also completely rewritten. Its controls are now better organized, the paper layout settings are persistent, and the pages can be saved as images in ZIP archive if printing fails.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\nA number of bugs and usability issues were fixed. [Read the full list](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/milestone/18)\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject runs on any modern hardware and operating system which is capable of running Java Runtime. GanttProject requires at most 1Gb of RAM and at most 200Mb of the disk space, including Java Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Windows is shipped as an executable installer bundled with [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime version 11.0.13](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/). Just launch the installer after downloading. Default settings in the installer must be fine for the most of users.\r\n\r\n**Possible reports from anti-virus software**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that an antivirus engine have seen malware which was packed using a similar installer.\r\n\r\nThe installer was [checked by VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/81d097c4a35549c48404c4ebc85c16c9002f60cf2b1b8cd5a464431def7832c4/detection) and at the moment of writing this no engines reported positive results (which is good).\r\n\r\nIf your anti-virus software reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by checking its MD5 checksum. The MD5 sum of the original installer is `10c416b15ae71aefb8deea412e9a84e2`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, try using platform-independent ZIP archive. This distribution includes no native code and doesn't require Administrator privileges. It requires Java Runtime to be installed.\r\n\r\n### macOS\r\n\r\nGanttProject for macOS is shipped as a self-sufficient disk image with a signed and notarized GanttProject application bundled with [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime 11.0.13](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/). The disk image appears as a volume in Finder. You can launch GanttProject directly from the volume or drag it to Applications to install it on macOS system.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Linux is packaged as a `deb` package. JavaFX libraries are included, but Java Runtime is not. The package depends on the virtual package `java11-runtime` which is provided by a number of Java Runtime packages from different vendors. Installing any of them must be sufficient.\r\n\r\nYou can install GanttProject `deb` package using your system package management tools, such as synaptic, Ubuntu software, apt, dpkg, etc. Double-click from the user interface or running `dpkg -i ganttproject_3.2.3210-1_all.deb` in the command line should work.\r\n\r\n### ZIP archive\r\n\r\nZIP archive distro can be used on any platform capable of running Java 11+. Java Runtime is not included and you have to install it separately. See \"Recommended Java Runtime\" section below.\r\n\r\n## Recommended Java Runtime\r\n\r\nGanttProject requires Java Runtime version 11+ with JavaFX modules. It has been developed and tested with BellSoft Liberica Java 11 which is the recommended Java Runtime. However, it appears to run fine with Java 17 as well, and most likely will run with any other version of Java Runtime which is greater than 11 and includes JavaFX modules. \r\n\r\nWe recommend using [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-11-lts). Choose Full JRE option for your platform.\r\n\r\nAnother Java Runtime with JavaFX is [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&package=jre-fx). There is also a very convenient tool called [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) for downloading and managing Java runtimes. It is Linux-native, but it also works fine on macOS and on Windows with GitHub Shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nGanttProject 3.2 is compatible with the files produced by the previous versions of GanttProject 3+. Files produced by GanttProject 3.2 can be read by the previous versions, except that the task filtering will be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n**Maintenance updates**\r\nMaintenance updates, also called patch updates, provide bugfixes and localization improvements. In the dot-separated version number (e.g. 3.2.3210) the third component indicates the patch number.\r\n\r\nWe normally do not introduce new user-visible features in maintenance updates. We guarantee full compatibility between project files and settings produced by different GanttProject versions within the same maintenance update cycle. Maintenance updates are supposed to make GanttProject more stable and less buggy and are supposed to be safe to install.\r\n\r\nMaintenance updates to GanttProject 3.2 will be delivered through the [Update Channel](http://ganttproject.blogspot.com/2020/09/ganttproject-30-packaging-and-update.html). We are targeting at weekly or bi-weekly maintenance update cycles and we highly recommend to keep the auto-update options in the settings switched on.\r\n\r\nWe don't plan to build complete distribution packages for the maintenance updates.\r\n\r\n"}

"\r\n\r\nGanttProject 3.1 is a feature update.\r\n\r\n## Release Highlights\r\n\r\n**Cloud Connection toggle**\r\nA new toggle button in the task bar indicates if GanttProject is connected to GanttProject Cloud. Toggling this on will open the authentication dialog, toggling this off will force sign out from the Cloud.\r\n\r\n**Adding resources from the Cloud**\r\nHuman resource database which is built from the documents stored on GanttProject Cloud and from the team members can be pulled into GanttProject and you can choose the resources to add to your new project.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\nA number of bugs and usability issues were fixed. [Read the full list](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/milestone/17)\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject runs on any modern hardware and operating system which is capable of running Java Runtime.  Packages for Windows and macOS are self-sufficient and do not require installing anything else. DEB package for Linux requires any Java 11+ runtime. ZIP package requires Java 11+ runtime with JavaFX modules. \r\n\r\nGanttProject and Java Runtime totally require about 200Mb of the disk space.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Windows is shipped as an executable installer bundled with [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime version 11.0.11](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/). Just launch the installer after downloading. Default settings in the installer must be fine for the most of users.\r\n\r\n**Possible reports from anti-virus software**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that an antivirus engine have seen malware which was packed using a similar installer.\r\n\r\nThe installer was [checked by VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/48961a97894e827b2e5a36893d144293653852f8bf64efb35aa733aa8721dcf2/detection) and at the moment of writing this no engines reported positive results (which is good).\r\n\r\nIf your anti-virus software reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by checking its MD5 checksum. The MD5 sum of the original installer is `ec23fd39b969825efb84ede3524aa172`\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, try using platform-independent ZIP archive. This distribution includes no native code and doesn't require Administrator privileges. It requires Java Runtime to be installed.\r\n\r\n### macOS\r\n\r\nGanttProject for macOS is shipped as a self-sufficient disk image with a signed and notarized GanttProject application bundled with [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime 11.0.11](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/). The disk image appears as a volume in Finder. You can launch GanttProject directly from the volume or drag it to Applications to install it on macOS system.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Linux is packaged as a `deb` package and includes no Java Runtime. The package lists a number of the known Java Runtime packages in the dependencies. Installing any of them must be sufficient.\r\n\r\nYou can install GanttProject `deb` package using your system package management tools, such as synaptic, Ubuntu software, apt, dpkg, etc. Double-click from the user interface or running `dpkg -i ganttproject_3.1.3102-1_all.deb` in the command line should work.\r\n\r\n### ZIP archive\r\n\r\nZIP archive distro can be used on any platform capable of running Java 11+. Java Runtime is not included and you have to install it separately. GanttProject requires Java Runtime version 11+ with JavaFX modules. We recommend using [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-11-lts). Choose Full JRE option for your platform.\r\n\r\nAnother Java Runtime with JavaFX is [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&package=jre-fx). There is also a very convenient tool called [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) for downloading and managing Java runtimes. It is Linux-native, but it also works fine on macOS and on Windows with GitHub Shell.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nGanttProject 3.1 is fully compatible with the files produced by GanttProject 3.0\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n**Maintenance updates**\r\nMaintenance updates, also called patch updates, provide bugfixes and localization improvements. In the dot-separated version number (e.g. 3.1.3100) the third component indicates the patch number.\r\n\r\nWe normally do not introduce new user-visible features in maintenance updates. We guarantee full compatibility between project files and settings produced by different GanttProject versions within the same maintenance update cycle. Maintenance updates are supposed to make GanttProject more stable and less buggy and are supposed to be safe to install.\r\n\r\nMaintenance updates to GanttProject 3.1 will be delivered through the [Update Channel](http://ganttproject.blogspot.com/2020/09/ganttproject-30-packaging-and-update.html). We are targeting at weekly or bi-weekly maintenance update cycles and we highly recommend to keep the auto-update options in the settings switched on.\r\n\r\nWe don't plan to build complete distribution packages for the maintenance updates.\r\n\r\n"}

"GanttProject 3.0 is a major update. \r\n\r\n## Release Highlights\r\n\r\n**Integration with GanttProject Cloud**\r\n[GanttProject Cloud](https://ganttproject.cloud) is a project collaboration service for GanttProject. If you're working in a team and need to share projects, collaborate safely, keep the history of project revisions, track resource allocations across all projects, you have to try GanttProject Cloud.\r\n\r\n**Bundled Java Runtime and Update Channel**\r\nGanttProject packages for Windows and macOS are bundled with Java Runtime. You don't need to download anything except GanttProject distro. Minor updates are delivered through the update channel and can be installed instantly.\r\n\r\n**Interoperability with Excel and more**\r\nGanttProject can now export projects directly as Excel documents and import them back. There are also a few relatively minor new features which mostly improve application usability.\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject runs on any modern hardware and operating system which is capable of running Java Runtime.  Packages for Windows and macOS are self-sufficient and do not require installing anything else. DEB package for Linux requires any Java 11+ runtime. ZIP package requires Java 11+ runtime with JavaFX modules. \r\n\r\nGanttProject and Java Runtime totally require about 200Mb of the disk space.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Windows is shipped as an executable installer bundled with [BellSoft Liberica Java Runtime](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/).

There is also a very convenient tool called [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) for downloading and managing Java runtimes. It is Linux-native, but it also works fine on macOS and on Windows with GitHub Shell.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nGanttProject 3.0 is fully compatible with the files produced by GanttProject 2.8.+ in both directions. GanttProject 3.0 is compatible with the settings file produced by earlier versions, however, older versions may break when reading a settings file written by GanttProject 3.0\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n**Maintenance updates**\r\nMaintenance updates, also called patch updates, provide bugfixes and localization updates. In the dot-separated version number (e.g. 3.0.3000) the third component indicates the patch number.\r\n\r\nWe normally do not introduce new user-visible features in maintenance updates.

In the dot-separated version number the second component indicates the feature update. \r\n\r\nA new feature update may be less stable than a preceding one with maintenance patches and may introduce new bugs and/or be less localized. Feature updates may also break project file compatibility in the backward direction (that is, earlier versions may not be able to read files produced by newer versions). In the forward direction, newer versions are promised to be able to read files produced by the older versions.\r\n\r\nFeature updates will be packaged as complete packages for all supported platforms and will be available through the Update Channel if that makes sense. We're targeting at monthly or bi-monthly feature update cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

Release Highlights\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.11 is a maintenance and localization update. It comes with updated holiday calendars for the top 20 countries where our users come from, [a number of bugfixes](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/milestone/15?closed=1) and updated Italian, Korean, Turkish and Simplified Chinese translations.\r\n\r\n**Update**: the actual build number is 2396. Build 2393 which was published on April 22 had a couple of severe issues.\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject runs on any modern hardware and operating system which is capable of running Java Runtime.   \r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.11 requires Java Runtime version 7 or higher. Currently there is a number of Java Runtime vendors and versions. GanttProject works with any OpenJDK compatible Java Runtime, however, due to packaging and other reasons, it may not work out of the box with some combinations of operating system, Java Runtime vendor and version. In the sections below for each supported platform you can find combinations which were smoke-tested. \r\n\r\nSmoke test includes installation of Java Runtime and GanttProject on \"clean\" system and launching GanttProject using standard user interface for each platform. We use Java 8 and Java 11 which are LTS (Long-Term Support) versions, legacy Java 7 and the latest Java 14 Runtime. \r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n**File**: `ganttproject-2.8.11-r2396.exe` **MD5 sum**: `c8238c29db34681a65c38d749598c2a7`\r\n \r\nGanttProject for Windows is shipped as an executable installer with no bundled Java Runtime. You need to download and install Java separately.\r\n \r\nGanttProject has been tested on the following configurations:\r\n\r\n* Windows 8 with Oracle Java Runtime version 7\r\n* Windows 8 with AdoptOpenJDK Java Runtime versions 8 and 11 \r\n* Windows 8 with Amazon Corretto Java Runtime versions 8 and 11 \r\n* Windows 10 with AdoptOpenJDK Java Runtime versions 8, 11 and 14 \r\n* Windows 10 with Amazon Corretto Java Runtime versions 8 and 11 \r\n\r\n**Important**: when installing AdoptOpenJDK Java Runtime, make sure to select option \"JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys\" (see the screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![Select registry keys option when installing AdoptOpenJDK Java Runtime on Windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2028330/80037796-f6796f80-84fc-11ea-9454-a0fd67c466bb.png)\r\n\r\nProvided that  Java Runtime is properly installed, run the installer  and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\r\n\r\n**Reports from anti-virus software**\r\n\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that antivirus engine have seen malware packed using similar installer. \r\n\r\nThe installer was [checked by VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/50d325732bbaafde312ae27e99bca50a1a82a1afe19e5765640c59800e6a2ce2/detection) and at the moment of writing this 1 engine out of 59 reported positive results (which is good).\r\n\r\nIf your anti-virus software reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by [checking its MD5 checksum](http://onlinemd5.com/).\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, we recommend [using ZIP distribution](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP). This distribution includes  no native code and doesn't require Administrator privileges. It requires Java Runtime to be installed. \r\n\r\n### macOS\r\n\r\n**File**: `ganttproject-2.8.11-r2396.dmg` **MD5 sum**: `a7bbf11705f8cbba7e8bca902c7eddae`\r\n\r\nDistribution for macOS comes with bundled  [LibericaFX 11.0.7](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11/) Java Runtime. GanttProject application is properly signed and notarized. Just double click it to launch. Optionally, you may drag GanttProject into Applications. \r\n\r\nThis was smoke-tested with the following macOS versions:\r\n\r\n* macOS Catalina 10.15.4\r\n* macOS Mojave 10.14.6\r\n* macOS Sierra 10.12.6\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\n**File**: `ganttproject_2.8.11-r2396-1_all.deb` **MD5 sum**: `a7b7c90c4e96b8995dd55fb314f103e1`\r\n\r\nGanttProject for Linux is packaged as `deb` package and includes no Java Runtime. It requires one of the known Java Runtime packages to be installed. You need to install `deb` package using your system package management tools, such as synaptic, Ubuntu software, apt, dpkg, etc. Double-click from the user interface or `dpkg -i ganttproject_2.8.11-r2396-1_all.deb` should work.\r\n\r\nThis was smoke-tested with the following configurations:\r\n\r\n * Ubuntu 18.04 with `openjdk-8-jre`, `openjdk-11-jre`, `java-11-amazon-corretto-jdk`, `bellsoft-java11-runtime` packages.\r\n \r\n### ZIP distro\r\n\r\n**File**:  `ganttproject-2.8.11-r2396.zip` **MD5 sum**: `8d7ceb2dd751034af97f5c62bec8a67e`\r\n\r\nProvided that `java` command is in `PATH` environment variable, it is enough to unpack the archive and run launcher script from `ganttproject-2.8.11-r2396` folder. Read more [detailed instructions](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP) on the Wiki pages.\r\n\r\nThis was smoke-tested on \r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 18.04 with `bellsoft-java11-runtime` package\r\n* macOS Catalina 10.15.4 with Liberica Java Runtime versions 8,  11, 14 and Zulu Java Runtime version 7 \r\n* Windows 10 with AdoptOpenJDK Java Runtime version 14\r\n"}

We recommend using  [Java Runtime version 8 from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) although more recent runtimes, such as Java 10 or Java 11 shall also be okay.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nProvided that  Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to run the installer executable and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\r\n\r\n**Reports from anti-virus software**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that antivirus engine have seen malware packed using similar installer. \r\n\r\nFile `ganttproject-2.8.10-r2363.exe` was [checked by VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d6a3e69166763c911acb717e7329463239742ff41e1cf262ec0c719044b09785) and at the moment of writing this no engines reported positive results (which is good).\r\n\r\nIf your anti-virus software reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by [checking its MD5 checksum](http://onlinemd5.com/). The original checksum of `ganttproject-2.8.10-r2363.exe` is `8f37f5ad4eb707276f1afecce9e8ee78` (case insensitive).\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, we recommend [using ZIP distribution](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP). It involves no native code (except for Java machine) and doesn't require Administrator priveleges.\r\n\r\n### Mac OSX\r\n\r\nProvided that Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to drag GanttProject application into Applications.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of [possible issues](https://help.ganttproject.biz/t/running-ganttproject-on-macos-mojave-with-java-10/587) with launching GanttProject application on macOS Mojave with Java 10. Please refer to [Knowledge Base article](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/issues/1637) for details.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\nInstall `deb` package using your system software/package management tools. \r\n\r\n### ZIP distro\r\n\r\nProvided that `java` command is available in the command line, it is enough to unpack the archive and run launcher script from `ganttproject-2.8.10-r2363` folder.

Release Highlights\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.8 fixes a number of bugs and improves usability, import/export functions, compatibility with macOS and with the latest Java 10 Runtime.\r\n\r\nThe full list of closed issues is available from the [milestone page](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/milestone/12?closed=1).\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.8 requires Java Runtime version 7 or higher. We recommend using the latest  [Java Runtime from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nProvided that  Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to run the installer executable and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\r\n\r\n**Reports from anti-virus software**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that antivirus engine have seen malware packed using similar installer. \r\n\r\nFile `ganttproject-2.8.8-r2308.exe` was [checked by VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/c1c46c8d693cb02b1e6be7f66bd4028f273699b7c2b2abfd9f5e8a2e79c81f28/detection) and at the moment of writing this only 1 out of 61 engines reported positive results (which is good).\r\n\r\nIf your anti-virus software reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by [checking its MD5 checksum](http://onlinemd5.com/). The original checksum of `ganttproject-2.8.8-r2308.exe` is `b23b1f62368ac95b12b7283420ea98fc` (case insensitive).\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, we recommend [using ZIP distribution](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP). It involves no native code (except for Java machine) and doesn't require Administrator priveleges.\r\n\r\n### Mac OSX\r\n\r\nProvided that Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to drag GanttProject application into Applications.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\nInstall `deb` package using your system software/package management tools. \r\n\r\n### ZIP distro\r\n\r\nProvided that `java` command is available in the command line, it is enough to unpack the archive and run launcher script from `ganttproject-2.8.8-r2308` folder.

We recommend using the latest  [Java Runtime from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nProvided that  Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to run the installer executable and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\r\n\r\n**Viruses in the installer**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer.

Release Highlights\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.5 comes with a new feature: task sorting by begin and end dates. \r\n\r\nOne can sort by begin date by clicking the `Begin date` column header in the table. The second click will reverse the ordering. Clicking on `End date` will sort by end date. \r\n\r\nThe sort order is partial.

Release Highlights\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.4 greatly improves user interface scalability which makes easier the life of happy owners of Macs with Retina screens, Microsoft Surface Pro devices and other high-density displays.\r\n\r\nDPI configuration option which was introduced in GanttProject 2.8.3 is now considered in almost all parts of the user interface, including toolbar icons and milestone and arrow shapes on Gantt chart. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately apps do not know the physical size of the screen and pixel density, so users need to configure DPI setting manually. Most of the mere mortals will want to leave the default value 96. Those who use High-DPI screens should set the value appropriate for their screens. Most likely values in [150..200] range will be fine. Changing the option value is safe, it just scales fonts and graphics in GanttProject linearly. Play with the option and choose the best value for your screen.\r\n\r\n> **We recommend restarting GanttProject after changing DPI option value**\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\nThe list of closed tickets is available on [release milestone page](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/issues?q=milestone%3A2.8.4+is%3Aclosed)\r\n\r\nAlso, iCal import plugin configuration was fixed and it [doesn't need any hacking](http://ganttproject.blogspot.com/2017/03/ganttproject-283-how-to-get-back-ical.html) anymore.\r\n\r\n## Installation notes and system requirements\r\n\r\nGanttProject 2.8.4 requires Java Runtime version 7 or higher. We recommend using the latest  [Java Runtime from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nProvided that  Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to run the installer executable and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\r\n\r\n**Viruses in the installer**\r\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that antivirus engine have seen malware packed using similar installer.\r\n\r\nFile `ganttproject-2.8.4-r2134.exe` was [checked by VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/en/file/8b837a9bb13289975a2889259846b21ce1c64f1645eeb2e6b6d55818de9097d1/analysis/) and at the moment of checking no engines reported any viruses.\r\n\r\nIf your engine reports positive result, this is most likely a false positive, provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one. You can check if you downloaded the original file by [checking its MD5 checksum](http://onlinemd5.com/). The original checksum of `ganttproject-2.8.4-r2134.exe` is `643a2d2290a4985ea6a976c868cb92de` (case insensitive).\r\n\r\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, we recommend [using ZIP distribution](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP). It involves no native code (except for Java machine) and doesn't require Administrator priveleges.\r\n\r\n### Mac OSX\r\n\r\nProvided that Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to drag GanttProject application into Applications.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\r\n\r\nInstall `deb` package using your system software/package management tools. \r\n"}

"Updated calendars, translations and a few bugfixes. The list of closed bugs is available on [release milestone page](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/issues?q=milestone%3A2.8.2+is%3Aclosed)\n\n## Installation notes and system requirements\n\nGanttProject 2.8.2 requires Java Runtime version 7 or higher. We recommend using the latest  [Java Runtime from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).\n\n### Windows\n\nProvided that  Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to run the installer executable and complete the wizard steps to install GanttProject.\n\n**Upgrading from previous versions**\nAssorted effects, such as duplicated exports or [broken Properties dialog](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/issues/1348), may be observed if GanttProject 2.8.2 is installed on top of GanttProject 2.8.1 into the same folder. \n\nInstall GanttProject 2.8.2 into a clean (or new) folder. However, if you have already installed it on top of 2.8.1, you can just remove folder `plugins/net.sourceforge.ganttproject` from the installation folder to fix the issue.\n\n**Viruses in the installer**\nSome anti-virus programs may report viruses in the installer. This is a known issue which happens to installers very often. It doesn't mean that the file is infected, it rather means that antivirus engine have seen malware packed using similar installer. File `ganttproject-2.8.2-r2069.exe` was [checked with VirusTotal online service](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7f53d07741264487698d6e7cda8e0687e2b881cce811fdeb423d1f7a20e17118/analysis/1487669785/) and only 2 out of 57 antivirus engines reported positive results. Provided that the file which you downloaded is the original one, we're certain that positive results  are false  positive. You can check if you downloaded the original file by [checking its MD5 checksum](http://onlinemd5.com/). The original checksum of `ganttproject-2.8.2-r2069.exe` is `6c512df96e5ad09c34540fc7a27761d8` (case insensitive).\n\nIf you can't or don't want to run program which your antivirus engine considers as infected, we recommend [using ZIP distribution](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/wiki/Installing-from-ZIP). It involves no native code (except for Java machine) and doesn't require Administrator priveleges.\n\n### Mac OSX\n\nProvided that Java Runtime is installed, it is enough to drag GanttProject application into Applications.\n\n### Ubuntu/Mint/ other Debian-based Linux distros\n\nInstall `deb` package using your system software/package management tools. \n"}
