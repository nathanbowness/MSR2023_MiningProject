MULTI-DATA SOURCE MODELING AND INVERSION TOOLKIT

MudPy v.1.0

A code to run forward models of dislocation sources as well as invert for them 
with multiple geophysical data types:

** Data types that MudPy can simulate and invert:
	+ Displacement seismograms
	+ Velocity seismograms
	+ Static field vectors
	+ Tsunami waveforms 
	+ InSAR line of sight offsets

** MudPy can do:

FORWARD MODELING of static point source
FORWARD MODELING of static slip distributions
FORWARD MODELING of kinematic point sources
FORWARD MODELING of kinematic slip distributions

INVERSION of a static point source
INVERSION of static slip distributions
INVERSION of kinematic point sources
INVERSION of kinematic slip distributions

STOCHASTIC SLIP MODEL generation

There are simple examples on the wiki but unfortunately not a whole lot of documentation since I'm still working on this although the 
code is thoroughly commented.

NOTES:
Uses fk code from Zhu & Rivera (2002, GJI) for Green functions calculations. This 
code is bundled here but make sure to refer to the original source for updates.

Tsunami inversion relies on Geoclaw (http://www.clawpack.org) for caluclation of Green functions
