The main win is that we now can skip the painful installation of COLMAP and install all dependencies with pip. This means that we can run hloc in Google Colab, with GPUs, for free. Most of these additions have been made possible by the awesome work of @Phil26AT on pycolmap.\r\n\r\n- Demo notebook in Google Colab - SfM and localization right in your browser!\r\n- Use the new pycolmap Reconstruction objects and pipeline API\r\n  - Do not require an installation of COLMAP anymore - pycolmap is enough\r\n  - Faster model reading and writing\r\n  - Fine-grained control over camera sharing via the `camera_mode` parameter\r\n  - Localization with unknown or inaccurate focal length\r\n- Modular localization API with control over all estimator parameters\r\n- 3D visualizations or camera frustums and points with plotly\r\n- Package-specific logging in the hloc namespace\r\n- Store the extracted features by default as fp16 instead of fp32\r\n- Optionally fix a long-standing bug in SuperPoint descriptor sampling\r\n- Add script to compute exhaustive pairs for reconstruction or localization\r\n- Require pycolmap>=0.1.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization/releases/56360370/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 5, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 1}
