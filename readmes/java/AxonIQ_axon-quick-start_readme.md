Axon Labs - Chat Application
============================

This project contains the source code for the Axon Labs. It contains two modules:

- *chat-getting-started*:  
  Use this module if you want to get a feel of how Axon works. The project contains a minimal 
  setup. You will need to implement the Command Model, the Event Handlers and the Query Handlers,
  and connect the public API to the command bus and the query bus.

- *chat-scaling-out*:  
  Use this module if you want to take on a more advanced challenge. The project contains a fully 
  operational chat application. It's your task to change the configuration to distribute commands
  and events across multiple instances of the application.
