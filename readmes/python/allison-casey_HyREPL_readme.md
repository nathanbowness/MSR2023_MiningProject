HyREPL
======

HyREPL is an implementation of the [nREPL](https://nrepl.org)
protocol for [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy).

Experimental!
=============
HyREPL requires Python3 and Hy from Git. It is still a work in progress, but it
is suitable for daily usage :)

To install, run

    python setup.py install

or get it from pypi

    pip install hyrepl

To run the tests, simply execute `nosetests-3.4 -v`. The tests create (and bind
to) a UNIX domain socket at `/tmp/HyREPL-test`.

Confirmed working nREPL clients
-------------------------------

This list is not exhaustive, and HyREPL does not support all features offered by
these clients, such as advanced debugger integration, profiling or tracing. Jump
to source is also not supported.

### Lighttable
* Support live eval by connecting with `Clojure nrepl`. Still basic and buggy 

### Vim
* `fireplace` with [vim-hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy) to provide the
  necessary glue

### Emacs
* `cider`
* `monroe`

### Console
* `python-nrepl-client`

Using HyREPL with fireplace
===========================

For the best integration, install [vim-hy](https://github.com/hylang/vim-hy). It
offers syntax highlighting and indentation support as well as wrappers around
fireplace to make it more Hy-friendly.

Run `hy -m HyREPL.server` in your target directory and open a Hy file in vim.
You can also use `:setf hy` to set the file type explicitly.  Connect vim to the
REPL with `:Connect`.  Use `nrepl` as the protocol, `localhost` as the host and
the port number HyREPL printed on start.

Without `vim-hy`
----------------
Open a Hy file and set the file type to `clojure`: `set filetype=clojure`. This
will suck because it doesn't support `:Doc`. Other things might be broken as
well.

Missing features
----------------
* `:Require[!]` does not yet work. Use `:%Eval` to evaluate complete files.
* fireplace uses a lot of clojure-specific pieces of code. Most of these could
  be transformed with workarounds.

Using HyREPL inside your own programs
=====================================
You can use HyREPL to add a remote control to your own programs. The following
steps are a small example:

    (import time
      [HyREPL.server :as repl]
      [HyREPL.middleware.eval :as repl-mw])
    (setv (. repl-mw eval-module) (globals))
    (defmain [&rest args]
      (let [[s (repl.start-server)]]
        (print (.format "Listening on {}" (. (second s) server-address)))
        (while True
          (time.sleep 1))))
