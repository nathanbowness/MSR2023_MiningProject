However, for flows with strong body forces, as well for the meshes with irregularities on the wall, the Gaussian theorem might prove to be an useful addition to the arsenal of numerical tools it had.  So ... just before introducing the Gaussian gradients, I mark this release in the \"membrane\" branch to have a safe point to return to if things go royally bad with Gaussian method.  It is a safety measure.  The tests I am performing at the moment of drafting this release seem to show that Gaussian method works just fine."}
