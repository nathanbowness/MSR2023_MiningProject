Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Sismic* is a recursive acronym that stands for *Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker*.

Statecharts are a well-known visual modeling language for representing the executable behavior
of complex reactive event-based systems. Sismic library for Python (version 3.5 or higher) provides a set of
tools to define, validate, simulate, execute and test statecharts.
More specifically, Sismic provides:

- An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
- A statechart interpreter offering a discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
- Fully controllable simulation clock, with support for real and simulated time
- Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code, can be easily extended to other programming languages
- Support for Design by Contract (DbC) for statecharts: contracts can be specified to express invariants, pre- and postconditions on states and transitions
- Runtime monitoring of behavioral properties expressed as statecharts
- Built-in support for behavior-driven development (BDD)
- Support for communication between statecharts
- Synchronous and asynchronous executions
- Statechart visualization using `PlantUML <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml>`__


Installation
------------

Sismic requires Python >=3.5.
Sismic can be installed using ``pip`` as usual: ``pip install sismic``.
This will install the latest stable version.

You can also install Sismic from this repository by cloning it.

Starting from release 1.0.0, Sismic adheres to a `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`__ scheme.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the latest distributed version is available on `sismic.readthedocs.io <http://sismic.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Many examples are available in `docs/examples <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/master/docs/examples>`_.

The documentation can also be directly built from the `docs <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/master/docs>`_ directory using Sphinx.

The scientific article `A method for testing and validating executable statechart models <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-0676-3>`_ presenting the method and techniques supported by Sismic for validating and testing statecharts, is published in Springer's Software and Systems modeling journal in 2018.


Changelog
---------
