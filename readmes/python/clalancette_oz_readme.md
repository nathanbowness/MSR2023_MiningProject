Oz is a set of programs and classes to do automated installations of
operating systems.  It is useful for creating virtual machine disk
images containing an operating systems and, optionally, programs.

The best way to install it is to make an RPM out of it by running "make rpm"
or "make srpm", and then installing the resulting RPM on the target machine.

Once you have the RPM installed, you will need to build up TDL files to feed
as input into the building process.  Please see the examples directory to get
an idea of what a TDL file looks like.
