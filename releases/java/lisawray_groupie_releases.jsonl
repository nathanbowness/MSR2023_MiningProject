In additional to using your existing ViewHolders, you can add new items to your list with shared generic viewholders using Kotlin Android Extensions or Android's data binding.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you've been using the pre-release version, this is a breaking change in the `groupie-kotlin-android-extensions` library.\r\n\r\n- Fix for the problem where Kotlin Android extensions didn't support view caching in view holders.  (Note, if you are using Kotlin Android extensions in your own viewholders and you are not manually caching the view references, you have this problem too.)\r\n\r\nIn order to enable support, please update to the latest Kotlin (at least 1.2) and enable the experimental flag using \r\n\r\n```\r\nandroidExtensions {\r\n    experimental = true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fixes necessary for view caching are already in the `groupie-kotlin-android-extensions` library. However:\r\n- References formerly on the item view such as `viewHolder.itemView.title` are now on the viewholder, e.g. `viewHolder.title`.  \r\n- The import required for Android Extensions has changed and no longer requires `.view.*`\r\n\r\nMore information on the feature can be found here: https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/android-extensions-entity-caching.md\r\n\r\n- Bug fix in ExpandableGroup.addAll() (#108, #109)\r\n- Bug fix for notifications in Section.removeAll() \r\n- Add Group.removeAt(int index)\r\n- Small fixes to example project\r\n- `UpdatingGroup` is now deprecated and `Section.update()` has been added.\r\n\r\nThanks to contributors @pzgz, @hardysim, @kjones, @SimonMarquis, and all others who have used and tested the last few releases! \r\n\r\nHappy New Year :)\r\n"}

By default, they are unique, auto-generated, integers.  You can change these to reflect the id (for example, the primary key) of a model object the item represents.\n- An OnClickListener a la ListView is now optional. Instead of passing it in the constructor, you can add it via setOnClickListener().\n- UpdatingGroup can now accept and diff any list of Items. You should override Item.getId() and Item.equals() on all items that will be compared in order to ensure correct diffing.\n- Several bug fixes and enhancements in the example project.\n\nThanks everyone who contributed!\n"}
