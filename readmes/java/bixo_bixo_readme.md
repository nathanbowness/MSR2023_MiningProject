Introduction
===============================

Bixo is an open source Java web mining toolkit that runs as a series of Cascading
pipes. It is designed to be used as a tool for creating customized web mining apps.
By building a customized Cascading pipe assembly, you can quickly create a workflow
using Bixo that fetches web content, parses, analyzes, and publishes the results.

Bixo borrows heavily from the Apache Nutch project, as well as many other open source
projects at Apache and elsewhere.

Bixo is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Building
===============================

See http://openbixo.org/documentation/building-bixo/ for full details.

You need Apache Ant 1.7 or higher. 

To get a list of valid targets:

% cd <project directory>
% ant -p

To  clean and build a jar (which also runs all tests):

% ant clean jar

Note that "ant clean test jar" will currently fail, due to a bug in the maven ant task
plugin used for managing dependencies.

To create Eclipse project files:

% ant eclipse

Then, from Eclipse follow the standard procedure to import an existing Java project into your Workspace.
