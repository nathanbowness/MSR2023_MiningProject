PyNDN: A Named Data Networking client library with TLV wire format support in native Python
===========================================================================================

PyNDN 2.0 is a new implementation of a Named Data Networking client library written in pure Python.
It is wire format compatible with the NDN-TLV encoding.

See the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions to build and run from the full distribution.

If you are new to the NDN community of software generally, read the
[Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/named-data/NFD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Proposed code contributions should use a
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/named-data/PyNDN2/pulls).

If you only need to install the pyndn Python module, you can use easy_install.
(If you don't have easy_install, see the instructions at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions .)
To avoid installation problems, make sure you have the latest version of pip.

For macOS, in a terminal, enter:

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install cryptography
    sudo easy_install pyndn

For Ubuntu or Raspbian (Raspberry Pi), in a terminal, enter:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip
    sudo easy_install pyndn

For Windows Cygwin, in the Cygwin installer, select and install the "Devel"
packages at the top level of the installer. In a terminal, enter:

    easy_install pyndn

This installs the pyndn module on the Python search path so that applications
which depend on it can use it, but does not install the sample tests or documentation
files. If you need these other files, then use the full distribution and see the INSTALL.md file.

The library currently requires a remote NDN daemon, and has been tested with NFD from the package
https://github.com/named-data/NFD .

The API follows the NDN Common Client Library API also used by ndn-cpp (C++) and ndn-js (JavaScript).
See http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api .

Since PyNDN 2.0 conforms to the new Common Client Library API, applications written in the pre-2.0 version
of PyNDN need to be upgraded.
