I hope the new additions are of use to everyone else. :)\n"}

Hope you will find it useful.\n\nThe other PR is regarding failure to fetch blog posts, planet used to simply crash and ask you to retry the whole process which wasn't all that smart, thanks to Srihari we now have tolerance to failure in fetching (and the code for that is super tidy)\n\nAll in all, I thought I'd bump the version of planet and release all this for everyone. Happy planetin'! :dancers: \n"}
