A PyVISA backend that implements a large part of the "Virtual Instrument Software
Architecture" (VISA_) in pure Python (with the help of some nice cross platform
libraries python packages!).

Description
-----------

PyVISA started as wrapper for the IVI-VISA library and therefore you need to install
a VISA library in your system (National Instruments, Keysight, etc). This works
most of the time, for most people. But IVI-VISA implementations are proprietary
libraries that only works on certain systems. That is when PyVISA-py jumps in.

Starting from version 1.6, PyVISA allows to use different backends. These
backends can be dynamically loaded. PyVISA-py is one of such backends. It
implements most of the methods for Message Based communication
(Serial/USB/GPIB/Ethernet) using Python and some well developed, easy to deploy
and cross platform libraries

VISA and Python
---------------

Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement
controlling:

- Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.
- It represents a high abstraction level, which perfectly blends with the
  abstraction level of measurement programs.
- It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting
  modules for data analysis and visualisation.
- A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is available.


Requirements
------------

- Python (tested with 3.6+)
- PyVISA 1.11+

Optionally:

- PySerial (to interface with Serial instruments)
- PyUSB (to interface with USB instruments)
- linux-gpib (to interface with gpib instruments, only on linux)
- gpib-ctypes (to interface with GPIB instruments on Windows and Linux)
- psutil (to discover TCPIP devices across multiple interfaces)


Installation
--------------

Using pip:

    $ pip install pyvisa-py


Documentation
--------------
