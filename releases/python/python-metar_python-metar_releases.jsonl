A few volunteers including @phobson and @akrherz look to maintain this library doing forward.  The best way to submit bug reports is through Github.\r\n\r\nThe 1.6.0 release is the first made by our new organization and signifies an effort to fix bugs and improve the API.  Here are some of the highlights with this release.\r\n\r\n - The `Metar` constructor now supports a `strict` parameter (see #51 and #36). When `strict=False`, the parsing of METARs will not raise exceptions for parsing failures nor unparsed groups.\r\n - Python 3.6 is formally supported and actively tested against.\r\n - `print` statements were replaced by standard library loggers.\r\n - In the case of a METAR that contains sea-level pressure (SLP) and not altimeter, the METAR object attribute `press` is left unset. (see #38)\r\n - METAR precipitation and snow reports can be of `Trace` value. (see #34)\r\n - It is now possible to override some class attributes (see #37)\r\n - Add support for METAR 4/ group (snow depth) (see #31)\r\n - Add method to show recent weather as string (see #21)\r\n - A few sundry code fixes, cleanups, and improvements to automated testing\r\n"}
