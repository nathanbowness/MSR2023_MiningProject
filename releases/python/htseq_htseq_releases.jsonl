It supports cell barcodes, which result in different columns of\r\n  the output count table, and unique molecular identifiers.\r\n- ``htseq-count`` has new option ``-n`` for multicore parallel processing\r\n- ``htseq-count`` has new option ``-d`` for separating output columns by arbitrary character\r\n  (defalt TAB, ``,`` is also common)\r\n- ``htseq-count`` has new option ``-c`` for output into a file instead of stdout\r\n- ``htseq-count`` has new option ``--append-output`` for output into a file by appending to\r\n  any existing test (e.g. a header with the feature attribute names and sample names)\r\n- ``htseq-count`` has two new values for option ``--nonunique``, namely ``fraction``, which\r\n  will count an N-multimapper as 1/N for each feature, and ``random``, which will assign\r\n  the alignment to a random one of its N-multimapped features. This feature was added by\r\n  ewallace (thank you!).\r\n- ``htseq-qa`` got refactored and now accepts an options ``--primary-only`` which ignores\r\n  non-primary alignments in SAM/BAM files. This means that the final number of alignments\r\n  scored is equal to the number of reads even when multimapped reads are present.\r\n\r\nTesting improvements:\r\n\r\n- Extensive testing and installation changes for Mac OSX 10.14 and later versions\r\n- Testing Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 on OSX\r\n- Testing and deployment now uses conda environments\r\n\r\nNumerous bugfixes and doc improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is the **last** version of ``HTSEQ`` supporting Python 2.7, as it is unmaintained since Jan 1st, 2020. ``HTSeq`` will support Python 3.5+ from the next version."}
