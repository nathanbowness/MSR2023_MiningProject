An example has been added in kortex_examples for usage of that server, both in [C++](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_examples/src/full_arm/example_waypoint_action_client.cpp) and [Python](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_examples/src/full_arm/example_waypoint_action_client.py).\r\n- The kortex_driver has been adapted to use the new Joint Waypoints API and the Action Server for playing Joint Trajectories (used by MoveIt) has been modified to use that API instead of the pre-computed joint trajectories.\r\n- As a direct consequence of the previous point, the MoveIt configuration for all arms has been adapted to use the `AddIterativeSplineParameterization` [Time Parametrization algorithm](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/master/moveit_ros/planning/planning_request_adapter_plugins/src/add_iterative_spline_parameterization.cpp), which fixes the problem of trajectories being rejected because velocity or acceleration values exceed the limits of the robot. This also makes MoveIt create trajectories much more in line with the robot's limits, as previous implementations forced velocity and acceleration limits to be tuned down for these errors to be avoided.\r\n- The fix to the memory leak bug (which directly impacted MoveIt users) now enables the arm to properly run MoveIt trajectories in a loop without facing a mandatory reboot after some time."}

We implemented only the most important RPCs : the ones related to moving and stopping the arm and its gripper. You can see the list of handlers [in the source code](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver/src/non-generated/driver/kortex_arm_driver.cpp#L656-L685). They include the *Action ROS services as well as their specific counterpart (PlayCartesianTrajectory, PlayJointTrajectory, SendGripperCommand, ApplyEmergencyStop).\r\n\r\nThe SendTwist implementation has been kept in the code as a POC, [but commented out](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver/src/non-generated/driver/kortex_arm_driver.cpp#L677-L678) because the arm was shaky in some positions and not stable enough. Users can uncomment this to see the behaviour and start from this code if they want to achieve simulated twist commands. We won't work on enhancing this in the short term. We didn't find the root cause for the shaking but it may be because of the PID gains not tuned enough, or the command rate of the simulated ROS Control individual position controllers.  \r\n\r\nYou can have a look at the [new kortex_examples documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_examples/readme.md#the-ways-to-use-a-kortex-arm-with-ros) to learn more about the details and the differences between simulated and real arms. \r\n\r\nThe entry-point for real arms is still [kortex_driver.launch](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver/launch/kortex_driver.launch) and the entry-point for simulated arms is still [spawn_kortex_robot.launch](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_gazebo/launch/spawn_kortex_robot.launch).\r\n\r\n## What's changed/fixed\r\n\r\n- #88 the `prefix` option for both the simulated and real arm now also prefixes MoveIt configurations correctly. This is useful if you want to run multiple robots on a given ROS network (make sure to also set the `robot_name` parameter to namespace your robot!)\r\n- #90 The implementation of the PlayCartesianTrajectory and ExecuteAction ROS services for a simulated arm makes it possible for simulation users to send the arms to a Cartesian pose, without computing the IK themselves. We use KDL in the `kortex_driver` to do this. Since the real arm has its own IK implementation, paths may vary between simulation and real arms (especially for the Gen3 7DOF).\r\n- The Gen3 lite users now don't have to specify a gripper when launching the driver since the default (and only) gripper is `gen3_lite_2f`.\r\n\r\n## Using simulated services that are not implemented\r\n\r\nIt is possible for users to implement simulation handlers for every call in the Kortex API. We did implement the most crucial ones and don't plan in the short term to implement more, but there is only one function call to add in the kortex_arm_driver and one handler to define in the kortex_arm_simulation to implement your own simulated behaviour for one of our Kortex API RPCs in simulation.\r\n\r\nBy default, unimplemented handlers for simulated services return the default value for their Response data structure and print a warning in the terminal.

The tool frame used by the arms firmware was added to the kortex_description packages as the `tool_frame` link. This link was also added to the `arm` MoveIt planning group, so if you had Cartesian trajectories planned with MoveIt, be aware that the last arm link is now `tool_frame` to match the end effector pose present in the robot's feedback. You can see the definition for the link in TF with RViz, or in the source URDF for [the Robotiq 2F-85](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_description/grippers/robotiq_2f_85/urdf/robotiq_arg2f_85_model_macro.xacro#L198-L205), [the Robotiq 2F-140](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_description/grippers/robotiq_2f_140/urdf/robotiq_arg2f_140_model_macro.xacro#L236-L242) and [the Gen3 lite gripper](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_description/grippers/gen3_lite_2f/urdf/gen3_lite_2f_macro.xacro#L6-L13).\r\n- #98 fixed a problem where the Robotiq grippers would fly away in Gazebo.\r\n- A touch of colour was added to the Gen3 lite simulation model. A more realistic colour texture will be added in the future.\r\n-  A fix for the `prefix` option in the driver was made so the action server would use it correctly. The option is still not supported in simulation and will be fixed in the short term.\r\n- Instructions were added [here](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex#build) to build the ROS Kortex packages for ARMV8 architecture.\r\n- Building with `catkin_make_isolated` and `catkin tools` is now supported."}

You can read more about how the Teaching mode functions in the User Guide.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41082816/75356645-3bc34d00-587e-11ea-9381-b7e9a934f5f4.png)\r\n- Controller mappings are now configurable (you can access the tab in Configurations->Controllers):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41082816/75357013-b4c2a480-587e-11ea-95b7-d15360bc2a5c.png)\r\n\r\n### Changes to the ROS Kortex packages\r\n- The Kortex API is now hosted on our Conan Artifactory server and a Conan installation procedure [has been added](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/tree/kinetic-devel#build). Once Conan is installed on your machine, the API will be automatically downloaded by Conan instead. You can read more about the Conan package manager [here](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/). You can still use the old way of building ROS Kortex and download it on Artifactory [(see details in this section)](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/tree/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver#about-conan).\r\nEssentially, to install Conan, run those lines (make sure you have python3 and pip installed):\r\n```\r\nsudo python3 -m pip install conan\r\nconan config set general.revisions_enabled=1\r\nconan profile new default --detect > /dev/null\r\nconan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default\r\n```\r\n- A new deprecation message was added to the API for some functions. With ROS, you'll get a runtime warning when calling the deprecated services in the kortex_arm_driver window output.\r\n- Added an option to use the arm's hard limits as soft limits (Gen3 only). This enables the arm to use MoveIt at full speed, with modified joint speed and acceleration limits. The hard joint limits can be found, for example, in [this file](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_move_it_config/gen3_move_it_config/config/6dof/hard_joint_limits.yaml). You can read more about it in the **use_hard_limits** parameter [in this section](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/tree/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver#usage). **Be aware that enabling this parameter will automatically set your arm's soft limits to the hard limits, so your arm will move a lot faster! Be cautious when turning it on for the first time!**\r\n- Added the description and MoveIt config's for the 6DOF arms, and support for Gen3 arms without vision modules. "}

You may have to remap some ROS topics, ROS services and refactor some launch files. You can see all the details in the [dedicated compatibility section](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/tree/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver#compatibility).\r\n\r\n- The base branch of the repository has been changed to `kinetic-devel` and the `master` branch has been deleted. If you were on the `master` branch, you can simply checkout to the `kinetic-devel` branch :\r\n    ```\r\n    git fetch\r\n    git checkout kinetic-devel\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Instructions to update your ros_kortex package to v2.0.0\r\n1. Checkout `kinetic-devel` branch and pull the latest version :\r\n```bash\r\ncd path_to_your_catkin_ws/src/ros_kortex\r\ngit fetch\r\ngit checkout kinetic-devel\r\ngit pull\r\n```\r\n2. Remove the kortex_api/include and kortex_api/lib folder (because they are currently at 1.1.7):\r\n```bash \r\nrm -rf kortex_api/include kortex_api/lib\r\n```\r\n3. Install the new dependencies:\r\n```bash\r\ncd path_to_your_catkin_ws\r\nrosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src\r\n```\r\n4. Clean and build the package. The Kortex API v2.0.0 will be automatically downloaded and extracted to the correct location during catkin_make [as the documentation explains](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_api/readme.md). \r\n```bash\r\ncd path_to_your_catkin_ws\r\nrm -rf devel build\r\ncatkin_make\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's new\r\n\r\n- The `kortex_actuator_driver`, `kortex_device_manager` and `kortex_vision_config_driver` packages have been removed and `kortex_driver` has been updated to include all of the Kortex API functionalities. You can read more about the ROS topics, ROS services and functionalities of the driver [in the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_driver/readme.md).\r\n- The  `kortex_control` package has been added. It provides a basic ROS Control interface for the simulated Gen3 arm in Gazebo. You can read more about the `kortex_control` package [in the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_control/readme.md). Support for a ROS Control interface with the real Gen3 arm is not present yet and will be added in a future release.\r\n- The `kortex_description` package now supports the Robotiq 2-fingers 85 gripper.\r\n- The `kortex_examples` package has been updated to use services and topics from the updated `kortex_driver`. You can read more about the examples [in the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_examples/readme.md).\r\n- Gazebo support was added for the Gen3 in the `kortex_gazebo` package. The package is **experimental** for now. You can see why, and how to start the Gazebo simulation [in the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_gazebo/readme.md).\r\n- MoveIt support was added for the Gen3 in the `kortex_move_it_config` package. You can read more about the MoveIt support [in the dedicated documentation](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/ros_kortex/blob/kinetic-devel/kortex_move_it_config/readme.md).\r\n"}
