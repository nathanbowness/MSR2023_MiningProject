# Redmine Elasticsearch Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Restream/redmine_elasticsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Restream/redmine_elasticsearch)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Restream/redmine_elasticsearch/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Restream/redmine_elasticsearch)

This plugin integrates the Elasticsearch<sup>Â®</sup> full-text search engine into Redmine.

Elasticsearch is a trademark of Elasticsearch BV, registered in the U.S. and in other countries.

## Compatibility

This plugin version is compatible only with Redmine 3.x and later.
All tests are performed with Elasticsearch 5 version. 
Work with other versions of Elasticsearch is possible but not guarantied.

## Installation

1. This plugin requires [Redmine Resque Plugin](https://github.com/Restream/redmine_resque). Install the plugin, but do not start a Resque worker for now.

2. Download and install [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/).

3. Install other required plugins:

    * [Morphological Analysis Plugin for ElasticSearch](https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-analysis-morphology)

    * [Mapper Attachments Type for Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments)

4. To install Redmine Elasticsearch Plugin,

    * Download the .ZIP archive, extract files and copy the plugin directory into #{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins.
    
    Or

    * Change you current directory to your Redmine root directory:  

            cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
            
      Copy the plugin from GitHub using the following commands:
      
            git clone https://github.com/Restream/redmine_elasticsearch.git plugins/redmine_elasticsearch

5. Install the required gems:

        bundle install

6. Reindex all documents using the following command:

        cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
        bundle exec rake redmine_elasticsearch:reindex_all RAILS_ENV=production

7. Start a Resque worker (as described in [Redmine Resque Plugin](https://github.com/Restream/redmine_resque) installation instructions).

        cd YOUR_REDMINE_ROOT
        bundle exec rake resque:work RAILS_ENV=production QUEUE=*

8. Restart Redmine

Now you should be able to see the plugin in **Administration > Plugins**. 

## Configuration

By default, only regular fields are indexed. To index custom fields, you should add them to **config/additional_environment.rb**. For example, to enable indexing of issue tags, add the following code:

    config.additional_index_properties = {
        issues:  {
            tags:  { type:  'string' }
        }
    }

For change connection options just add some to config/configuration.yml. Here an example:

    default:
      elasticsearch:
        log: true
        request_timeout: 180
        host: '127.0.0.1'
        port: 9200

[Full list of available options.](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/blob/master/elasticsearch-transport/lib/elasticsearch/transport/client.rb#L34)

## Usage

The plugin enables full-text search capabilities in Redmine.

Search is performed using a query string, which is parsed into a series of terms and operators. A term can be a single word (*another* or *issue*) or a phrase (*another issue*). Operators allow you to customize your search. 

For more information about the query string syntax, see [Elasticsearch Reference]( http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax).

The search results are counted and displayed according to the current user permissions.

You can search for one word by typing the word or its initial part in the **Search** box. If you type several words, the search results will show pages that contain at least one of these words. To search for all words, enable the **All words** check box. If you want to search for the exact phrase, surround it by double quotes (*"another issue"*).  
![search options](doc/elasticsearch_1.png)

By default, search is performed in the following fields:

* Subject or Title
* Description
* Custom fields values
* Notes (only for issues)

If you enable the **Search titles only** check box, search will be performed only in the **Subject** / **Title** field.

To perform search in other fields, you can specify the field name and its value in the query string in the following format: `field:value`.

The table below lists the fields that can be searched, and the corresponding Redmine field names. Alternative field names are preceded with a tilde ('~').

### Issues

| Query string field | Redmine field name |
|--------------------|------------------- |
| subject   ~ title | Subject |
| description | Description |
| author | Author |
| category | Category |
| created_on   ~ datetime | Created |
| updated_on | Updated |
| closed_on | Closed |
| due_date | Due date |
| assigned_to | Assignee |
| status | Status |
| priority | Priority |
| done_ratio | % Done |
| custom_field_values   ~ cfv | Custom fields |
| fixed_version   ~ version | Target version |
| is_private   ~ private | Private |
| is_closed   ~ closed | Issue closed |
| journals.notes | Notes |
| url | URL |

*Note that 'subject ~ title' means that you can use 'subject' or 'title' in a query*

For example this query will search issues with done_ratio from 0 to 50 and due_date before April 2015:

    done_ratio:[0 50] AND due_date:[* 2015-04]
