### LSST installation directions ###

If you have the LSST software stack available, you can simply build oorb as follows (after setting up the stack):

- clone this repository
- cd to the (new/cloned) directory, $OORB_DIR
- use eupspkg to build the entire package: 
 `eupspkg -v 1 -e prep`<br>
 `eupspkg -v 1 -e config`<br>
 `eupspkg -v 1 -e build`<br>
-  you can now eups declare and setup the package, as normal for a git version of an LSST software package.


### Without the LSST stack (original Oorb installation directions) ### 

OpenOrb (or OOrb), an open-source orbit-computation package.

# Introduction #

OOrb contains, e.g., the statistical orbital ranging method (hereafter
referred to as Ranging). Ranging is used to solve the orbital inverse
problem of computing non-Gaussian orbital-element probability density
functions (p.d.f.s) based on input astrometry.

Ranging is optimized for cases where the amount of astrometry is
scarce or spans a relatively short time span. Ranging-based methods
have successfully been applied to a variety of different topics such
as rigorous ephemeris prediction, orbital-element-distribution studies
for trans-neptunian objects, the computation of invariant collision
probabilities between NEOs and the Earth, detecting linkages between
astrometric asteroid observations within an apparition as well as
between apparitions, and in the rigorous analysis of the impact of
orbital arc-length and/or astrometric uncertainty on the uncertainty
of the resulting orbits.

In OOrb, tools for making ephemeris predictions and classification of
objects (i.e., NEO-MBO-TNO) are also available.


Documentation on usage and installation is available on the [oorb wiki](https://github.com/oorb/oorb/wiki).
