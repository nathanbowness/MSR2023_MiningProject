One change introduced a [new interface for the Error class](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/32313).\r\n\r\nWhile upgrading Cloud Controller VMs to this release, new jobs created by API servers containing the Rails 6 upgrade may serialize the new Errors interface in the database as part of jobs for the Worker VMs to pick up.  Worker VMs which have not upgraded, and are still running Cloud Controller with Rails 5, will fail to deserialize the Error class's new interface.\r\n\r\nWhile there is an existing mitigation in place, this mitigation may not be sufficient for large foundations which might still experience app push downtime as a result.  Please see cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng#2748 for more details\r\n\r\n\r\n### [CAPI Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/befce72e3dfc60c8fd4be5c4e08ff9b0b0af8ae8)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### [Cloud Controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/tree/1a30db3754d90694e40ec623f49814cc40877033)\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2652: Create wrappers for regexes instead of singleton methods\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2638: /v3/domains performance improvements\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2636: Do not delete bindings in case of bind errors during apply_manifest, treat failed key creation and failed bindings as non-existent\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2628: Remove errant experimental tags from v3 docs\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2598: Upgrade to rails 6.1\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2624: /v3/security_groups and /v3/space_quotas performance improvements\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/commit/bc031e21ee0be71b568516cfb7d4381865494de8: Improve error raised when service broker update fails sequel validation check\r\n- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/2581: Use subquery for window function (distinct queries)\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Controller Database Migrations\r\n\r\n- [20220111112500_drop_spaces_application_supporters_table.rb](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/blob/1a30db3754d90694e40ec623f49814cc40877033/db/migrations/20220111112500_drop_spaces_application_supporters_table.rb)\r\n\r\n#### Dependency Bumps\r\n- bump urijs from 1.19.6 to 1.19.7 in /docs/v3\r\n- bump path-parse from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 in /docs/v3\r\n- bump hosted-git-info from 2.8.8 to 2.8.9 in /docs/v3\r\n- bump sequel from 5.51.0 to 5.53.0\r\n- bump pg from 1.2.3 to 1.3.1\r\n- bump cf-uaa-lib from 3.14.3 to 4.0.1\r\n- bump sinatra from 2.0.8.1 to 2.1.0\r\n- bump i18n to version 1.9.1\r\n- bump newrelic_rpm from 8.2.0 to 8.4.0\r\n- bump fog-local from 0.6.0 to 0.8.0\r\n- bump multi_json from 1.12.2 to 1.15.0\r\n- bump nokogiri from 1.12.5 to 1.13.1\r\n- bump listen from 3.7.0 to 3.7.1\r\n- bump honeycomb-beeline from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1\r\n- bump oj from 3.13.10 to 3.13.11 (#2613)\r\n- bump google-protobuf from 3.17.3 to 3.19.2\r\n- bump spring from 3.1.1 to 4.0.0"}

Other databases and versions are not affected by application downtime, but may have other issues.  \r\n\r\n|Database|Issue|\r\n-|-\r\nMySQL 5.5 and earlier, MariaDB using InnoDB 5.5 | Application downtime.\r\nMySQL 5.6 or later, MariaDB using InnoDB/XtraDb 5.6 | No issues.\r\nPostgresSQL | **No** application downtime. In rare cases a deploy may fail, but succeed on a subsequent attempt. If subsequent attempts fail, follow the mitigation plan below.\r\n\r\n## Mitigation Plan\r\n\r\n### Mitigation for cf-release\r\nThere is a `cloud_controller_clock` job running on each of the `clock_z*` instances.\r\nIf the only jobs on a clock instance are `cloud_controller_clock`, `metron_agent`, `consul_agent`,\r\nand `system_localhost`, you can stop the entire instance with this command:\r\n\r\n`bosh stop -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME clock_z1`\r\n\r\nRepeat for each `clock_z*` instance.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, for each clock instance i, do the following:,\r\n\r\n```\r\nbosh ssh -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME clock_z[i]\r\nsudo\r\nmonit stop cloud_controller_clock\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade deployment has completed, bosh vms should report that all\r\n`clock_*` instances are running. If any aren't, bosh ssh to each non-running\r\n`clock_*` instance, `sudo`, and run `monit start cloud_controller_clock`.\r\n\r\n### Mitigation for cf-deployment\r\nThere is a `cloud_controller_clock` job on each of the `scheduler` instances. Unlike\r\nfor cf-release, there is only one option. The `cloud_controller_clock` job should be explicitly stopped\r\non each node as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbosh ssh -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME scheduler/i\r\nsudo\r\nmonit stop cloud_controller_clock\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade deployment has completed, bosh vms should report that all\r\n`scheduler` instances are running. If any aren't, `bosh ssh` to each non-running\r\n`scheduler` instance, `sudo`, and run `monit start cloud_controller_clock`.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n**Highlights**\r\n- Resolves an issue that causes tasks to sometimes be canceled prematurely or marked as failed after completing successfully.\r\n\r\n**CC API Version: 2.101.0 and [3.36.0](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.36.0/)**\r\n\r\n**Service Broker API Version: [2.13](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md)**\r\n\r\n### [CAPI Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/50e96e2eeedaedb865099a87fee30508c0a86265)\r\n- As an operator I can take a backup of only the relevant parts of the cc blobstore [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152718388)\r\n\r\n### [Cloud Controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/tree/c9e54f391005d3871e3b0c697ab03d40ca354e39)\r\n- A Cloud Foundry administrator should see a log when there is a discrepancy between Perm and CC [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153616329)\r\n- As an app dev (receiver), I can continue to bind apps to a service instance that has been shared with me when the feature flag is disabled [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153438338)\r\n- As an app dev (sharer), I can unshare a service instance from a space where I do not have access [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153244755)\r\n- As an app dev (sharer), I cannot rename a service instance that has been shared [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152109574)\r\n- As an app dev (sharer), I cannot share a service instance that is using an inactive plan [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150801609)\r\n- As an app dev (sharer), if I try to share a service instance into a space where access to that service is not enabled, the share fails [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150801606)\r\n- As an app dev (sharer), if the service instance sharing feature flag is disable, I should still be able to unshare existing shares [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150970623)\r\n- As an app dev I can filter v3 service instances by space guid [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152922808)\r\n- As an app dev, I can only see bindings in spaces that I have access to for shared service instances [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153456495)\r\n- Cloud Controller should check to see if a user can perform an action with Perm (V3) [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152564770)\r\n- Improve performance of GET /v2/service_instances [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152736102)\r\n- Permission denied while trying to V3 copy a droplet with NFS blobstore [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153418863)\r\n- Service instance sharing-related errors should usually return 422 instead of 400 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153176525)\r\n- V3 droplet/package/other blobstore resources downloads  don't work when using an NFS server [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153418205)\r\n- change tld to apps.internal [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/152251321)\r\n\r\n#### Pull Requests and Issues\r\n- cloudfoundry/capi-release #68: Update blobstore bbr scripts to only backup and restore the relevant parts of the cc blobstore [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153512163)\r\n- cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng #1028: Only show service bindings if requester has read access to bound app [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153592204)\r\n"}

These components are typically deployed with Diego and no change is required if using defaults. If not using defaults, we recommend changing these properties to `127.0.0.1` and an available port number: `capi.cc_uploader.debug_addr`, `capi.nsync.listener_debug_addr`, `capi.nsync.bulker_debug_addr`, `capi.stager.debug_addr`, and `capi.tps.listener.debug_addr`.\n- `dea_next.staging_disk_limit_mb` now defaults to 4096, down from 6144, although there was a long standing bug where Cloud Controller would ignore this configuration and always use 4096. We don't expect this to amount to any required change for operators. This property affects the staging disk limit for both DEA and Diego and can now be changed to an operators desired amount of disk for application staging.\n"}

This release should not be used, a fix is being worked on for CAPI 1.7.0.\n\n**CC API Version: ~~2.63.0~~**\n\n**Service Broker API Version: [2.10](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html)**\n\n# CCDB Migration for V3 API\n\nThis release includes a significant migration of the CCDB that is the first step to releasing the CC V3 API.\n\n**ALL EXPERIMENTAL V3 DATA WILL BE REMOVED WITH THIS MIGRATION**\n\nThe migration will cause temporary API downtime as Cloud Controller jobs that have not been updated will not be able to use the migrated database schema. Users will not be able to use the CC API to push apps, update apps or get app information, but it will not affect apps currently deployed to Cloud Foundry. \n\n## User Impact\n- Apps will continue to run normally.\n- The Cloud Controller API will be unavailable or raise errors during the deploy meaning users will be unable to push apps, update existing apps or get app information.\n- Crashing apps will not be restarted while the Cloud Controllers are being deployed.\n- App logs will not be aggregated to syslog drains while the Cloud Controllers are being deployed if the deployment takes longer than the  \u201c[properties.syslog_drain_binder.drain_url_ttl_seconds](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/develop/jobs/syslog_drain_binder/spec#L43-L45)\u201d manifest property. The default value for this property is 60 seconds.\n\n## Operator Procedure\n\nOperators are not required to do anything differently for this deploy, but due to the size of the migration, operators may wish to take some additional steps to minimize user facing errors.  See the Deployment Options below for information on steps an operator may take for this deployment.\n1. Ensure there is a current CCDB backup prior to deploying.\n2. Ensure there is adequate disk space available on the database server. This migration moves around significant amounts of data in the CCDB. The amount of disk space required will vary by RDBMS, it is recommended to err on the safe side.\n3. Alert consumers of the API that there is a maintenance period, specifically any GUI client may want to display a maintenance page.\n4. Consider temporarily increasing the value of \u201cproperties.syslog_drain_binder.drain_url_ttl_seconds\u201d to prevent app logs failing to propagate to syslog drains during the deploy.\n5. Select a deployment method from below and deploy.\n\n## Deployment Options\n\n### Deploy Normally\n\nThis is the simplest option. It should result in the shortest downtime period, but may be the most surprising to users as requests will appear to fail randomly as a result of a rolling deploy.\n\n#### Procedure\n1. Deploy the updated cf-release\n\n#### Impact\n- Users and clients will receive 500 errors from the API.\n- Cloud Foundry components continue to attempt to access the database resulting in errors until the deploy is completed.\n\n### Scale API jobs to zero instances\n\nThis option prevents access to CCDB by Cloud Foundry components that do not know the updated schema.  It also prevents clients from seeing seemingly random errors; they will only see unavailability errors.\n\n#### Procedure\n1. Prior to deploying the new cf-release, perform a manifest only deploy that scales down the following jobs\n   - api_z(x)\n   - api_worker_z(x)\n   - clock_global\n2. Deploy the updated cf-release with the original scale of the above jobs\n\n#### Impact\n- Cloud Foundry components will not attempt to access CCDB until they are able to complete requests.\n- Users and clients will get 404 errors instead of 500 errors\n- Requests will begin completing successfully when the first instances of the API server come up part way through the deploy\n- VMs will need to be created during the deploy which may be slow in some environments\n\n### Stop the API jobs\n\nThis option prevents access to CCDB by Cloud Foundry components that do not know the updated schema.  It also prevents clients from seeing seemingly random errors; they will only see unavailability errors.\n\n#### Procedure\n1. Prior to deploying the new cf-release, perform a `bosh stop` command on the following jobs.\n   - api_z(x)\n   - api_worker_z(x)\n   - clock_global\n2. Deploy the updated cf-release\n3. Perform a `bosh start` command on the jobs that were previously stopped.\n\n#### Impact\n- Cloud Foundry components will not attempt to access CCDB until they are able to complete requests.\n- Users and clients will get 404 errors instead of 500 errors\n- API requests will not be served until the entire deploy has completed and the API servers have been started.  This will create a larger maintenance window than the option to scale down instances.\n\n## Failing Deployment Procedure\n\nIn the event of a failing deployment related to this migration, operators will have to deploy the previously deployed version of CF Release and restore a CCDB backup. Other components using the database will need to be backed up and restored to roll back to a previously deployed CF release version.\n\n## Important Notes\n- V3 Service Bindings should be deleted before deploy as the V3 Service Bindings will be deleted without calling out to the broker.\n- V2 Apps keep an extra droplet when changing to the most recent droplet. The database record for this droplet will be removed during the migration. We intend to write a [background clean up job to remove orphaned blobs from the blobstore](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131456519) in the near future.\n- V2 Apps can no longer be moved between spaces.\n- V2 Apps can no longer be changed from buildpack to docker and vice versa.\n- V2 App usage events recently got \"previous\" entries for several fields. It is no longer possible to determine `previous_package_state` so this field has been deprecated.\n- V2 Apps running on Diego will now be tagged `APP/PROC/WEB/n` (where n is the instance number) in application logs sent to syslog drains.\n- V2 Apps that are staging during this deploy will likely fail without updating the app. The app should simply be restaged as it will be stuck in the `PENDING` package state.\n- V2 Apps using environment variables beginning with `CF_` will be in a bad state after the migration. We plan on [releasing a quick follow to fix this](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131334817).\n\n# <a name='job-spec-changes'></a>Job Spec Changes\n- `pending_packages.expiration_in_seconds` has been removed. pending packages will now be expired 5 minutes after the staging timeout.\n- `pending_packages.frequency_in_seconds` has been renamed to `pending_droplets.frequency_in_seconds`.\n- `capi.tps.traffic_controller_url` now [defaults to the internal traffic controller url](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129670351) instead of being dynamically configured to reach the traffic controller through the gorouter. Feel free to remove this from whatever deployment contains TPS (normally Diego deployment). There is an [upcoming story to do this automatically for those using the Diego manifest generation scripts](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130134865).\n\n### [CAPI Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/bd026a9b3c2b6d19d9a794c11cb07a5d7c05ea6e)\n- Jobs in CAPI release should use internal URL for traffic controller [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129670351)\n\n### [stager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stager/tree/ed7537d7f0dd4456a4fef2a2e5afb9ca36b47649)\n- As a BBS API client, I would like to observe that my LRP instances are not running or my Tasks have failed because there are no cells available matching those placement tags [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129370089)\n\n### [Cloud Controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/tree/5cfb5dac42c080d34420191c2ec04bfc765799e0)\n- CVE-2016-6658: As a CF operator, I expect buildpack urls to be stored and displayed with obfuscated credentials for Audit Events and App Usage Events.
