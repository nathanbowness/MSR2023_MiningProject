It is very experimental.\n\nUsername: debian\nPassword: temppwd\n\nTo use the image download compressed version below, then write it to a 1GB or larger microCD card using `dd if=Debian-USBProxy.img of=/dev/sdX`, where sdX is your microSD drive.\n\nTo boot from the image, insert the SD in to the BeagleBone Black, then hold down the boot select button (near the microSD slot) as you apply power to the device.  The BeagleBone Black will boot from the microSD and should bring up the Ethernet interface using DHCP.\n\nIf you would like to write the image to the on board storage you may use the automated copy script.  Connect the microSD card to your host system and change to the `BOOT` partition.  Then rename the flashing file: `mv flash-eMMC.txt.disabled flash-eMMC.txt`\n"}
