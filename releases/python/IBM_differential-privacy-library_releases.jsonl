Some changes break backward compatibility with previous versions of the library. This version of diffprivlib supports Python 3.5 through 3.8.\r\n\r\nThe updates are summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n# Added\r\n- `BudgetAccountant` class to keep track of privacy budget spent in a script (and associated [notebook](https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library/blob/master/notebooks/accountant.ipynb)).\r\n- `Budget` class to allow easy comparison (with `<`, `>`, etc) between privacy budgets of the form `(epsilon, delta)`.\r\n- `count_nonzero`, `sum` and `nansum` functions to calculate a differentially private count and sum on an array or list.\r\n- `GaussianDiscrete` mechanism, the discrete analogue to the Gaussian mechanism.\r\n- `clip_to_bounds` and `clip_to_norm` to clip input data to the given bounds/norm; used in tools and models as appropriate.\r\n- Notebook demonstrating [data exploration and visualisation](https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library/blob/master/notebooks/exploration.ipynb) capabilities.\r\n\r\n# Changed\r\n**Breaking:**\r\n- The form/syntax of the `bounds` parameter passed to tools and models has changed; it is now specified as a tuple of the form `(min, max)`. `min` and `max` can be scalars or 1-dimensional arrays.\r\nBounds can typically be converted to the new form with `new_bounds = ([l for l, _ in bounds], [u for _, u in bounds])`.\r\n- All functions (other than histogram functions) that previously required a `range` parameter now requires `bounds` instead (e.g. `models.LinearRegression`, `models.StandardScaler`, `tools.mean`, etc.).\r\n\r\n**Non-breaking:**\r\n- Diffprivlib now requires scikit-learn version 0.22 or later.\r\n- `Geometric` mechanism now has default `sensitivity=1`.This reflects the typical use of the geometric mechanism on count queries with sensitivity 1.\r\n- All mechanisms now support zero sensitivity.\r\n\r\n# Fixed\r\n- The publicly-exposed class counts in `models.GaussianNB` now satisfy differential privacy. The `class_count_` attribute is therefore noisy, and care must be taken in relying on these values for testing or other purposes.\r\n- `mean`, `std` and `var` tools, no longer require numpy array inputs, and can take all array-like inputs (e.g. scalars, lists and tuples).\r\n- Sensitivity calculation when randomising scalar-valued `var` output."}
