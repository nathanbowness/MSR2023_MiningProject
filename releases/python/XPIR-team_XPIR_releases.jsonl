These can still be used for example to do some tests on PIR without developping an application or to use the optimization process in order to get interesting cryptographic and PIR parameters for a given setting.\n\n**If you have compilation/execution issues, please let us know.** The old version is still available in the branch old-master and of course through previous releases. \n"}
