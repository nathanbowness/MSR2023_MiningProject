Most notably, it implements the arranger feature.\n\nImportant notes: \n- The arranger feature is constrained to loading songs located in the \"Prefs\" folder, which should be a fairly familiar concept to those who have worked on Mario Paint Composer 2.0. \n  - Songs can be located anywhere (a file chooser dialog allows one to save songs and load songs from anywhere). If they are used in an arrangement, they must be located in the \"Prefs\" folder to allow the arranger to load the songs properly.\n  - This \"Prefs\" folder functionality may be modified in the future.\n- Since this is a Beta release, expect bugs! Let me know if there are any bugs and their symptoms. Known bugs are detailed in the file named \"KNOWN BUGS.txt\"\n\nFeatures:\n- Arranger Mode\n- Updated graphics\n- Tested on Java 7 and Java 8, though the proportions on Java 8 are more close to the original intention.\n- Tested on Mac 10.9.5 & Windows 7 / 8.1\n- Imports Mario Paint Composer text files via loading.\n- Imports Mario Paint Composer arranger files via loading.\n- E + click = erase note\n- Shift + click on one of the instrument selection buttons turns the highlight green and therefore allows notes to be cut off manually using the \"note\" mute.\n- Shift + click = sharp\n- Alt + click or Ctrl + click = flat\n- Ctrl + Shift + click = double sharp\n- Ctrl + Alt + click = double flat\n\nStill working on:\n- Copy/paste/edit features (a la MPCTxtTools)\n- All of the other features listed in the Readme in the code section.\n- Save files in a human-readable format. \n"}
