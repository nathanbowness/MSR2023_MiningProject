Metavariables declared in the YAML header of a markdown page are now directly accessible by macros in the page, without needing to go through the `page.meta` object (e.g. if the meta-variable `foo`is declared in the YAML header, it can be accessible as `{{ foo }}` as well as `{{ page.meta.foo }}`. It makes using macros much simpler.\r\n\r\n1. The console messages of mkdocs-macros are now integrated with the standard logging of MkDocs. It means that you can both suppress them (`--quiet` option) or expand them to include debug messages (`--verbose`).\r\n\r\n2. Macros have their own trace function (`chatter()`) which writes into MkDocs' log as Info. If you are using the local server (`mkdocs serve`), you can toggle that trace on and off, with a `verbose` parameter in the plugin's configuration and this will be instantly reflected on the console.\r\n\r\n3. The Python module can use a new `on_post_build()` function, for actions that need to take place _after_ the HTML site directory is built (typically adding or modifying files). "}
