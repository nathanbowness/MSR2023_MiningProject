A major change is the modelling of wind farms where wake losses can be taken into account by a wind farm efficiency or by reducing wind speeds. Moreover, the option of modelling wind turbine clusters, including aggregated power curves, is useful for combined modelling of all wind turbines in a weather data grid cell. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of wind speeds can be considered by using the new power curve smoothing functionality. Apart from that, the windpowerlib is now connected to the OpenEnergy Database which provides it with power (coefficient) curves.\r\n\r\n#### ATTENTION: \r\nFrom v0.1.0 on power (coefficient) curves are provided by the OpenEnergy Database (oedb) instead of in csv files (v0.6.0 and lower) due to legal reasons. Use get_turbine_types() to check whether the turbine types you need are included in the database. If your turbine type is not included you can either use your own csv file or open an issue."}
