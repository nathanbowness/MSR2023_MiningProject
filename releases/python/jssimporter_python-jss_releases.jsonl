This is primarily to deal with the fact that Apple's shipped\r\n  OpenSSL is extremely out of date (requests uses pyopenssl, which uses the\r\n  out-of-date OpenSSL). Since current recommendations from Jamf are to run the\r\n  Casper server using only TLS1.2, this puts us in a bind. So, by default,\r\n  python-jss will now use curl for networking. Developers seeking the\r\n  advantages of using requests can replace the networking adapter they want to\r\n  use (see `jss.jamf_software_server.JSS`). *note:* because i added requests back in, this is less important - mosen.\r\n- @mosen really stepped up and provided Sphinx documentation! This is a great\r\n  motivator for getting some improved documentation going for this project.\r\n- `JSSObject` and all of its subclasses can now be used as a context manager\r\n  (the python `with` statement). All this does is automatically tries to save\r\n  the object automatically on the way out of the with context.\r\n- `Container.__contains__` magic method, which allows you to do things\r\n  like `if some_pkg in some_policy:`. Please note, this will find *any*\r\n  reference to that object contained within. This may not be what you want, for\r\n  example, if a computer is in a group's exclusions list but you want to know\r\n  if it's in the inclusion list. Thankfully, there's a method for that\r\n  (`JSSGroupObject.has_member()`).\r\n- `JSSObject` magic methods for equality and hash. This means you can\r\n  test whether two `Computer` objects are the same, for example. You can also\r\n  now use the objects as keys in a dictionary, or other mapping.\r\n- Implemented new endpoints and their corresponding objects:\r\n  `AllowedFileExtension`, `ComputerApplicationUsage`, `ComputerApplication`,\r\n  `ComputerHardwareSoftwareReport`, `ComputerManagement`, `HealthcareListener`,\r\n  `HealthcareListerRule`, `JSONWebTokenConfigurations`,\r\n  `InfrastructureManager`, `MobileDeviceHistory`, `Webhook`.\r\n- Added compression argument to `JSS.pickle_all()` (defaults to `True`) to\r\n  compress pickle output. A lot.\r\n- Tag access through the `.` operator for `JSSObject`s. For example, you can\r\n  now do `computer.configuration_profiles.size.text` to reach all the way down\r\n  the tree to that value.\r\n- All `JSSObject`s have a `tree()` method which will return a nicely indented\r\n  representation of the tag structure of the object. Use it like this: `print\r\n  a_computer_group.tree()`.\r\n- Automatic `match` search detection for object types that support it. Now you\r\n  can do `j.Computer(\"MacBook*\")` instead of `j.Computer(\"match=MacBook*\")`.\r\n  Match searches will _always_ return a QuerySet.\r\n- `JSS.version()` method now returns the server's version (using the jssuser\r\n  endpoint.\r\n- Made the `DistributionPoints` collection class iterable, so if you do need to\r\n  operate on individual DPs within, you don't need to fool around with the\r\n  private collection. (See JSSImporter for an example).\r\n- Added `Script.add_script()` to handle XML escaping and adding a script\r\n  payload to a `Script` object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Moved the `suppress_warnings` preference out of `JSS` and into the requests\r\n  adapter. The `JSS` initialization will accept that keyword argument to ease\r\n  the (sudden) deprecation, but it just won't do anything. Use the\r\n  `RequestsAdapter.suppress_warnings()` method if you need it.\r\n- Instantiating a `JSS` object will now default to using the `CurlAdapter` for\r\n  networking. Use `JSS.mount_networking_adapter()` to replace it with the\r\n  `RequestsAdapter` and gain things like sessions.\r\n- The requests library is now not a required dependency. You only need it if\r\n  you want to import/use the `RequestsAdapter`.\r\n- Through some metaprogramming shenanigans, jss.JSS is now about 500 lines\r\n  shorter, from dynamically creating all of the object search methods. This\r\n  makes maintenance of this code significantly easier.\r\n- All object search methods _accept_ keyword arguments (instead of a `subset`\r\n  positional argument). Whether the JSS is considered to work with subsetting\r\n  is recorded as a new attribute on the class (`jss.Computer.allowed_kwargs =\r\n  True` for example). This, again, makes it easier to maintain as JAMF adds or\r\n  removes query features. The search methods docstrings all reflect the level\r\n  of (considered) support.\r\n- `JSSObjectList` is now called a `QuerySet`, inspired by Django. The old\r\n  behavior was that the contents were just id/name for each contained object,\r\n  until you used the \"retrieve\" method. Now all objects contained within are\r\n  full JSSObjects.\r\n- python-jss was using `repr` and `str` too casually. Throughout, class' `repr`\r\n  has been rewritten to provide a very basic marker of the type, and `str` has\r\n  been written to provide the pretty-printing of XML functionality that it had\r\n  previously. In practice, this means that in the interpreter, developers will\r\n  have to `print x` instead of just entering `x` to see what they have.\r\n  However, it also means that simply doing `x` gives easier to read information\r\n  for QuerySets of items without dumping their entire contents to screen (e.g.\r\n  `j.Computer()` results in thousands of lines vomited into your terminal).\r\n- Renamed some internal classes (`JSSContainerObject` -> `Container`,\r\n  `JSSGroupObject` -> `Group`)\r\n- `Container` and all of its subclasses (most types of data from the JSS) now\r\n  use lazy-loading to defer sending a GET method until you actually need the\r\n  data.\r\n- All `Element` objects added to a `JSSObject` will get converted to the\r\n  `PrettyElement` type to enable dot access and pretty printing.\r\n- Renamed all of the request-failure exceptions by dropping the `JSS`:\r\n\t- `JSSGetError` -> `GetError`\r\n\t- `JSSPutError` -> `PutError`\r\n\t- `JSSPostError` -> `PostError`\r\n\t- `JSStDeleteError` -> `DeleteError`\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n- `JSSObjectList` has been renamed to QuerySet and now inherits from it. While\r\n  it is unlikely that any client code directly references this class, it is\r\n  worth checking for in your code. It will be remmoved entirely in a future\r\n  release. Please update code to use the QuerySet API and signature.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- All references to the `jss_migrated` preference has been removed. This is no\r\n  longer an issue with current and future JSS versions.\r\n- Scripts stopped being stored on distribution points with the conclusion\r\n  of version 8, so all distribution point code that did script copying,\r\n  deletion, existence testing, etc, has been removed.\r\n- `JSSObjectList.retrieve()` has been removed as it's no longer needed.\r\n- `JSSObjectList.pickle()` and `from_pickle()`. This code is just cruft; it's\r\n  just about the same amount of work to pickle it on your own.\r\n- `JSSObjectFactory` was removed as it is no longer needed. Client code should\r\n  use `getattr` if it needs to dynamically choose which class to use.\r\n- `JSSDeviceObject` was removed as it was no longer needed. It only added a\r\n  `udid` and `serial_number` method to two subclasses, `Computer` and\r\n  `MobileDevice`. You can access these through `.` notation now:\r\n  `computer.general.serial_number.text`\r\n- As a result of `.` access to subelements, all properties doing the same thing\r\n  have been removed. The vast majority of these were in `Policy` (e.g.\r\n  `a_policy.computers` is now accessed through `a_policy.scope.computers`).\r\n- Removed a bunch of spurious internal-use-only exceptions and used the builtin\r\n  ones that make more sense.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Made `JSS.user` and `JSS.password` proper properties, that will set the\r\n  attached network adapter appropriately.\r\n- Unicode and bytes usage throughout has been audited and fixed. For the most\r\n  part, developers can pass either to classes or methods and when they need to\r\n  get converted, python-jss will do the right thing.\r\n- Removed pretty-printing injection from `ElementTree`.\r\n"}

If you don't already have a plist file, on instantiation it will prompt your for all configuration information.\n- Added a `pre_callback` and `post_callback` parameter to `DistributionPoints.copy`. This allows you to provide some feedback for long copying operations. In the future, if desired, more may be added to long-running methods like `JSSObjectList.retrieve_all()`.\n- Added a LocalRepository repo type for paths either local or already mounted. Required connection args are \"mount_point\", \"share_name\", and if migrated, \"jss\".\n- Added some public methods to `JSSObjectFactory` if you're into doing some lower-level object searching and creation.\n\n### Changed\n- Optimized `JSSObjectList.retrieve_all`.\n- Reorganized `JSSObject.save` method. It was very convoluted. Now it reads better, is more error resistant, and should work exactly the same. Specifically, it assumes that if your JSSObject has no ID, then it is a new object (because only the JSS can assign one) and thus needs to PUT. If it _does_ have an ID, then it POSTs it. Potentially this could be an issue where if you retrieved an object, and then wanted to completely replace it with different data, and then tried to save, it would then be missing the ID and would PUT, creating a new object (or fail because of the name conflict); I don't see that as a real issue though.\n- Removed `JSSObject.search` since it implements a deprecated Element\n  method that wasn't being used anywhere.\n- Restored requests method of posting FileUploads. Now uses mimetypes to\n  detect file type and uses it in header.\n- JAMF fixed D-008180, where the JSS rejected Packages and policies with\n  a category of \"No Category Assigned\", even though that's what the JSS\n  supplied in GET requests. This was fixed in JSS v9.7. Therefore,\n  python-jss removed its overriden methods `Package.save` and\n  `Policy.save`. It's likely this was broader than just Packages and\n  Policies, but python-jss hadn't implemented or tested other objects.\n- Internal package structure drastically changed to make modules smaller and more manageable.\n- Improved the formatting of `JSSObjectList` objects.\n- Replaced the Element.**repr** method with the indenting pretty-printing one that has been in python-jss for awhile now. This allows all non-assigned results from Element subclass methods to pretty-print the XML.\n- Removed the recently added `JSSObject.pretty_find` as it's no longer needed.\n- Changed the method for creating \"new\" JSSObjects. Now, generating a blank XML for JSSObjects uses a class attribute `data_keys` to generate the structure. It allows for setting default values.\n  - Now, the `__init__` and `_new` methods accept any of the `data_keys` as keyword args to be set during creation.\n- Renamed `JSSObject.new` to `JSSObject._new` to discourage client use.\n\n### Fixed\n- `JSSObject.set_bool` improved to not have broken string behavior.\n"}

For example Computers allow you to do `jss_connection.Computer(None, \"basic\") for extended list information or`jss_connection.Computer(\"computer-name\", \"general&purchasing\")`or`jss_connection.Computer(\"computer-name\", [\"general\", \"purchasing\"])`for subsection retrieval. This should allow you to speed up big`retrieve_all` runs significantly.\n- Added Cloud Distribution Point support. Thanks to @beckf for packet analysis help, and @homebysix for testing. (#22)\n- Added `JSSObject.pretty_find`. Pretty prints sub-elements of a JSSObject for use in interactive exploration of the JSS.\n- Added option `verify` to `JSSPrefs` and the com.github.sheagcraig.python-jss preference domain. If not specified in the preferences, it will assume `True`.\n- Added property to `JSSGroupObject` and subclasses for `is_smart`. Now you can have a regular boolean property and setter for groups.\n- Added method `is_member` to `JSSGroupObject`. This allows you to test whether a Computer or MobileDevice object is a member of a group.\n\n### Changed\n- New mount technique uses PyObjC rather than subprocess to mount. Thanks to @pudquick for this slick implementation!\n  - Solves some Kerberos issues some users were experiencing.\n  - For OS X users who are not using the Apple Python, continue to use subprocess to mount.\n  - The nobrowse argument to mount is now deprecated, and will do nothing. It will be removed entirely in the future.\n  - Verbose prints mount arguments.\n- When viewing object data interactively, the `__repr__` now displays simply `*data*` instead of the full binary data for things like icons and app binaries.\n\n### Fixed\n- Encode data arguments to `JSS` object's get method.\n- Quote data arguments to `JSS` object's get method, since apparently requests doesn't do this for us.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed `JSSGroupObject.set_is_smart`. (Replaced with `@property`)\n"}
