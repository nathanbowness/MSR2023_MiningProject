Trade+ is a trading plugin for Spigot servers versions 1.7.10 and up. I opened sourced it because I didn't have a ton of time to work on it anymore, and I hope to let other developers contribute and make it better if they can find issues before I can :) 

If you feel like 'donating'/paying for it, you can do so on the SpigotMC resource page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/23138/

But if you want to download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/Trophonix/TradePlus/releases) that's totally fine too.

If you find bugs or want to add features, you are, of course, more than welcome to submit pull requests. Thanks!
