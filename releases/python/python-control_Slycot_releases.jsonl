This specific version of Slycot is based on SLICOT v5.8.\r\n\r\nSlycot itself remains GPL-licensed for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe minimum supported Python version is 3.7; support for Python 2, 3.5, and 3.6 has been dropped.  We have tested this release against Python versions 3.7 to 3.10.\r\n\r\nSlycot does *not* build against Numpy v1.23.0 due to numpy/numpy#21889; however, this is a build-time only bug which was fixed in NumPy v1.23.1, and Slycot v0.5.0 can be installed and used with any NumPy which supports the supported Python versions.\r\n\r\n# New features and updates\r\n\r\nWe've added a wrapper for SLICOT AB13MD (#171), which computes the upper bound for the structured singular value of a system and given uncertainty structure.\r\n\r\nSB03OD used to raise an error if the Schur factor supplied in array A was unstable; now, a warning is raised, and the eigenvalues are still returned (via #176, which updates to SLICOT v5.8). \r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\nMB03RD correctly handles X=None, the default (#139).\r\n\r\nIn SB03MD, the LDWORK value computed for discrete-time case was corrected (#166).\r\n\r\n# Build\r\n\r\nThere have been improvements and fixes to the setup.py, CMakeLists.txt, and MANIFEST.in.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nAG08BD testing was made more numerically robust.\r\n\r\nA test for XERBLA behaviour was fixed.\r\n\r\nIn continuous integration: \r\n\r\n  - we've moved from Travis CI to Github Action for continuous\r\n    integration (Github Actions added in #140, Travis CI removed in #150)\r\n\r\n  - we use pip for building, instead of invoking setup.py directly\r\n\r\n# Pull requests and issues associated with the release\r\n\r\nPRs merged: #135, #136, #139, #140, #141, #142, #145, #147, #149, #150, #151, #152, #158, #159, #160, #161, #166, #167, #171, #173, #174, #175, #176, #178\r\n\r\nIssues fixed: #134, #138, #95, #108, #137, #144, #146, #154, #123, #156, #157, #162, #155, #165, #46, #163, #172\r\n\r\nIssues closed (\"wont-fix\"): none\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n\r\nContributors to this release are:\r\n\r\n  - Art J.

Already present `sb10ad` searches for a minimum gamma value for a given H-infinity problem; sb10fd, by contrast, only attempts to solve for a given gamma value.  This can be used to test for admissible gamma values, which could be useful for problems like python-control/python-control#367.\r\n\r\n## New Slycot exception hierarchy\r\n\r\n@bnavigator, with support from @repagh, greatly improved Slycot error handling.\r\nSlycot routines now raise `SlycotValueError` where they would previously have raised `ValueError`, and `SlycotArithmeticError` where they would have raised `ArithmeticError`.  \r\nThese changes are backwardly compatible: `SlycotValueError` is a subclasss of `ValueError`, and `SlycotArithmeticError` is a subclass of `ArithmeticError`.\r\nAs part of this, many of the Slycot function docstrings were changed to conform to numpydoc conventions.\r\n\r\nThis supersedes an earlier fix for python-control#347 made during 0.4.0 development.\r\n\r\n##  Override XERBLA\r\n\r\nIn #128, with extra testing in #130, @bnavigator overrode the BLAS error function `XERBLA` that SLICOT routines use to report errors; the BLAS-provided `XERBLA` can terminate the whole Python process.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n## Correct application of DGEBAL in TB01TD and TB05AD\r\n\r\n@repagh fixed long-standing #11 with PR #122.\r\n\r\n## Fixed ab01nd for jobz='N' case\r\n\r\n@bnavigator contributed this fix in #129.\r\n\r\n# Build\r\n\r\nContributed by @bnavigator, @repagh, and @rabraker:\r\n\r\n - conda build recipes no longer use pip\r\n - added conda recipes for MKL and Apple\r\n - removed conda recipes for Windows; no developer is using them, and they weren't working\r\n - general simplifications and improvements of build\r\n - the signature files (`.pyf` files) are now a dependency of wrapper generation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nContributed by @bnavigator and @lytex:\r\n\r\n - Tests added for `mb05nd`, `mc01td`, `ab08nd`, `ab08nz`, `mb03vd`, `mb03vy`, `mb03wd`.\r\n - Tests fixed or expanded for `mb05md`, `sg03ad`, `td04ad`.\r\n - Switched to pytest; Slycot CI now uses pytest for both the Slycot and python-control test suites.\r\n - CI now builds and tests for Linux and macOS.  The Linux builds include OpenBLAS and MKL variants.\r\n - Examples are run as part of tests.  Outputs are not checked, but errors and warnings are.\r\n - CI coveralls.io integration fixed.\r\n - General test clean-up.\r\n - Test files are no longer executable.\r\n\r\n# Other changes\r\n\r\n@bnavigator contributed many other code improvements:\r\n\r\n - Fix for `mb05nd`.\r\n - Lots of clean-up: removal of unused mathematical.pyf, many docstring fixes, and some PEP 8 conformance changes to Python code.\r\n - Fix for Fortran-compiler dependence on machine value used to represent logical values `.TRUE.` and `.FALSE.`\r\n\r\n@repagh fired up his time machine and ensured punch-card compatibility of the SLICOT Fortran code by limiting line lengths to 72 characters.\r\n\r\n# Pull requests and issues associated with the release\r\n\r\nPRs merged: #71, #72, #75, #78, #91, #93, #79, #82, #83, #84, #87, #88, #96, #97, #101 , #103, #104, #105, #110, #114, #115, #116, #117, #118, #120, #121, #122, #124, #125, #128, #129, #130, #132, #133\r\nIssues fixed: #11, #76, #86, #44, #102, #106, #119, #126\r\nIssues closed (\"wont-fix\"): #46, #94, #99, #111\r\n"}
