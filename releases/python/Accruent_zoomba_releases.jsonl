This included:\r\n  * Adding a new persistent desktop background session to allow and speed up actions that need access to the desktop. Specifically the 'Select Element From List' keyword sometimes needs access to the desktop session in order to select an item. Having access to that on the fly allows this to happen seamlessly.\r\n    * A user can switch to this session as needed with *Switch Application | Desktop*\r\n  * Refactoring and improving the code to get closer to pure python performance. Through feedback and testing we found that the code was running much slower than pure python code. After some changes in how elements are found we are much closer now with about a 4% slower than python speed in an equivalent test.\r\n  * Deprecating the 'Click Text' and 'Mouse Over Text' keywords as they were 1. Just a shortcut for the 'Click Element' type keywords using the 'name' prefix and 2. They were horribly inefficient as they just used xpath. These keywords will be removed at a later date.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\ude80 Features\r\n\r\n* DesktopLibrary | Performance Improvements (#116) @Wolfe1\r\n* Desktop Library | select element from list (#114) @Wolfe1\r\n* Desktop Library | code and test refactor (#112) @Wolfe1\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\uddf0 Maintenance\r\n\r\n* Bump robotframework-appiumlibrary from 1.5.0.4 to 1.5.0.6 (#115) @dependabot-preview\r\n* Bump robotframework from 3.2 to 3.2.1 (#111) @dependabot-preview\r\n* Bump robotframework-requests from 0.6.6 to 0.7.0 (#110) @dependabot-preview\r\n* Bump robotframework-seleniumlibrary from 4.3.0 to 4.4.0 (#109) @dependabot-preview\r\n* Bump robotframework from 3.1.2 to 3.2 (#108) @dependabot-preview\r\n"}
