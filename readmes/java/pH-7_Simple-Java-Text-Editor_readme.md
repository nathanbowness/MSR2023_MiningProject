# Simple Java Text Editor

**PH NotePad** is a simple and light **text editor** (notepad) written in Java.

* Search tool (to search text/keywords easily in the code) + highlighting the code found.

* Find/Replace text/code.

* Auto completion for Java and C++ keywords (files need to be saved as *.java*/*.cpp*). It can be easily expanded to support pretty much any number of languages.

* Drag and Drop (drag files into the text area and they get loaded).

* Nice image buttons for better UX.

## DEMO

Download the Jar file and double click to run

Or run `java -jar SimpleJavaTextEditor.jar` from the command line

You can also generate easily a new jar file with the following command when you are in *src/* directory `jar cmvf ../manifest.mf ../SimpleJavaTextEditor.jar simplejavatexteditor/*.class`


### Important

**Icons directory and its files must be present on the path when running the application (so you will have to move "*icons/*" into "*src/*" directory)**
