It also has a new argument,\r\n  ``nr`` (defaults to 0), which can be used to specify the index of\r\n  the form to select if multiple forms match the selection criteria.\r\n\r\n* We now use requirement files. You can install the dependencies of\r\n  MechanicalSoup with e.g.::\r\n\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt -r tests/requirements.txt\r\n\r\n* The ``Form`` class was restructured and has a new API. The behavior of\r\n  existing code is unchanged, but a new collection of methods has been\r\n  added for clarity and consistency with the ``set`` method:\r\n\r\n  - ``set_input`` deprecates ``input``\r\n  - ``set_textarea`` deprecates ``textarea``\r\n  - ``set_select`` is new\r\n  - ``set_checkbox`` and ``set_radio`` together deprecate ``check``\r\n    (checkboxes are handled differently by default)\r\n\r\n* A new ``Form.print_summary`` method allows you to write\r\n  ``browser.get_current_form().print_summary()`` to get a summary of the\r\n  fields you need to fill-in (and which ones are already filled-in).\r\n\r\n* The ``Form`` class now supports selecting multiple options in\r\n  a ``<select multiple>`` element.\r\n\r\nBug fixes\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* Checking checkboxes with ``browser[\"name\"] = (\"val1\", \"val2\")`` now\r\n  unchecks all checkbox except the ones explicitly specified.\r\n\r\n* ``StatefulBrowser.submit_selected`` and ``StatefulBrowser.open`` now\r\n  reset __current_page to None when the result is not an HTML page.\r\n  This fixes a bug where __current_page was still the previous page.\r\n\r\n* We don't error out anymore when trying to uncheck a box which\r\n  doesn't have a ``checkbox`` attribute.\r\n\r\n* ``Form.new_control`` now correctly overrides existing elements.\r\n\r\nInternal changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* The testsuite has been further improved and reached 100% coverage.\r\n\r\n* Tests are now run against the local version of MechanicalSoup, not\r\n  against the installed version.\r\n\r\n* ``Browser.add_soup`` will now always attach a *soup*-attribute.\r\n  If the response is not text/html, then soup is set to None.\r\n\r\n* ``Form.set(force=True)`` creates an ``<input type=text ...>``\r\n  element instead of an ``<input type=input ...>``.\r\n"}
