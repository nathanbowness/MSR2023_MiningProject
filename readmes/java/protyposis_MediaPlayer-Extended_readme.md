MediaPlayer-Extended
====================

The MediaPlayer-Extended library is an API-compatible media player library for Android supporting
exact seeking to frames, playback speed adjustment, and DASH playback.
It strives to be a direct replacement for the Android `MediaPlayer` and `VideoView`
components and builds upon the Android `MediaExtractor` and `MediaCodec` API components.
It is very lightweight, easy to use, makes native code / NDK fiddling unnecessary, and works from Android 4.1 up.

A [demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.aau.itec.android.mediaplayerdemo) is available on the Google Play Store.


Features
--------

 * Direct replacement for Android components
 * Frame-exact seeking
 * Playback speed adjustment
 * Local files and network sources
 * Supports all Android [network protocols and media formats](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html)
 * DASH support
 * Lightweight (all components total to ~100kB)

For the GLES hardware accelerated view with zooming/panning, shader effects and frame grabbing, that
was part of this library until v3.x, please check [Spectaculum](https://github.com/protyposis/Spectaculum).

Usage
-----

Usage is very simple because the library's aim is to be API-compatible with the default Android classes.
The `MediaPlayer` in this library is the equivalent of Android's `MediaPlayer`, the `VideoView`
is the equivalent of Android's `VideoView`.

To migrate from the Android default classes to this library, just replace the imports in your Java headers. If
there are any methods missing, fill free to open an issue on the issue tracker or submit a pull request.

### API ###

This are the important additions to Android's default components:

| Method                       | MediaPlayer | VideoView | Description |
| ---------------------------- |:-----------:|:---------:| ----------- |
| `setDataSource(MediaSource)` | X           | X (setVideoSource) | Sets a `MediaSource` (e.g. `UriSource`, `FileSource`, `DashSource`), see description below. |
| `setSeekMode(SeekMode)`      | X           | X         | Sets the seek mode (e.g. FAST, EXACT, ..., see the `SeekMode` enum). Default mode is EXACT. |
| `getSeekMode()`              | X           | X         | Gets the current seek mode. |
| `setPlaybackSpeed(float)`    | X           | X         | Sets the playback speed factor (e.g. 1.0 is normal speed, 0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is double speed). Audio pitch changes with the speed factor. |
| `getPlaybackSpeed()`         | X           | X         | Gets the current playback speed factor. |
| `addCue(int, object?)`       | X           |           | Adds a cue to the playback timeline. Cues can be used to synchronize events to media playback, e.g. for subtitles, slides, lyrics, or ads. |
| `removeCue(cue)`             | X           |           | Removes a cue from the playback timeline. |
| `setOnCueListener(listener)` | X           |           | Listens to cues during playback. |


### MediaSource ###

This library adds additional methods to set the playback source, namely
`mediaPlayer.setDataSource(MediaSource source)` and `videoView.setVideoSource(MediaSource source)`.
These methods expect an instance of an object implementing the `MediaSource` interface. A few common
implementations are provided:

 * `UriSource` expects an URI to a file or online resource, and also accepts two URIs for separate
   audio and video resources.
 * `FileSource` expects a `File` instance (e.g. `new File(String pathToFile)`), or two instances to
   separate audio and video files.
 * `DashSource` (in the MediaPlayer-DASH module) expects an URI to an MPD file/resource, or a custom
   built or parsed `MPD` object instance, and an object implementing `AdaptationLogic` (e.g. one of
   the provided `ConstantPropertyBasedLogic` or `SimpleRateBasedAdaptationLogic`).

Additional media sources can be built by implementing the `MediaSource` interface. The advantage of this
interface is that it provides a way to implement data sources above the file level, and that it can
provide and sync multiple separate media sources to the same media player.

### Gradle ###

To use this library in your own project, you can either (1) fetch the modules from the
JCenter central Maven repository, or checkout the Git repository and (2) install the modules to
your local Maven repository or (3) include the required gradle modules directly.

#### JCenter repository ####

The [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) Maven repository contains release builds of the
library, usage is similar to any other Maven dependency:

    repositories {
        ...
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        ...
        compile 'net.protyposis.android.mediaplayer:mediaplayer:<version>'
        compile 'net.protyposis.android.mediaplayer:mediaplayer-dash:<version>'
    }

Run `gradlew publishMavenPublicationToMavenLocal` to compile and install the modules to your
local Maven repository.

### Modules ###

#### MediaPlayer ####

The base module provides the `MediaPlayer`, which can be used as a replacement for the Android
[MediaPlayer](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html), and the `VideoView`,
which can be used as a replacement for the Android [VideoView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView.html).
To load a video, use either the compatibility methods known from the Android API to specify a file or URI, or supply a `UriSource`.

#### MediaPlayer-DASH ####

Extends the MediaPlayer base with DASH support. To play a DASH stream, supply the MediaPlayer or VideoView a
`DashSource` with the URI of the MPD file or an externally parsed/constructed `MPD` object, and an
`AdaptationLogic`. MPDs can be externally parsed with the `DashParser`. This component comes with
two basic AdaptationLogic implementations, `ConstantPropertyBasedLogic` which selects a specified
constant representation mode, and `SimpleRateBasedAdaptationLogic`, which monitors the bandwidth and
tries to choose the best representation accordingly. It supports MP4, fragmented MP4 and WebM
containers, with both file and byte-range requests. The DASH support does not cover the full standard,
but many common use cases. `DashSource` can also be configured with a custom `OkHttpClient` instance,
useful for HTTP request caching, cookie management, authentication, proxy settings, etc.

MediaPlayer-DASH has external dependencies on [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp),
[Okio](https://github.com/square/okio), and [ISO Parser](https://github.com/sannies/mp4parser).

Example:

```java
Uri uri = Uri.parse("http://server.com/path/stream.mpd");
MediaSource dashSource = new DashSource(context, uri, new SimpleRateBasedAdaptationLogic());
mediaPlayer.setDataSource(dashSource); // or: videoView.setVideoSource(dashSource);
```

#### MediaPlayerDemo ####

This module is a demo app that incorporates all the main functionality of the MediaPlayer modules
and serves as an example on how they can be used and extended. It is available for download as
[MediaPlayer-Extended Demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.aau.itec.android.mediaplayerdemo) on the Google Play Store.


Issues & Limitations
--------------------

* MediaPlayer-DASH: MPD parser is basic and only tested with the test MPDs listed below
* MediaPlayer-DASH: representation switching can result in a short lag (this only happens with mp4/avc videos because reinitializing Android's MediaCodec takes some time; a workaround would be to prepare a second codec with a second surface, and switch them at the right frame; webm works flawlessly)

### DASH ###

The DASH support in this library is currently limited to the most common use cases. It supports
video and audio, and switching between multiple representations thereof (bitrates and resolutions). Segments
must be divided into separate files or explicit byte ranges and defined in a SegmentTemplate or
SegmentList. The player can also display live streams (dynamic mode), but this is just a simple hack to
demonstrate the ability. An evaluation of the DASH-IF test vectors is [available here](DASH-IF-test-vectors.md).

Currently not supported are single-segment representations, audio-only MPDs, multiple periods (it only
plays back the first period), segment index box parsing (sidx), dynamic MPD updates, and encryption.
The supported codecs are limited by their support through the Android MediaCodec.

There are two main cases when DASH fails:

* At MPD parsing time, when the parser detects an unsupported feature and throws an exception, or when
it crashes because of unexpected data. This is indicated in the demo app by a red error message and greyed
out video view buttons.
* At video view / media player initialization time, because segments cannot be downloaded, the
MediaExtractor fails reading a stream (usually because of unsupported container features), or a stream
uses a codec not supported by Android's MediaCodec. The demo app indicates this by an error toast
message and disabled playback controls.
