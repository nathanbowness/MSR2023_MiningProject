This\r\nexpression contained an error so that only the beginning of the filename was\r\nmatched.\r\n\r\nThis release changes the behaviour of equality matches against regular\r\nexpressions so that the whole operand needs to match the pattern. An explicit\r\nend-of-line anchor ($) is no longer required. This is done to more closely\r\nmatch the reasonable expectations of users writing rules.\r\n\r\nUsers should also consider emptying the database of cached analysis results to\r\navoid any chance of reuse of results from previous successful attempts at\r\nevading analysis.\r\n\r\nWorkaround for environments that cannot update: Change the first statement of\r\nexpression.2 in section [expressions] of ruleset.conf from\r\n```\r\nsample.name_declared == /smime.p7[mcs]/\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nsample.name_declared == /smime.p7[mcs]$/\r\n```\r\nto accept only filenames exactly matching `smime.p7s`, `smime.p7m` or `smime.p7c`.\r\n\r\nThanks to @mardom1 and @sukram230799 for finding and reporting the issue.\r\n\r\nChanges from 2.0:\r\n- Breaking change / security content: Equality operators in expressions using\r\n  regexes do now need to match the whole string up to the end.\r\n- Fix cluster duplicate handler dying (#160)"}
