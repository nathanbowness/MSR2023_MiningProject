# Continual Learning
This is a PyTorch implementation of the continual learning experiments described in the following papers:
* Three scenarios for continual learning ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07734))
* Generative replay with feedback connections as a general strategy 
for continual learning ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10635))


## Requirements
The current version of the code has been tested with:
* `pytorch 1.1.0`
* `torchvision 0.2.2`


## Running the experiments
Individual experiments can be run with `main.py`. Main options are:
- `--experiment`: which task protocol? (`splitMNIST`|`permMNIST`)
- `--scenario`: according to which scenario? (`task`|`domain`|`class`)
- `--tasks`: how many tasks?

To run specific methods, use the following:
- Context-dependent-Gating (XdG): `./main.py --xdg=0.8`
- Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC): `./main.py --ewc --lambda=5000`
- Online EWC:  `./main.py --ewc --online --lambda=5000 --gamma=1`
- Synaptic Intelligence (SI): `./main.py --si --c=0.1`
- Learning without Forgetting (LwF): `./main.py --replay=current --distill`
- Generative Replay (GR): `./main.py --replay=generative`
- GR with distillation: `./main.py --replay=generative --distill`
- Replay-trough-Feedback (RtF): `./main.py --replay=generative --distill --feedback`
- Experience Replay (ER): `./main.py --replay=exemplars --budget=2000`
- Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM): `./main.py --replay=exemplars --agem --budget=2000`
- iCaRL: `./main.py --icarl --budget=2000`

For information on further options: `./main.py -h`.

The code in this repository only supports MNIST-based experiments. An extension to more challenging problems (e.g., with
natural images as inputs) can be found here: <https://github.com/GMvandeVen/brain-inspired-replay>.

## Running comparisons from the papers
#### "Three CL scenarios"-paper
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07734) describes three scenarios for continual learning (Task-IL, Domain-IL &
Class-IL) and provides an extensive comparion of recently proposed continual learning methods. It uses the permuted and
split MNIST task protocols, with both performed according to all three scenarios.

A comparison of all methods included in this paper can be run with `compare_all.py` (this script includes extra
methods and reports additional metrics compared to the paper). The comparison in Appendix B can be run with
`compare_taskID.py`, and Figure C.1 can be recreated with `compare_replay.py`.

#### "Replay-through-Feedback"-paper
The three continual learning scenarios were actually first identified in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10635),
after which this paper introduces the Replay-through-Feedback framework as a more efficent implementation of generative
replay. 

A comparison of all methods included in this paper can be run with
`compare_time.py`. This includes a comparison of the time these methods take to train (Figures 4 and 5).

Note that the results reported in this paper were obtained with
[this earlier version](https://github.com/GMvandeVen/continual-learning/tree/9c0ca78f43c29594b376ca59516031fcdaa5d7ba)
of the code. 


## On-the-fly plots during training
With this code it is possible to track progress during training with on-the-fly plots. This feature requires `visdom`, 
which can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install visdom
```
Before running the experiments, the visdom server should be started from the command line:
```bash
python -m visdom.server
```
The visdom server is now alive and can be accessed at `http://localhost:8097` in your browser (the plots will appear
there). The flag `--visdom` should then be added when calling `./main.py` to run the experiments with on-the-fly plots.

For more information on `visdom` see <https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom>.
