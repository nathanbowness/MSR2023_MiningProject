# Advanced Java Folding

[![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) [![Plugin version](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/9320-advanced-java-folding.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9320-advanced-java-folding)

Modern JVM languages such as Kotlin, Groovy, Scala and some others offer many language features that let you
write code in a more concise and expressive manner. These features include type inference, properties,
interpolated string, range and tuple literals, enhanced operators, clojures, implicits, smart casts and any more.

This plugin extends the IDE’s folding features to emulate some of these modern languages’ features helping
fight verbosity.
