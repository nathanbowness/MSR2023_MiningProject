Compared to the libraries made using the old `make_package`, the `sum_package`-derived libraries:\r\n  - automatically determine to which precision to evaluate each integral in a sum to achieve the overall targe precision in the fastest way possible;\r\n  - automatically adjust contour deformation parameters, so the users are not required to tweak `deformation_parameters_maximum` to avoid sign check errors.\r\n- `make_regions` function, performs expansion by regions on generic regulated integrals.\r\n- `loop_regions` function, performs expansion by regions on loop integrals.\r\n- `Coefficient` class, represents a rational function that can be passed to `sum_package`.\r\n- `series_to_ginac`, `series_to_sympy`, `series_to_mathematica`, and `series_to_maple` functions added to `pySecDec.integral_interface`, they convert the result returned by the python library to a format compatible with various CAS programs. See [issue #3](https://github.com/gudrunhe/secdec/issues/3).\r\n- `pylink_qmc_transforms` argument for `sum_package`, `make_package`, and `loop_package`, allows a list of QMC integral transforms that should be generated for the python library to be specified (e.g. `pylink_qmc_transforms=['korobov2x3','korobov4','sidi4']`). Default is now just `korobov3`.\r\n- `form_memory_use` argument for `make_package` and `loop_package`, the maximum memory use allowed by FORM.\r\n- `form_threads` argument for `make_package` and `loop_package`, the number of allowed TFORM threads.\r\n- `DEBUG=1` flag for C++ library, produces a library suitable for debuggers and applies AddressSanitizer.\r\n- Examples `easy_sum` and `yyyy1L`: demonstrates `sum_package` with generic integrals.\r\n- Example `yyyy1L`: demonstrates `sum_package` with loop integrals.\r\n- Example `make_regions_ebr`: demonstrates `make_regions`.\r\n- Examples `box1L_ebr`, `bubble1L_dotted_ebr`,  `bubble1L_ebr`, `bubble2L_largem_ebr`, `bubble2L_smallm_ebr`, `formfactor1L_ebr`, `make_regions_ebr`, and `triangle2L_ebr`: demonstrate `loop_regions`.\r\n- \"Getting Started\" sections for the documentation of `sum_package`, `make_regions`, and `loop_regions`.\r\n- Documentation for amplitude header.\r\n- [GiNaC](https://www.ginac.de/) 1.8.0 and [CLN](https://www.ginac.de/CLN/) 1.3.6 are now included in the distribution; libraries produced with `sum_package` depend on both.\r\n- All the user-facing functions and classes are now exported directly from the `pySecDec` module, and are accessible as `pySecDec.<name>`.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Installation is now performed via `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pySecDec`.\r\n- The C++ frontend has been partly rewritten, see the generated `integrate_<name>.cpp` for the new usage.\r\n- `make_package` and `loop_package` now default to using `sum_package` underneath, improving their performance and robustness.\r\n  - The old behaviour of `make_package` can still be obtained by calling `pySecDec.code_writer.make_package`.\r\n  - The old behaviour of `loop_package` can still be obtained by passing the argument `package_generator=pySecDec.code_writer.make_package` to the function.\r\n- Multiple CUDA architectures can now be specified when building the C++ library by setting the environment variable `SECDEC_WITH_CUDA_FLAGS` to `-gencode arch=compute_XX, code=sm_XX -gencode arch=compute_YY,code=sm_YY`. Please refer to the [CUDA NVCC documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/) for details of this syntax; the script `print-cuda-arch.sh` in `examples/easy` may be useful for determining your architecture.\r\n- `IntegralLibrary` supports evaluating weighted sums of integrals, extra optional arguments for controlling the evaluation have been added (see the [online documentation](https://secdec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/full_reference.html#pySecDec.integral_interface.IntegralLibrary) for details).\r\n- To save compilation time, not every QMC integral transform is compiled for the python interface by default. Pass the `pylink_qmc_transforms` argument to `*_package` when generating the library to enable additional transformations.\r\n- The [formset](https://github.com/tueda/formset) script is now used to tune the size of the FORM buffers to allow maximum resources without exceeding the user specified memory bound; the `form_memory_use` parameter to `*_package` sets the desired maximal memory usage.\r\n- The `WorkSpace` parameter of FORM is automatically increased during library compilation. Users are no longer required to manually adjust `form_work_space` to avoid FORM-related failures.\r\n- `make_package` uses less RAM.\r\n- Various optimisations when computing derivatives and Jacobians (should slightly improve generate performance).\r\n- Parallelisation in Makefile for C++ library improved.\r\n- Example `userdefined_cpp` made compatible with the new C++ backend.\r\n- [Cuba](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) was updated to 4.2.1 (28 Jun 2021).\r\n- [Qmc](https://github.com/mppmu/qmc) was updated to 1.0.6.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Python versions below 3.6 are no longer supported.\r\n- A C++14 compliant compiler is now required (previously C++11 was sufficient).\r\n- Example `easy_cuda` was removed: CUDA is now used by default when possible, so it is equivalent to the `easy` example.\r\n- Environment variable `SECDEC_CONTRIB` is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n- The `SECDEC_WITH_CUDA=sm_XX` environment variable has been deprecated, use `SECDEC_WITH_CUDA_FLAGS=-arch=sm_XX` instead.\r\n- The `requested_order=x` argument of `loop_package` is deprecated in favor of `requested_orders=[x]`.\r\n- The `regulator=x` argument of `LoopIntegralFromGraph` and `LoopIntegralFromPropagators` is deprecated in favor of `regulators=[x]`.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Polynomial to power 0 (`poly**0`) was not simplified to 1.\r\n- 1-loop tadpole with geometric decomposition.\r\n- Missing `if name == \"__main__\"` guards in some examples, required by `multiprocessing`."}
