When implementing other entities to the old system, I realized some design weaknesses and therefore decided to go for a more bukkit-like approach. Every entity now has an own interface instead of a class, which is then implemented by the version modules - similar to CraftBukkit. This might sound redundant, but I also did some reverse engineering and ported some features from new API versions to 1.8, so that you gain maximum flexibility in the development process. \r\n\r\nWhen implementing the entities, some util classes such as a Potion system were required, so a potion library has been added with the future option to create custom potion effects. It also allows Kelp developers to implement newer potion effects to older versions and use the levitation effect in 1.8 for example. But concrete implementations will follow in the future - currently, only the base mechanics for such a feature have been added. \r\n\r\nNext to that, there are some bug fixes and adjustments for things like the `ReflectionUtil`, etc. You can read all changes in the changelog for more detail.\r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage. There have been no performance tests with big amounts of players nor the API code is final. All features are only available in Minecraft 1.8.8 now. Please be patient or report bugs and issues for further improvement.\r\n\r\n"}

On the one hand, it encourages developers to split their complex commands into small and more readable pieces, but on the other hand, this quickly results in lots of tedious work when creating thousands of new classes and annotating them individually, ...\r\n\r\nSo @DSeeLP has come up with a new way of creating commands. The new command system has completely moved away from the \"bukkit-like\" approach to a more declarative approach also used by [Brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier). Brigadier is the command library written by Mojang and used natively in Minecraft 1.13+. When creating a command you are basically building up a tree of arguments and parameters, which can then be interpreted by a version module and converted to a bukkit command. \r\n\r\nThis system has lots of potential for future updates. You could for example unit-test simple command structures or implement simple tab-completion, etc. \r\n\r\nThe old command system won't be entirely deleted though to provide a more bukkit-like alternative for commands and avoid confusion among new developers or overcomplication for some use-cases.\r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage.

Especially when coding minigames, regions become important to protect certain areas or control player movement, which is why we added those essential features. You can create listeners for your regions that are triggered every time a player enters or exits a region. You can move and expand them as well execute basic contains() checks for example. As of now, there are two basic types of region: `EllipsoidRegion` and `CuboidRegion`. But it is planned to add more with future releases. Furthermore, this release adds a custom `Multimap` implementation with thread-safety. \r\n\r\nThe testing module has been given some new testing features, which are not fully implemented yet as the inventory library is still lacking some methods, which will be added in the next release, so stay tuned. \r\n\r\nYou can read all changes and new features in this [version's changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.3.2.md).\r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage.

In old API versions of spigot (1.15 or lower), you don't have features like PluginTickets that allow forcing to keep certain chunks loaded or a method emulating a bone meal application on a block. Kelp ports those features over to all versions. Furthermore, the work with neighbouring blocks and chunks has been improved by introducing new methods for facing and vector calculations. \r\n\r\nWith the new util classes your code becomes more readable: Instead of `createExplosion(location, 4F)`, you can now write `createExplosion(location, ExplosionPower.TNT)` for example. The location and world library has already been integrated into other Kelp features such as the NPC system or the KelpPlayer/KelpEntity or the Particle Library.\r\n\r\nYou can read all changes and new features in [this version's changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.3.0.md). \r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage.

Until now there were no possibilities to extend the functionality of an NPC for example. You could create them, assign a few properties and let them stand stupidly in your world. This update allows you to really make them a part of your gameplay. By adding custom NPC activities such as walking you can integrate them into your city build or RPG storytelling and give the feeling of a more vital environment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some details such as changing the tab list name have changed. You now have more control over the individual properties of an NPC. This also includes that you can modify its equipment while it is spawned and so on. \r\n\r\nThere are also some minor changes that might break your current NPCs, so read [this version's changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.2.0.md) for more information. \r\n\r\nThere will be no `testing-module` shipped with this version as some more patches have to be made to create a fully-functional demo for NPCs. Please be patient here. But you can already try using the new NPC library with the information provided on the new [Wiki page](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/wiki/Creating-NPCs-with-Kelp). \r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage.

As reported in #33, the sidebar method being called on each title update caused weird and unexpected behaviour and might even lag out the server as database queries would be really unsafe there. \r\n\r\nSo this update focused on fixing this design issue by reworking the sidebar library. It now adopts the system of the inventory lib, while taking advantage of the component-based approach. This way, updates can now be handled via `stateful` and `stateless` components depending on the purpose. In addition, this update kind of points the future way of Kelp, which should be based more on static factory methods. In many cases, it becomes annoying to inject each dependency manually, which is why I tried to ditch dedicated factory classes for the sidebar system. This will be adopted to other parts of the framework with future updates.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are also some additional changes and minor bug fixes that shipped with this release, but you can check out the corresponding [changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.1.0.md) for more information.

There have been no performance tests with big amounts of players nor the API code is final. All features are only available in Minecraft 1.8 now.

We are happy to announce the brand-new release of kelp at the end of the year. We hope you have had a good & healthy year despite the given circumstances. The next release is going to come by the beginning of 2021 and will mainly focus on a rewrite of the sidebar system and some features related to that. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this release was to improve interaction opportunities with players and better integration of the `KelpPlayer` into your plugins. Therefore we have added\r\n* Different types of text prompts you can use to query input from players. If you need multiple lines of text you can use a Sign GUI, if you only need a single line or only a few words, you can rely on the anvil and chat prompt. \r\n* Methods of interactions with the chat by adding clickable and hoverable messages, called `InteractiveMessage`.  You can easily append multiple components per chat line with full support for color and style codes either with `ChatColor.COLOR` or the standard `\u00a7code` way.\r\n* Boss bars to give more variety for displaying information to your players\r\n* Some small bug fixes and code improvements in style and performance (including wider support for thread-safety)\r\n\r\nStill, we would like to point out that Kelp is not yet in a production-ready stage. There have been no performance tests with big amounts of players nor the API code is final. All features are only available in Minecraft 1.8 now. Please be patient or report bugs and issues for further improvement.\r\n\r\nFor a full and more detailed list of changes, head over to the [changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.0.5.md) for this release.

The new version of kelp has been in development for more than a month now, but there are some new exciting features to announce.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this update was to improve event handling and schedulers. Those two fields of plugin development are strongly related to each other, so I decided to put them into one release. \r\n\r\nFor the schedulers, the highlights are async scheduling utils and thread synchronization allowing to switch between the primary thread of the server and your scheduler threads. But there is also a wrapper for Bukkit's sync executors. The `Subscribes` annotation is a new and useful feature of the event handling system as you can put it above any method and this method is then executed every time the event is called. This allows you to still reuse your method as a normal method without having to pass an event parameter each time.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing around with the new features, the wiki will be updated within the next few days. \r\n\r\nFurther information about the new release can be found in the [new changelog](https://github.com/PXAV/kelp/blob/master/CHANGELOG/kelp-v0.0.4.md).
