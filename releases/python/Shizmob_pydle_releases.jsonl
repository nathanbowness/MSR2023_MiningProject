Currently restricted to low-level internals, user database, and WHOIS results.\n- Added WHOIS (`Client.whois(nick)`) and WHOWAS (`Client.whowas(nick)`) support.\n- Added `Client.set_topic(channel, topic=None)` and `Client.kick(channel, target, reason=None)` to API.\n- Added client-side ping timeout.\n- Added APIs for asynchronous operations such as `pydle.coroutine`, `pydle.parallel` and `pydle.Future`.\n- Added the ability to pass a PEM password for a TLS keyfile.\n- Added setting the source address to connect from.\n- Documentation! See http://pydle.readthedocs.org.\n\n## Changes\n- Moved to an asynchronous event loop system using [Tornado](https://github.com/facebook/tornado) as backend, refactored operations as a result of that.\n- Moved from homebrew log solution to Python's `logging` module.\n- Moved base RFC1459 IRC functionality to `pydle.features.rfc1459`.\n- Changed message system to add an IRC message class for extensibility and modifed raw callbacks to take them.\n- Grouped IRCv3.1 and IRCv3.2 features into `pydle.features.ircv3_1` and `pydle.features.ircv3_2`.\n- Changed setting `Client.nickname` to change nickname to `Client.set_nickname` API.\n- Changed `Client.mode(target, *modes)` to `Client.set_mode(target, *modes)`.\n- Made `Client.users` and `Client.channels` a normalizing dict, so that case does not mapper when looking up entries.\n- Made it always safe for features to call `super().on_raw_<command>(message)` in their command handlers.\n- Renamed the installed `irccat` utility to `pydle-irccat` to prevent name conflicts.\n- A whole slew of bugfixes and stability fixes!\n\n## Removals\n- Remove `STARTTLS` support for now due its lack of testing.\n"}
