This is the biggest and most important addition to the release which greatly increases the ergonomics of using monads in Ruby. Basically, almost everything it does is passing a block to a given method. You call `yield` on monads to extract the values. If any operation fails i.e. no value can be extracted, the whole computation is halted and the failing step becomes a result. With `Do` you don't need to chain monadic values with `fmap/bind` and block, everything can be done on a single level of indentation. Here is a more or less real-life example:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  class CreateUser\r\n    include Dry::Monads\r\n    include Dry::Monads::Do.for(:call)\r\n\r\n    attr_reader :user_repo\r\n\r\n    def initialize(:user_repo)\r\n      @user_repo = user_repo\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def call(params)\r\n      json = yield parse_json(params)\r\n      hash = yield validate(json)\r\n\r\n      user_repo.transaction do\r\n        user = yield create_user(hash[:user])\r\n        yield create_profile(user, hash[:profile])\r\n\r\n        Success(user)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    private\r\n\r\n    def parse_json(params)\r\n      Try[JSON::ParserError] {\r\n        JSON.parse(params)\r\n      }.to_result\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def validate(json)\r\n      UserSchema.(json).to_monad\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def create_user(user_data)\r\n      Try[Sequel::Error] { user_repo.create(user_data) }.to_result\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def create_profile(user, profile_data)\r\n      Try[Sequel::Error] {\r\n        user_repo.create_profile(user, profile_data)\r\n      }.to_result\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  In the code above any `yield` can potentially fail and return the failure reason as a result. In other words, `yield None` acts as `return None`. Internally, `Do` uses exceptions, not `return`, this is somewhat slower but allows to detect failed operations in DB-transactions and roll back the changes which far more useful than an unjustifiable speed boost (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n* The `Task` monad based on `Promise` from the [`concurrent-ruby` gem](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/). `Task` represents an asynchronous computation which _can be_ (doesn't have to!) run on a separated thread. `Promise` already offers a good API and implemented in a safe manner so `dry-monads` just adds a monad-compatible interface for it. Out of the box, `concurrent-ruby` has three types of executors for running blocks: `:io`, `:fast`, `:immediate`, check out [the docs](http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/root/Concurrent.html#executor-class_method) for details. You can provide your own executor if needed (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  include Dry::Monads::Task::Mixin\r\n\r\n  def call\r\n    name = Task { get_name_via_http }    # runs a request in the background\r\n    email = Task { get_email_via_http }  # runs another one request in the background\r\n\r\n    # to_result forces both computations/requests to complete by pausing current thread\r\n    # returns `Result::Success/Result::Failure`\r\n    name.bind { |n| email.fmap { |e| create(e, n) } }.to_result\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  `Task` works perfectly with `Do`\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  include Dry::Monads::Do.for(:call)\r\n\r\n  def call\r\n    name, email = yield Task { get_name_via_http }, Task { get_email_via_http }\r\n    Success(create(e, n))\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `Lazy` is a copy of `Task` that isn't run until you ask for the value _for the first time_. It is guaranteed the evaluation is run at most once as opposed to lazy assignment `||=` which isn't synchronized. `Lazy` is run on the same thread asking for the value (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n* Automatic type inference with `.typed` for lists was deprecated. Instead, typed list builders were added\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  list = List::Task[Task { get_name }, Task { get_email }]\r\n  list.traverse # => Task(List['John', 'john@doe.org'])\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The code above runs two tasks in parallel and automatically combines their results with `traverse` (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n* `Try` got a new call syntax supported in Ruby 2.5+\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    Try[ArgumentError, TypeError] { unsafe_operation }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Prior to 2.5, it wasn't possible to pass a block to `[]`.\r\n\r\n* The `Validated` \u201cmonad\u201d that represents a result of a validation. Suppose, you want to collect all the errors and return them at once. You can't have it with `Result` because when you `traverse` a `List` of `Result`s it returns the first value and this is the correct behavior from the theoretical point of view. `Validated`, in fact, doesn't have a monad instance but provides a useful variant of applicative which concatenates the errors.\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    include Dry::Monads\r\n    include Dry::Monads::Do.for(:call)\r\n\r\n    def call(input)\r\n      name, email = yield [\r\n        validate_name(input[:name]),\r\n        validate_email(input[:email])\r\n      ]\r\n\r\n      Success(create(name, email))\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # can return\r\n    # * Success(User(...))\r\n    # * Invalid(List[:invalid_name])\r\n    # * Invalid(List[:invalid_email])\r\n    # * Invalid(List[:invalid_name, :invalid_email])\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  In the example above an array of `Validated` values is implicitly coerced to `List::Validated`. It's supported because it's useful but don't forget it's all about types so don't mix different types of monads in a single array, the consequences are unclear. You always can be explicit with `List::Validated[validate_name(...), ...]`, choose what you like (flash-gordon).\r\n\r\n* `Failure`, `None`, and `Invalid` values now store the line where they were created. One of the biggest downsides of dealing with monadic code is lack of backtraces. If you have a long list of computations and one of them fails how do you know where did it actually happen? Say, you've got `None` and this tells you nothing about _what variable_ was assigned to `None`. It makes sense to use `Result` instead of `Maybe` and use distinct errors everywhere but it doesn't always look good and forces you to think more. TLDR; call `.trace` to get the line where a fail-case was constructed\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  Failure(:invalid_name).trace # => app/operations/create_user.rb:43\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `Dry::Monads::Unit` which can be used as a replacement for `Success(nil)` and in similar situations when you have side effects yet doesn't return anything meaningful as a result. There's also the `.discard` method for mapping any successful result (i.e. `Success(?)`, `Some(?)`, `Value(?)`, etc) to `Unit`.\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    # we're making an HTTP request but \"forget\" any successful result,\r\n    # we only care if the task was complete without an error\r\n    Task { do_http_request }.discard\r\n    # ... wait for the task to finish ...\r\n    # => Task(valut=Unit)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* `Either`, the former name of `Result`, is now deprecated\r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n* `Either#value` and `Maybe#value` were both droped, use `value_or` or `value!` when you :100: sure it's safe\r\n* `require 'dry/monads'` doesn't load all monads anymore, use `require 'dry/monads/all'` instead or cherry pick them with `require 'dry/monads/maybe'` etc (timriley)\r\n\r\n[Compare v0.4.0...v1.0.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-monads/compare/v0.4.0...v1.0.0)"}
