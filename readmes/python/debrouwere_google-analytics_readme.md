# Google Analytics for Python and the command-line

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics)

`google-analytics` takes the pain out of working with the Google Analytics reporting APIs. It supports both the Core and the Real Time API. It is written in Python but there's also a full-featured command-line interface.

* **Authentication.** OAuth2 is a bit of a pain and we've made it easier, both for interactive use and for [server applications][rauth]. We can also save your credentials in the operating system's keychain if you want to.
* **Querying.** Easier to query per week, month or year. Query using metric IDs or using their full names, whichever you think is nicer. Work with both the Core and the Real Time APIs.
* **Reporting.** Generate reports from the command-line. Optionally describe reports and queries in [easy-to-read and easy-to-write YAML files][yaml]. Reports in Python work better too: iterate through the entire report or column-per-column.
* **Exploration.** Traverse the account hierarchy from account to webproperty to profile to dimensions, both programmatically and with the included command-line interface.
* **Exports.** Clean JSON and CSV – as well as [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames – so you can analyze the data in anything from Excel to R.

This package is built on top of [Google's own API client for Python][apiclient].

## Quickstart

First, install the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/)

* Python 2: `pip install googleanalytics`
* Python 3: `pip3 install googleanalytics`

Then, create a new project in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com), enable the  Analytics API under "APIs & auth > APIs" and generate credentials for an installed application under "APIs & auth > Credentials". Keep this page open. For more detail, look at the [wiki page on authentication](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication).

After that, executing your first query is as easy as

```python
import googleanalytics as ga
accounts = ga.authenticate()
profile = accounts[0].webproperties[0].profile
pageviews = profile.core.query.metrics('pageviews').range('yesterday').value
print(pageviews)
```

Or on the command-line, that'd be:

```shell
googleanalytics --identity <identity> --account <account> --webproperty <webproperty> \
    query pageviews --start yesterday
```

The account, webproperty and profile determine what data you'll be querying. Learn more about profiles and querying on the [Querying](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Querying) wiki page, or alternatively look at the [Common Queries](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Common-Queries) page for lots of examples. Read more about how to work with the resulting data in [Working With Reports](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Working-With-Reports). [On The Command-Line](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/On-The-Command-Line) has more details about the command-line application.

The example above will authorize the app and authenticate you interactively. It is also possible to pass credentials
as arguments in Python, using environment variables or from your operating system's keychain. Authentication is treated in much more depth on the [authentication wiki page](https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication).
