It is also deployed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mplc/).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Multiple code refactorization: Refacto the multi-partner learning approaches in a more object oriented way. [#255](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/255)\r\n- New `Experiment` object: An object which runs and repeats several scenarios and gathers results to simplify their analysis. [#275](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/275)\r\n- New corruption methods and options: Refacto the corruption in a more object oriented way. Add `random`, `permutation`, `duplication`, `redundancy` ways to corrupt a dataset. [#280](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/280) & [#277](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/277)\r\n- Updated datasets integration: Change module architecture. The datasets are now a subclass of the `Dataset` class. [#262](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/262)\r\n- Updated tutorial notebooks. [#266](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/266)\r\n- Documentation: Update and format documentation. [#264](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/264) & [#294](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/294)\r\n- Add code coverage badge: A new badge on the README, to follow the extension of the test coverage. [#268](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/268)\r\n- More tests added: There is now end-to-end tests for contributivity methods and multi-partner learning approaches. [#304](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/304) &  [#300](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/300)\r\n- Add `FederatedGradient`: New multi-partner learning method. The gradients are aggregated (instead of the weights). Then the optimizer updates the model with the aggregated gradient. [#299](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/299)\r\n- Add S-model: New multi-partner learning method. It adds for each partner a NoiseAdaptative layer, which is supposed to adapt to potential label flip and thus improve the shared model performances, even with corrupted partners. \r\n[#281](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/281) & [#301](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/301)\r\n- Add local/global option for test and validation datasets. The dataset is split (only once! and in a stratified way) between train/test/validation datasets. If `\u2018local\u2019`, these test/validation datasets are splitted between partners, in the exact same way than the training one. [#288](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/288)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix bugs in corruption by permutation: A transposition was missing. [#284](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/284)\r\n- Update Cifar10 model optimizer: The learning rate was way too low. We also switched from RMSprop to Adam for the optimizer, as it showed better performances.  [#283](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/283)\r\n- Fix early stopping: Condition for early stopping was not reachable. [#279](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/279)\r\n- Logs: Add epoch number when showing evaluation metrics. [#274](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/274)\r\n- Dependencies updates: Removal of Keras (We now exclusively use the tensorflow's built-in Keras module), upgrade to Tensor Flow v2.4.0, Numpy v1.19.4, Scikit Learn v0.23.2, Pandas v1.1.5. [#290](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/290)\r\n- Switch to Github Actions instead of Travis for Continuous Integration. [#298](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/298)\r\n- Normalize contributivity scores in step-by-step methods. [#295](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/distributed-learning-contributivity/pull/295)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release received successful contributions from:\r\n\r\n- [bowni](https://github.com/bowni)\r\n- [arthurPignet](https://github.com/arthurPignet)\r\n- [RomainGoussault](https://github.com/RomainGoussault)\r\n- [Thomas-Galtier](https://github.com/Thomas-Galtier)\r\n- [celinejacques](https://github.com/celinejacques)\r\n- [natct10](https://github.com/natct10)\r\n- [jeromechambost](https://github.com/jeromechambost)\r\n- [JustineBoulant](https://github.com/JustineBoulant)\r\n- [Meylina](https://github.com/Meylina)\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
