This should ensure it continues to run smoothly on systems with fewer cores.\r\n\r\n- **Add prefetch, session, schema lock timeout options**\r\n  We added three new `GraknOptions`: `prefetch`, `session_idle_timeout_millis` and `schema_lock_acquire_timeout_millis`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n- **Fix test-deployment**\r\n  API changes broke test-deployment, so we updated it.\r\n\r\n- **On transaction failover, transfer options to the new session**\r\n  Previously, when opening a Transaction to Grakn Cluster failed (causing a new Session to be opened to a new server), the old Session options were discarded. Now, we properly transfer the Session-level options to the new session.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Refactors\r\n\r\n- **Shorten enum names to SessionType, TransactionType**\r\n  While aligning Client Python with Client Java, we introduced `GraknTransaction.Type` and `GraknSession.Type`. But in Python these proved cumbersome to type out. So we reverted them to `SessionType` and `TransactionType`.\r\n\r\n- **Architecture refactor**\r\n  We have refactored Client Python considerably to come up with an architecture that is easy to understand, easy to extend, and easy to replicate in other languages that wish to implement a Grakn Client.\r\n  This is a **breaking change**. The updated APIs are:\r\n\r\n#### Create a Grakn Core client\r\n```py\r\nclient = Grakn.core_client(address=\"localhost:1729\")\r\n```\r\n#### Create a Grakn Cluster client\r\n```py\r\nclient = Grakn.cluster_client(addresses=[\"127.0.0.1:11729:11730\", \"127.0.0.1:21729:21730\", \"127.0.0.1:31729:31730\"])\r\n```\r\n#### Retrieve a Type's Label as a string\r\n```py\r\nlabel = type.get_label().name()\r\n```\r\n#### Retrieve answer of Graql Match Aggregate query\r\n```py\r\ncount = tx.query().match_aggregate(query).get()\r\n```\r\n#### Get all roles currently played by a Thing (was previously called `get_plays`)\r\n```py\r\nroleTypes = thing.as_remote(tx).get_playing()\r\n```\r\nFor full details of this rework, please see https://github.com/graknlabs/client-java/pull/302 .\r\n\r\n## Other Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Upgrade grpcio to 1.36.1, protobuf to 3.15.5**\r\n  We upgraded grpcio and protobuf to remove warnings when running Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Please refer to [full release notes of 2.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/graknlabs/client-python/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha) to see the changes contained in 2.0.0.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

The database name, server address, primary/secondary state, and term number are all available.\n  This is a **breaking change**. `client.databases().all()` now returns `List[Database]` (previously it was `List[str]`).

We updated them to the new syntax: `if client.databases().contains(\"grakn\")`.\n\n- **Raise StopIteration when iterating over an already-completed Stream**\n  Previously, iterating over an already-completed Stream would stall.

Using the test, we improved our failover algorithm, fixing bugs and making it more readable.\r\n\r\n- **Grakn Cluster integration**\r\n  We now support connecting to Grakn Cluster.\r\n  This is a **breaking change.** Creating a `GraknClient` now requires a new syntax:\r\n  ```\r\n  client = GraknClient.core(address)\r\n  ```\r\n  To connect to Grakn Cluster, use\r\n  ```\r\n  client = GraknClient.cluster(address)\r\n  ```\r\n  The API usage of a Cluster client is the same as for a Core client. It also supports one additional field in `GraknOptions` named `allow_secondary_replica`, which when set to `True` allows **read** transactions to read from secondary database replicas.\r\n\r\n- **Add ability to retrieve all rules**\r\n  Since Rule was refactored in Grakn 2.0 to no longer be a subtype of Concept, we lost the ability to retrieve all rules using `match $x sub rule; get;`.\r\n  So, to allow the user to retrieve all rules, we now add `get_rules` to the `LogicManager`, enabling use of `tx().logic().get_rules()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n- **Fix 5 second delay before programs using the client actually terminate**\r\n  There was a 5 second delay before programs using Client Python actually terminated, caused by a worker thread staying alive for 5 seconds after closing a Session. We changed the thread to a daemon thread, that does not block the program's termination.\r\n\r\n- **Make private concept API method public**\r\n  We fixed the issue with `get_thing_type` API not being available for the user. \r\n\r\n- **Make behaviour tests rerunnable on developer's machine**\r\n  Fix rerunning behavioural tests for second time on developers' machines\r\n\r\n- **Create one gRPC Channel per session and transaction**\r\n  We observed that when using 2 parallel threads to open a large number of transactions, response messages from the server would be intermittently dropped, leading to the client stalling. Creating a separate gRPC Channel for each transaction appears to solve the issue.\r\n\r\n- **Fix console warnings caused by out of date dependency**\r\n  Fix `WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred` warning caused by an out of date version of protobuf.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Refactors\r\n\r\n- **Remove dependency on six library**\r\n  As Grakn Client Python is a Python 3-only library, we no longer need to depend on `six` library (which is a compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python 3) and therefore it needs to be removed for better code maintainability and understandability.\r\n\r\n- **Update dependency on grakn-protocol**\r\n  Depend on Grakn Protocol package by the new name `grakn-protocol` (consistent across all platforms)\r\n  # What are the changes implemented in this PR?\r\n  graknlabs/protocol#106 renamed Protocol package deployed to PyPI to `grakn-protocol`. In this PR dependency is upgraded to latest `snapshot` version of `grakn-protocol`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Reenable remote build caching**\r\n  Speed up builds by utilizing remote caching provided by BuildBuddy.\r\n\r\n- **Upgrade grpcio to 1.35.0**\r\n  Our older version of grpcio was not being successfully installed on all systems. To mitigate these installation issues we upgraded to 1.35.0.\r\n\r\n- **Update dependencies and the version**\r\n  We have updated `grakn-protocol` to `2.0.0a6`. Additionally, we've updated the version to `2.0.0-alpha-6`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Please refer to [full release notes of 2.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/graknlabs/client-python/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha) to see the changes contained in 2.0.0.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

In order to get them to work in CI, we needed them to fetch, unzip and run Grakn in the background. So we implemented that and added the tests to CI.\n  We also didn't have an automated mechanism for verifying that our `pip` deployment produced a working Client Python artifact that could be used to make Graql queries, so we created `test-deployment-pip`.\n\n- **BDD: Graql Steps**\n  We had Connection and Concept BDD implementations, but Graql steps were still not implemented. We added support for them.\n\n- **Update automation.yml to include `behaviour` dependency**\n  Following https://github.com/graknlabs/client-python/pull/154 PR, dependency analysis showed that `behaviour` repo is not defined in dependencies of automation.yml\n\n- **Update automation.yml to include `release` dependency for `common`**\n  Re-add 'release' to 'common' dependency, since dependency-analysis is supporting tags now.\n\n- **Add more BDD infrastructure and support more features**\n  Our previous BDD infrastructure only supported a very limited set of features. We expanded it to include more features, such as the Concept API.\n\n- **Bump year in license headers to 2021**\n  License headers are currently out of date (2020) for a while. This PR replaces 2020 with 2021 across all the files.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Please refer to [full release notes of 2.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/graknlabs/client-python/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha) to see the changes contained in 2.0.0.**\n\n\n\n"}

We want the client application to leverage the server's asynchronous parallel computation to receive as many answers as possible, as soon as they are ready. However, we don't want the client application to be overwhelmed with server responses. So, we needed some form of *\"back-pressure\"*. However, to maintain maximum throughput, everything had to be non-blocking. Sounds familiar? Well, it's the *\"[reactive stream](https://www.reactive-streams.org)\"* problem.\r\n\r\nWe took inspiration from [Java Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) and [Akka Stream](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html), and built our own reactive stream over [GRPC](https://grpc.io), as lightweight as possible, with our unique optimisations. When an application sends a query from the client to the server, a (configurable) batch of asynchronously computed answers will immediately be streamed from the server to the client. This reduces network roundtrips and increases throughput. Once the first batch is consumed, the client will request another batch. We remove waiting time between the first and second batch, by predicting that duration and streaming back surplus answers for a period of that duration, at the end of every batch. This allows us to maintain a continuous stream of answers at maximum throughput, without overflowing the application.\r\n\r\nWe then hit the max limit of responses GRPC can send per second. So the last trick was to bundle multiple query answers into a single server RPC \"response\". The impact on query response time was negligible, but it dramatically increased answer throughput again.\r\n\r\nThe new client architecture and [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) definitions are also hugely simplified to ease the developers' effort to build their own client libraries.\r\n\r\n**Please refer to [full release notes of Grakn 2.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha) to see the changes in Grakn 2.0.0.**\r\n"}

For reference, the server will default to `infer = True`, `explain = True`, and `batch_size = 50`.\r\n  ** use `explain=true` if you want to retrieve explanations from your query ** This was introduced to ensure correct Explanations, without blowing up Transaction memory when not required.\r\n\r\n- **Add future-style get for explicit waiting and error handling.**\r\n  Since the introduction of asynchronous query processing, the error handling model has become less clear, as an error could be picked up on a line unrelated to its corresponding query. In order to allow clients to explicitly consume query completion, a `get()` method is added to the query result (iterator) which will block until the results are received, or throw an exception on error.\r\n  Clients looking to benefit from the asynchronous processing can continue without using the `get()` syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Add Explanation.get_rule().**\r\n  The `Rule` that corresponds to an explanation is now being returned in the protocol responses, but the python `Explanation` object does not record it. This PR records it if the rule is valid, else sets it to None.\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n- **Fix explanation throwing an exception.**\r\n  A bug was introduced with local concepts that made it impossible to fetch explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Refactors\r\n\r\n- **Remove implicit, rename date to datetime, rename datatype to valuetype.**\r\n  This Change synchronises with changes in Grakn Core (https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn/pull/5722) that remove implicit types, and also updates to no longer use `date`, but instead use `datetime` (including a protocol update). Finally, we also propagate the change from `datatype` to `valuetype.\r\n\r\n## Other Improvements\r\n"}

When requests are made, they are immediately sent to the server and at the same time, a \"response resolver\" is placed onto the \"resolver\" queue. The response resolver queue ensures that responses are handled in the order that the requests are sent, thus allowing multiple requests to be sent whilst the responses are still being resolved, which is what enables us to handle async correctly.\r\n  When attempting to retrieve a response, the GRPC stream is iterated and the responses are buffered into each resolver until the desired response is found and can be returned. This ensures that messages are not lost due to out-of-order iteration.\r\n\r\n- **Relax strict dependencies on external packages.**\r\n  Some of our users reported issues on external dependencies being too strict.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

This should alleviate slowdown problems caused by connecting to a remote Grakn instance. Iteration now follows a streaming principle and results are pre-filled with data the user would normally be expected to retrieve via the concept API.\r\n  The step to split local and remote concepts helps us move towards \"value\" results rather than results which need to embed the transaction they were retrieved with. The added requirement to convert these concepts back to remote concepts should also make it clear to the user which methods require additional RPCs (where it wasn't clear beforehand that ALL methods required additional RPCs).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Refactors\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Remove python 2 compatibility import imap.**\r\n  Fix an issue where a python 2 only import (`imap`) was being used when the client is meant to be python 3 compatible.\r\n"}

We have opted for nothing).\r\n  2. If you want to know what was deleted, this implies your behavior was a _retrieve_ followed by a _delete_. This retrieve should be performed explicltly by the user not implicitly by Grakn, ie. a `match...; get...;` followed by `delete` using Concept API, or using a separate `match...; delete;` query.\r\n  Also, new method `is_deleted()` exists on all `Concept` as part of the Concept API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n- **Refactor how version is provided to Python deployment rules.**\r\n  graknlabs/bazel-distribution#195 changed how version is provided to `assemble_pip`.
