VirtualFish is a Python [virtual environment][Virtualenv] manager for the [Fish shell][].

You can get started by [reading the documentation][Read The Docs]. (Itâ€™s quite shortâ€¦ Promise!)

You can also get help on [#virtualfish on OFTC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&channels=virtualfish) (`ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/#virtualfish`), the same network as the [Fish IRC channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&channels=fish).

VirtualFish is currently maintained by [Justin Mayer](https://justinmayer.com/), and was originally created by [Leigh Brenecki](https://leigh.net.au/).
