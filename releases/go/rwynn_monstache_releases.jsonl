Version 5 targets MongoDB 3.6+ and Elasticsearch 6+.  \r\n\r\n### Changes from previous versions\r\n\r\nSome of the previous monstache settings related to MongoDB have been removed in this version as they are now supported in the [driver connection string](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/blob/v1.0.0/x/network/connstring/connstring.go)\r\n\r\nMonstache now defaults to use change streams instead of tailing the oplog for changes.  Without any configuration monstache watches the entire MongoDB deployment.  You can specify specific namespaces to watch by setting the option `change-stream-namespaces` to an array of strings.\r\n\r\nThe interface for golang plugins has changed due to the switch to the new driver. Previously the API exposed\r\na `Session` field typed as a `*mgo.Session`.  Now that has been replaced with a `MongoClient` field which has the type `*mongo.Client`. See the MongoDB go driver [docs](https://godoc.org/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver) for details on how to use this client."}

Without any configuration monstache watches the entire MongoDB deployment.  You can specify specific namespaces to watch by setting the option `change-stream-namespaces` to an array of strings.\r\n\r\nThe interface for golang plugins has changed due to the switch to the new driver. Previously the API exposed\r\na `Session` field typed as a `*mgo.Session`.  Now that has been replaced with a `MongoClient` field which has the type `*mongo.Client`.

This will be fixed shortly in 3.13.2, but until then please build monstache v3 using `go get gopkg.in/rwynn/monstache.v3`.  This will pick up new version of a dependency to fix the issue***\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Performance and bug fixes in the gtm library"}

This means that, by default, monstache no longer stores routing metadata in the `monstache.meta` collection.  Instead, if custom routing is performed via scripts (changing parent, index, routing, etc. values), monstache will perform a **term search** by _id across all indexes to find and delete documents if they are deleted from MongoDB.  To revert to the previous strategy of saving routing info in `monstache.meta`, run monstache with the config option `delete-strategy` set to `1`.  To use a delete strategy of `ignore` set `delete-strategy` to `2`.  The ignore delete strategy just means that monstache will not attempt to sync individual documents deletes in MongoDB to Elasticsearch.\r\n* The previous deletion strategy, saving state to `monstache.meta`, was time and space intensive.  With the new strategy you will likely see better indexing performance if you have been using scripts to alter the `_meta_monstache` variable.    "}

This means that, by default, monstache no longer stores routing metadata in the `monstache.meta` collection.  Instead, if custom routing is performed via scripts (changing parent, index, routing, etc. values), monstache will perform a **term search** by _id across all indexes to find and delete documents if they are deleted from MongoDB.  To revert to the previous strategy of saving routing info in `monstache.meta`, run monstache with the config option `delete-strategy` set to `1`.  To use a delete strategy of `ignore` set `delete-strategy` to `2`.  The ignore delete strategy just means that monstache will not attempt to sync individual documents deletes in MongoDB to Elasticsearch.\r\n* The previous deletion strategy, saving state to `monstache.meta`, was time and space intensive.  With the new strategy you will likely see better indexing performance if you have been using scripts to alter the `_meta_monstache` variable.    \r\n"}

This release adds versions to deletes such that an [insert, delete] sequence that gets sent to Elasticsearch in 2 different requests (due to `elasticsearch-max-conns` > 1) cannot actually perform a [delete, insert] instead.  In this case the insert would now carry a version number < the delete version number and be rejected.    "}

With `elasticsearch-max-conns` set to greater than 1 you may get out of order index requests; however after this fix **each document is versioned** such that Elasticsearch will not replace a newer version with an older one.  The version of the document is the timestamp from the MongoDB oplog of when the change (insert, update) occurred.  Out of order indexing typically happens when both an insert and an update are queued for a bulk request at around the same time.  In this case, do to the way the bulk processor multiplexes requests onto multiple connections, the document may be received out of order. "}

Previously, each database\n  in mongodb was mapped to an index of the same name in elasticsearch.  This creates a problem because\n  mongodb document ids are only guaranteed unique at the collection level.  If there are 2 or more documents\n  in a mongodb database with the same id those documents were previously written to the same elasticsearch index.\n  This fix changes the default mapping such that the entire mongodb document namespace (database + collection)\n  is mapped to the destination index in elasticsearch.  This prevents the possibility of collisions within\n  an index. Since this change requires reindexing of previously indexed data using monstache, the version \n  number of monstache was bumped to 2.  This change also means that by default you will have an index in\n  elasticsearch for each mongodb collection instead of each mongod database.  So more indexes by default.\n  You still have control to override the default mapping.  See the docs for how to explicitly control the index\n  and type used for a particular mongodb namespace.\n- Bumps the go version to 1.7.3 \n\n###### md5\n\n`fe05e10227d4168d05055647551db5ed  monstache`\n\n###### sha256\n\n`9ef0077ce4d4fcbca54b3c23bfacca7932d9dee959b6ed0141c520f9ed9d7941  monstache`\n"}
