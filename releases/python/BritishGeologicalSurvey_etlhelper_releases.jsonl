As these are user-provided they were a potential route for SQL injection attacks.  An `ETLHelperBadIdentifierError` is raised on bad input.\r\n+ The `abort_etlhelper_threads()` function has been added.  When called, this raises an `ETLHelperAbort` exception at the end of the current chunk.  It can be used to cancel jobs that are running in threads, such as in GUI applications.  See [README.md](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper#aborting-running-jobs).\r\n+ `list_row_factory` and `tuple_row_factory` have been added.  Data can now be exported as all of the main Python container types e.g. namedtuple, dictionary, list and tuple.  Lists are mutable so are convenient to use with transform functions.  Tuples are fast to create and access.  See [README.md](https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper#row-factories)\r\n\r\n## Pull requests merged\r\n\r\n* Validate table identifiers by @volcan01010 in https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper/pull/134\r\n* Repo tweaks by @volcan01010 in https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper/pull/135\r\n* Add list and tuple row factories by @volcan01010 in https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper/pull/136\r\n* Abort function by @volcan01010 in https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper/pull/137\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper/compare/V0.13.0...v0.14.0", "mentions_count": 1}

Externally facing changes are:\r\n\r\n1. The Instant Client zip file is downloaded from the Oracle servers by default (previously it was only accessible to logged in users)\r\n2. The script writes a file that can run with the `source` command to add the drivers to LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n3. The client can now be installed and configured in one line: `source $(setup_oracle_client)`\r\n4. The `--zip_location` allows an alternative location (URL or file path) to be specified for the drivers\r\n5. The `--reinstall` flag allows reinstallation of an existing install\r\n6. The `-v` flag gives verbose output of install progress\r\n\r\nNote that in Dockerfiles, it is still necessary to manually set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH using the `ENV` command.\r\n\r\n#### rowfactory -> row_factory\r\n\r\n`namedtuple_rowfactory` and `dict_rowfactory` have been replaced with `namedtuple_row_factory` and `dict_row_factory`.  This makes `etlhelper` consistent with `row_factory` in other Python modules e.g. `sqlite3` in the standard library.\r\n\r\n#### executemany parameter order changed\r\n\r\nThe syntax for executemany has been changed from `executemany(query, rows, conn)` to `executemany(query, conn, rows)`.  This is consistent with the other ETL functions where `query` and `conn` are together.\r\n\r\n### Non-breaking changes\r\n\r\n+ Update README.  New text brings intended use cases and simple example closer to the top.\r\n+ DbParams class gets `MY_DB.connect()` syntax for creating databases.\r\n+ Add `paramstyle` attribute to DbHelper class.  This allows the required paramstyle to be displayed in error messages, giving users a clue if a syntax error is because they used `%s` instead of `:1` as a placeholder for parameter values.\r\n+ Add integration tests for MS SQL Server databases.  These run internally on the BGS CI system.\r\n+ The PostgreSQL DbHelper now catches `InterfaceError` and `InternalError` (thanks @rwolniak)"}
