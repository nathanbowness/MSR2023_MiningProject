It should be noted that as of v2.0.0, the default output format of the CLI utility is `json` rather than the old single-line output. All tools should adapt to this change if they parse standard output.\r\n\r\n  - Build: Add Windows and OS X testing to github workflow\r\n  - Improve documentation and type annotations.\r\n  - Drop `Python < 3.6` support and migrate to f-strings.\r\n  - Drop input type manipulation through `isinstance` checks. If the user does not obey\r\n    to the expected annotations, exceptions will be raised. Robustness attempts lead to\r\n    confusions and obfuscated score errors in the past (fixes #121)\r\n  - Use colored strings in tabular outputs (multi-system evaluation mode) through\r\n    the help of `colorama` package.\r\n  - tokenizers: Add caching to tokenizers which seem to speed up things a bit.\r\n  - `intl` tokenizer: Use `regex` module. Speed goes from ~4 seconds to ~0.6 seconds\r\n    for a particular test set evaluation. (fixes #46)\r\n  - Signature: Formatting changed (mostly to remove '+' separator as it was\r\n    interfering with chrF++). The field separator is now '|' and key values\r\n    are separated with ':' rather than '.'.\r\n  - Metrics: Scale all metrics into the [0, 100] range (fixes #140)\r\n  - BLEU: In case of no n-gram matches at all, skip smoothing and return 0.0 BLEU (fixes #141).\r\n  - BLEU: allow modifying max_ngram_order (fixes #156)\r\n  - CHRF: Added multi-reference support, verified the scores against chrF++.py, added test case.\r\n  - CHRF: Added chrF+ support through `word_order` argument. Added test cases against chrF++.py.\r\n    Exposed it through the CLI (--chrf-word-order) (fixes #124)\r\n  - CHRF: Add possibility to disable effective order smoothing (pass --chrf-eps-smoothing).\r\n    This way, the scores obtained are exactly the same as chrF++, Moses and NLTK implementations.\r\n    We keep the effective ordering as the default for compatibility, since this only\r\n    affects sentence-level scoring with very short sentences. (fixes #144)\r\n  - CLI: Allow modifying TER arguments through CLI. We still keep the TERCOM defaults.\r\n  - CLI: Prefix metric-specific arguments with --chrf and --ter. To maintain compatibility, BLEU argument names are kept the same.\r\n  - CLI: Added `--format/-f` flag. The single-system output mode is now `json` by default.\r\n    If you want to keep the old text format persistently, you can export `SACREBLEU_FORMAT=text` into your\r\n    shell.\r\n  - CLI: sacreBLEU now supports evaluating multiple systems for a given test set\r\n    in an efficient way. Through the use of `tabulate` package, the results are\r\n    nicely rendered into a plain text table, LaTeX, HTML or RST (cf. --format/-f argument).\r\n    The systems can be either given as a list of plain text files to `-i/--input` or\r\n    as a tab-separated single stream redirected into `STDIN`. In the former case,\r\n    the basenames of the files will be automatically used as system names.\r\n  - Statistical tests: sacreBLEU now supports confidence interval estimation\r\n    through bootstrap resampling for single-system evaluation (`--confidence` flag)\r\n    as well as paired bootstrap resampling (`--paired-bs`) and paired approximate\r\n    randomization tests (`--paired-ar`) when evaluating multiple systems (fixes #40 and fixes #78)."}
