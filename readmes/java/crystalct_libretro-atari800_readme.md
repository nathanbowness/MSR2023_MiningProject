This is an updated version of lr-atari800 to add in missing features.

1) full keyboard support including the SHIFT and CTRL keys, so you can type all the characters. Useful for adventure games, programming in BASIC, etc.

2) four controller support when the emulator is set to 400/800 (useful for games like M.U.L.E.) Note that only the 400/800 had four joystick ports. See http://www.atarimania.com/faq-atari-400-800-xl-xe-what-games-support-4-or-more-simultaneous-players_93.html for a list of games that support four controllers.
