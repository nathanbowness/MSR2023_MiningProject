Additions\r\n\r\n_(No new features)_\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Change the way the \"ignored\" status is aggregated for directories, so directories containing ignored files no longer look like the directory itself is ignored ([bd4f144](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/bd4f1448846d1f49f537ad12e2946e0e5280f163))\r\n- Change the icon for TeX files to a \"T\" ([e3e776a](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/e3e776a1fa6cb0949f4223e75f86ceff5b1ac075))\r\n- Display the classification character (such as `/` for directories) at the end of symlink targets ([dbd11d3](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/dbd11d38042284cc890fdd91760c2f93b65e8553))\r\n- Display more helpful error messages when a number in a command-line option or environment variable fails to be parsed ([550f2d2](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/550f2d29c2c4e7e1326df4cdcccb7d47d2e81cd5))\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix thousand separators not being displayed in file sizes ([7a4cde7](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/7a4cde75ebeb166edf4f026ef485f1c54b7375b8))\r\n- Fix `$EXA_GRID_ROWS` displaying the wrong size table in certain situations ([c729e22](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/c729e226da0a4696ccee47d62f6627a406d07f6f))\r\n- Fix month name not following locale when a file's date is in the current year ([3a8005c](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/3a8005c8404c28701f3c6cabf3883d2d946ff01f))\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks again to ariasuni.", "reactions": {"url":

It\u2019s being released to work around a bug in macOS Sierra.\r\n\r\nUsually when I do a release I go through the commit history, pick out anything that looks like it could be a bullet point in the release notes, look at the contributors and see who\u2019s there, then edit the website and upload \u2014 there are more features in here than just the openssl upgrade, and the work done so far is really deserving of a \u201cproper\u201d release, rather than just a beta.\r\n\r\nBut I don\u2019t even want to learn how little work I\u2019ve done on it in the past twelve months.\r\n\r\nI think I need to be honest with everyone here. My interest in exa is still there, and the list of features I\u2019d still like to add is as long as it\u2019s ever been, but my motivation is completely shot. Compared to even a year ago it\u2019s *plummeted*. Every day I go to work, bang out code on whatever it is I\u2019m doing, leave, arrive home, then do my best to *not do anything*, on the computer or off it. My life\u2019s going alright, I can still do things, I\u2019m able to do things, but I just... don\u2019t, and I wish I could give you a better reason than that. GitHub notifications were something I\u2019d deal with later that day, then next week, then whenever I\u2019d get around to it, and then routed into a folder in my inbox that I never actually checked, and then every day I\u2019d see that number and hope it didn\u2019t increase, and then I noticed that whenever it *did* increase I wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate on anything for another hour, so I just hid it, which hurt at first but at least gave me some time back. I\u2019d still commit from time to time, but not mention any of this because I didn\u2019t want to call attention to it, as though in time everyone would just forget. Whenever I saw a reply to the Sierra bug thread, I\u2019d log in, read it, start to worry that if I replied *now* then I\u2019d be admitting to everyone that I was still around and hadn\u2019t died or something and was instead just ignoring their comments, and *then* what would people think of me? I even got as far as navigating to \u201cDelete this repository\u201d before I had to push the computer away.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s one push that went correctly. It\u2019s obvious to say, but it\u2019s stupid to delete code that people are using, just because you didn\u2019t want to deal with the fact that you made a mistake.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to try something new: **switching exa to a routine 6-week release schedule**. The Rust has a release train that works over the same duration using multiple versions. I think exa (a hundredth its size) can do without *that* part, but the rest of it is good advice. Having an actual date for each one means I don\u2019t get a choice in releasing anything or not, which is an *incredible* motivator for actually doing it! I still have to put 0.5.0 out properly, but with luck, the second release (0.6.0, which would come out halfway through May) would be a lot less daunting than the first, the third less than the second, and it would plateau from there.\r\n\r\nThe root advice here is \u201cif you\u2019re having difficulty doing something, then do it more often, because it gets easier\u201d. I found actually releasing my software hard. I want it to be easier.\r\n\r\nI hope you all find this acceptable, and I apologise again for the massive commit lacuna."}

So this is a kind-of emergency release to allow everybody to use those features, even those using the released versions.\n\nThe downside of this is that I did mark some features as ones I wanted to complete before the v0.4.0 milestone. All that's happened is the version that they'll show up in has been renamed, but they're all still on my radar.\n\n## Additions\n- Add `--grid --long` view, which splits the _details_ into multiple columns ([090cebe](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/090cebe669ecb1875a0066b207e841caeb4f039d))\n- Allow `--tree` without `--long`, which displays a tree view without any details ([e1f4ea9](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/e1f4ea92151901d97bfe042564342bc62ef442e5))\n\n## Changes\n- DragonFlyBSD support ([9601884](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/96018841f64dd0a7d0da72e7d80a69192c76864f), [6317417](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/6317417a98405d682288bb8bb45dfc99dd260b8a))\n- Change symlink arrow to `->` from `=>` ([ebbac61](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/ebbac61c742aad0eb4e36ed25c7f7a2300106791))\n- Extended attributes are now displayed as child nodes ([eee49ec](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/eee49ece041e96673ce536fc1a4f5afb19d43ead))\n- Individual files are now queried in parallel ([fa51a87](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/fa51a877670da42d76e6cd82828d71938cbcd8ea))\n\n## Fixes\n- Fix bug where Git repos were _always_ queried, making exa very slow ([d547c3f](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/d547c3f5d788f202de353938eaaedbb67a3624df))\n- Fix bug where an extra newline was printed ([6cf9274](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/6cf9274828bfecb21cc70c6ecdef52681542a746))\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to mgee, mneumann, kbknapp, lilydjwg, petevine, rhysd, hoodie, and DavidJFelix for contributing!\n"}

This one fixes a few bugs, but most of the code changes have been maintenance: upgrading to the new standard filesystem library was a big step, and having dates in the right time zone is something I'm glad to have finally landed.\n\nBy the way, I've decided to hold off on version 1.0 until exa can compile with Rust Stable. There aren't many feature flags left, and most of the ones that are pertain to the new `std::fs` library that we _need_ to use. So exa will continue to require the nightly version for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Additions\n\n_None in this build._\n\n## Changes\n- Make the Git column optional, to improve performance on large repositories ([7dc3a02](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/7dc3a02185bbfbc1cdf3f148bcb76932a562d3df))\n- Stat files in parallel, for a nice speed boost! ([d2df70e](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/d2df70ef413477df7b7d2878c5edceb5800f8201))\n- Use the new Rust `fs` and `io` libraries ([ffcc6fa](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/ffcc6fa1793b9f92fda0f001de81230900560fac))\n- ANSI codes are now not displayed when output is not to a terminal ([36116a1](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/36116a142095d61ab7f601cb6efda03d2cb8d749))\n\n## Fixes\n- More options now require `--long` ([5d152db](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/5d152dbe158cd4ea7b777a8dda83fb7636819ba0) and [a4459da](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/a4459da6adbf31dcabfbcb5d165d8d9b42b6949d))\n- Timestamps are now in the user's correct time zone, rather than UTC ([cc1d6aa](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/cc1d6aa5f1620f8861951f7c0b9337e85463ca31))\n- Executable files are now highlighted in green ([b452967](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/b4529671b8cc2a975c01d6aedf647184a253071d))\n- Allow compilation without Git support ([5caa6dd](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/5caa6dd924cd6f0844f033bbd4b7000dd765037f))\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to byteprelude, killercup, e12e, tsurai, and mgee for contributing!

([a4e1719](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/a4e17193d990340b163efceff8eb5e513199d704))\n- Add extended attribute support. ([ce23c63](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/ce23c63d759e3f19f59c91ebaa776d5b7a8746ac))\n- Add `--level` option to limit depth of recursion and tree view.

([ff1f6d0](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/ff1f6d0087f6475474c77031ded85be9e35cebfa))\n- Add `--version` command.

([0082563](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/0082563e47bfdb7099011012e6243c24152df554))\n- Numerous small optimisations and fixes.\n\n## Fixes\n- Use the _width_ of the file name in the grid view, instead of its _length_. The width handles multibyte UTF-8 characters and filenames with combining diacritics correctly. ([43e8061](https://github.com/ogham/exa/commit/43e806199675ce7cb4fdf78b73a554e1d80c0149))\n- Fix getting Git status while in a subdirectory.
