This bug was fixed starting in commit 8d1197217859e80a224699a6891e90a8d70e7848.\n\nOn 6/11/2016 we became aware that there are small differences in the exact values between the bug-fixed version and the original version even though the Spearman correlations (and therefore quality of the model) remain the same.\n"}
