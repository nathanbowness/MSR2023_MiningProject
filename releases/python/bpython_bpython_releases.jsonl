Python 2.5\n  is not officially supported, but after few changes Michael introduced, he\n  says it's working fine.\n- FakeStream has flush(), so works correctly with\n  django.core.email.backends.console thanks to Marc Sibson (#259)\n- FakeStdin has fileno() (#232)\n- Changes to sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 are respected thanks to Michael Schulle (#267)\n- atexit registered functions run on exit (#258)\n- fixed an error on exit code when running a script with bpython script.py (#260)\n- setup.py extras are used to define dependencies for urwid and\n  curtsies frontends\n\nThere's a new frontend for bpython: bpython-curtsies. Curtsies is a terminal wrapper written to making native scrolling work in bpython. (#56, #245) Try bpython-curtsies for the bpython experience with a vanilla python layout. (demo: http://ballingt.com/assets/bpython-curtsies-scroll-demo-large.gif)\n\nThis curtsies frontend addresses some issues unfixed in bpython-cli, and has\na few extra features:\n- Editing full interpreter history in external editor with F7, which is rerun\n  as in rewind\n- A new interpreter is used for rewind, unless bpython-curtsies was started\n  with custom locals or in interactive mode (#71)\n- Ctrl-c behaves more like vanilla python (#177)\n- Completion still works if cursor at the end of the line (#147)\n- Movement keys meta-b, meta-f, and meta-backspace, ctrl-left and ctrl-right\n  are all honored (#246, #201)\n- Non-ascii characters work in the file save prompt (#236)\n- New --type / -t option to run the contents of a file as though they were\n  typed into the bpython-curtsies prompt\n\nA few things about bpython-curtsies are worse than regular bpython:\n- Bad things can happen when using several threads (#265)\n- output prints slowly (#262)\n- bpython-curtsies can't be backgrounded and resumed correctly (via ctrl-z,\n  fg) (#274)\n\nThere are two new options in the new [curtsies] section of the bpython config\n- list_above: whether completion window can cover text above the current line;\n  defaults to True\n- fill_terminal: whether bpython-curtsies should be fullscreen (like bpython);\n  defaults to False\n"}
