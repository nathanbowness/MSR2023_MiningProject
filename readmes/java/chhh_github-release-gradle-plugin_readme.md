### Adding as a dependency

[Gradle Plugin Page](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.breadmoirai.github-release)

Build script snippet for use in all Gradle versions:
```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.github.breadmoirai:github-release:2.2.9"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.github.breadmoirai.github-release"
```

Build script snippet for new, incubating, plugin mechanism introduced in Gradle 2.1:
```groovy
plugins {
  id "com.github.breadmoirai.github-release" version "2.2.9"
}
```

## Using this plugin

```groovy
githubRelease {
    token "your token"// This is your personal access token with Repo permissions
                        // You get this from your user settings > developer settings
                        // If this value is not set, a login dialog will prompt you for your credentials.
                        // 2fa is not supported
    owner "breadmoirai" // default is the last part of your group. Eg group: "com.github.breadmoirai" => owner: "breadmoirai"
    repo "github-release" // by default this is set to your project name
    tagName "v1.0.0" // by default this is set to "v${project.version}"
    targetCommitish "master" // by default this is set to "master"
    releaseName "v1.0.0" // Release title, by default this is the same as the tagName
    body "" // by default this is empty
    draft false // by default this is false
    prerelease false // by default this is false
    releaseAssets jar.destinationDir.listFiles // this points to which files you want to upload as assets with your release
    overwrite true // by default false; if set to true, will delete an existing release with the same tag and name
    apiEndpoint "https://api.github.com" // should only change for github enterprise users
}
```
For additional info on these fields please see the [Github API specification](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release).


### Additional Tips:

All properties except releaseAssets support using a closure to defer evaluation.
```groovy
body {
    //do something intensive
    return "wow"
}
```
#### Body Changelog
By default, we provide a changelog when the body is not set via git commands.
You can also customize it and or use it manually
```groovy
body changelog {
    currentCommit "HEAD"
    lastCommit "HEAD~10"
    options(["--format=oneline", "--abbrev-commit", "--max-count=50", "graph"])
}
```
```groovy
body { """\
# Info
...

## ChangeLog
${changelog().call().replace('\n', '\n* ')}
""" }
```


#### Token
You can store your token in a gradle.properties located in either `USER/.gradle` or in the project directory and then retrieve it with `getProperty('github.token')`

#### Release Assets
You can avoid removing irrelevant files from your selected directory each time you publish a release by using a filter. 
For Example 
```groovy
FilenameFilter filter = { dir, filename -> filename.contains(project.version) }
releaseAssets = jar.destinationDir.listFiles filter
```
