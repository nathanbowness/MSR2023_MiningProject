So it is much more efficient now.\r\n* Significantly improved performance. It's up to x3 times better under high loads and complex configs.\r\n* Re-worked the end-to-end testing system. It now supports much higher loads, has better visibility, more features, and is significantly more reliable. Also, we have improved and added testing in other places.\r\n* Multiple refactorings, fixes, improvements, cleanups."}
