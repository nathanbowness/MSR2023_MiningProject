### _The family tree_ ðŸŒ³ _in your pocket_ ðŸ“±

_Family Gem_ is an app for Android designed to manage family trees.<br>
Project started on beginning of 2018.
It's writen in java within Android Studio.<br>
The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the Gedcom standard, in the latest versions 5.5 and 5.5.1.<br>
It's strongly based on the java [Gedcom parser](https://github.com/FamilySearch/Gedcom) by Family Search.<br>
Author is Michele Salvador, an italian self-taught programmer and genealogy enthusiast.

With _Family Gem_ you can:
- Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
- Import an existing family tree through a Gedcom file and modify it as you want.
- Export the family tree you created (via Gedcom again) to import in every other genealogy program.

_Family Gem_ is completely free and open source.
