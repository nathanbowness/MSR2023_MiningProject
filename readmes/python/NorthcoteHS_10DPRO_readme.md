# 10DPRO: Year 9-10 Programming

Welcome to the Northcote High School Year 10 Programming repo! 

## Getting started

Navigate the folder structure above to find your current unit (e.g. `1_introToCoding` for Unit 1).
You can also find useful resources in `resources`.


We will start the year getting familiar with how to commit and use GitHub. This is a useful tool which is ubiquitous in the programming sector.

Check out `0_gettingStartedWithGit` to get started.
