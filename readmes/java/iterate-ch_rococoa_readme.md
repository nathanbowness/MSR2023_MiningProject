# ï£¿ Welcome to Rococoa

Rococoa is a generic Java binding to the Mac Objective-C object system. It 
allows the creation and use of Objective-C objects in Java, and the 
implementation of Objective-C interfaces in Java.

## Rococoa Acknowledgements
Rococoa owes much to the following people and organisations
  * [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) does all the heavy lifting of calling into Cocoa and marshaling parameters. Timothy Wall also added pass struct by value and other extension points to make our life simpler.
  * [Paul Loy](http://www.keteracel.com) was the alpha guinea-pig.
  * Simon Taylor, Gareth Sylvester-Bradley and Dion Crannitch for Objective-C help.
  * Richard Care, Matt Bowers, Andy Collins and Morgan David let it go.
  * [Apple Inc](http://www.apple.com) produced Quicktime, Java on Mac OS, the Cocoa-Java Bridge and Quicktime for Java, then killed at least 2 of them.
If you know Java and Cocoa your name could be on this list! [Get involved!](HelpWanted.md). This project is now maintained by [iterate GmbH](https://iterate.ch/).

## Usage
### Maven Artifacts (LGPL)
Maven artifacts are available in a repository hosted on Amazon S3.

- Use the following Maven configuration in your project POM to reference artifacts from Cyberduck
 ```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>maven.cyberduck.io-release</id>
        <url>http://repo.maven.cyberduck.io.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

- You will need to add the AWS Maven Wagon to your build using
```xml
<build>
    <extensions>
        <extension>
            <groupId>org.springframework.build</groupId>
            <artifactId>aws-maven</artifactId>
            <version>5.0.0.RELEASE</version>
        </extension>
    </extensions>
</build>
```

- Add the dependencies as follows
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.rococoa</groupId>
    <artifactId>rococoa-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.rococoa</groupId>
    <artifactId>librococoa</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
    <type>dylib</type>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Change History
### 0.9.1
* Support for Apple silicon
### 0.8.0
* Rewrite implementation of cstringPtrForSelector to be failsave using `CFStringGetMaximumSizeForEncoding`
### 0.7.0
### 0.5.0
### 0.3.0
* Functioning 64-bit (and hence Java 6) support
    thanks to Paul Loy for fixes and discussions, and Andy Thompson for NSInteger et al
* We should now correctly l small structs as return values, not just NSSize!
* Improved NSDictionary
* Support for JNA-3.0.4
### 0.2.0
* Much more rigorous memory management.
* Selectors are now cached on the Java side.
* Fixed problem #9 where we could only have one delegate or notification 
    thanks to Adrian Ross for diagnosis and fix.
* Much expanded set of parameter and return types for delegates and notifications
    thanks to Andy Thompson for suggestions and help.
* Fix defect #10 where delegates and notifications failed after the autorelease 
    pool is released. Now use Rococoa.proxy rather than wrap.
* Now use JNA-3.0.3 (NB slightly patched, please make sure that Rococoa precedes
    JNA in the classpath 

### 0.1.4
* Reworked CFString handling to use UTF-8 and hence support extended characters.
* Now support delegates and notifications, using Rococoa.wrap(Object)

### 0.1.3
* Now ship a Universal Binary dylib
	
### 0.1.2
* Added LGPL licence files and these release notes.

### 0.1.1
* Changes to allow the checked-out code to build.

### 0.1.0
* First published to dev.java.net.
