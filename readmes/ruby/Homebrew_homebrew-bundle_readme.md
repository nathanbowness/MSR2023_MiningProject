# Homebrew Bundle

Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store and Whalebrew.

## Requirements

[Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) (on macOS or [Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)) for installing dependencies.

[Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) is optional and used for installing Mac applications.

[mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) is optional and used for installing Mac App Store applications.

[Whalebrew](https://github.com/whalebrew/whalebrew) is optional and used for installing Whalebrew images.

## Installation

`brew bundle` is automatically installed when first run.

## Usage

See [the `brew bundle` section of the `brew generate-man-completions` output](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#bundle-subcommand) or `brew bundle --help`.

An example `Brewfile`:

```ruby
# 'brew tap'
tap "homebrew/cask"
# 'brew tap' with custom Git URL
tap "user/tap-repo", "https://user@bitbucket.org/user/homebrew-tap-repo.git"
# 'brew tap' with arguments
tap "user/tap-repo", "https://user@bitbucket.org/user/homebrew-tap-repo.git", force_auto_update: true

# set arguments for all 'brew install --cask' commands
cask_args appdir: "~/Applications", require_sha: true

# 'brew install'
brew "imagemagick"
# 'brew install --with-rmtp', 'brew services restart' on version changes
brew "denji/nginx/nginx-full", args: ["with-rmtp"], restart_service: :changed
# 'brew install', always 'brew services restart', 'brew link', 'brew unlink mysql' (if it is installed)
brew "mysql@5.6", restart_service: true, link: true, conflicts_with: ["mysql"]
# install only on specified OS
brew "gnupg" if OS.mac?
brew "glibc" if OS.linux?

# 'brew install --cask'
cask "google-chrome"
# 'brew install --cask --appdir=~/my-apps/Applications'
cask "firefox", args: { appdir: "~/my-apps/Applications" }
# always upgrade auto-updated or unversioned cask to latest version even if already installed
cask "opera", greedy: true
# 'brew install --cask' only if '/usr/libexec/java_home --failfast' fails
cask "java" unless system "/usr/libexec/java_home --failfast"

# 'mas install'
mas "1Password", id: 443987910

# 'whalebrew install'
whalebrew "whalebrew/wget"
```

## Note

Homebrew does not support installing specific versions of a library, only the most recent one, so there is no good mechanism for storing installed versions in a `.lock` file.

If your software needs specific versions then perhaps you'll want to look at using [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) to better match your development and production environments.

## Tests

Tests can be run with `bundle install && bundle exec rspec`.
