Removed unneeded deps, upgraded lib versions https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/392\r\n- fixes docs example https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/391\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- moves operator API objects into separate go package. It allows to use operator API without import whole operator package. https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/commit/9fec1898617ba9f73c6c6c78cdebc1535514e263\r\n- allows to set `rollingUpdateStrategy` for statefullsets. With optional `rollingUpdateStrategy: rollingUpdate` operator uses kubernetes controller-manager updates for statefulsets, instead of own implementation. Allows kubectl rollout restart command for deployments and statefulsets https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/389\r\n- allows to disable namespace label matcher for VMAlertmanager with global option `disableNamespaceMatcher` https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/390"}

`VMProbes`, now it supports relabeling for static targets https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/commit/b4db7d5128a22d4979d7284e15576322acbc9b4c\r\n- Fixes `VMStaticScrape` - adds `honorLabels`

if you are manually edited  `PVC` size. In common cases, it must be safe."}
