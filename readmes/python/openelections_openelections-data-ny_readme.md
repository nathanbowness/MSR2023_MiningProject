OpenElections Data NY
=====================

Pre-processed election results for New York. These CSV files are converted from [original source files](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-ny) from individual counties. You can see [county-specific inventories](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny/blob/master/county_matrix.csv) and refer to the below table for overall progress. Elections marked as `done` have all counties completed for that level. Those marked as `working` mean that at least one volunteer is working on this election, and this could be a good place to start if you're new. `Not started` means that this election is wide open and could use a volunteer.
