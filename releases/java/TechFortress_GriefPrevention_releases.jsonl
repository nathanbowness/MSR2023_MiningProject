The rescue task now functions in all worlds regardless of claim mode, should have no chance of causing a \"false rescue,\" and uses the new Entity#setPortalCooldown API, \n\n# so make sure you update spigot/paper/craftbukkit before you update GriefPrevention!\n- Implemented #11 - `/deleteclaim` restores nature in survival worlds, _if_ survival worlds are configured to restore after deletion. (Remember, `/deleteclaim` is an administrative command, and is not exactly the same as `/abandonclaim`)\n"}
