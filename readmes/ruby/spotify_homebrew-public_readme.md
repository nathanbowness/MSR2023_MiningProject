# Homebrew Spotify

These formulae provide software open-sourced by Spotify.


## How do I install these formulae?
Just `brew tap spotify/public` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from another tap, you can `brew install spotify/public/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

    brew install https://raw.github.com/spotify/homebrew-public/master/<formula>.rb
