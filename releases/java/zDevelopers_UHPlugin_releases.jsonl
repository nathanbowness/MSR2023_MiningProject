Now, the slow start is launched by `/uh start slow:true` and the game, after, with `/uh start` without complex and useless command.\n- The teleporter can now ignore the teams and teleport one player per spot even with teams.\n  Syntax is: `/uh start [slow:true] [ignoreTeams:true]`\n- Implemented killer rabbit spawn.\n- Rabbits can be replaced by killer rabbits, following a probability set in the config file.  \n  Randomly spawned killer rabbit can be renamed; the default name is the original in the first snapshots: \"The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog\".\n- Added a few options to the sidebar display.\n  - Option to display the player's team.\n  - Option to display the health of the players.\n  - Option to display the online status.\n  - Option to display only display the met teammates in the sidebar, i.e. the players who were at less than 10 blocks (by default) once.\n  - Option to display the player's kill count in the sidebar. The kill counter does not duplicate the kills, and a kill is removed when a player is resurrected.\n  - Option to display the border size in the sidebar.\n- Added options to display contextual players list headers & footers, with tags to insert special values like the current episode number, or translated texts like \u201c2 players\u201d.\n- The plugin can now control the world border (only for squared borders).\n- Added (planned, for some) border-related options to the config file.\n- Added automatic border shrinking (for both squared & circular borders) with automatic reduction over time.\n- Added a command (`/uh tpspawn <player> [force]`) to teleport a player to his registered spawn point. The command behaves like the `/uh tpback` one, with safe TP and `force` option if no safe spot is available.\n- Added a `/title` displayed when the game starts (enabled by default).\n- When an episode ends, a title is displayed containing the number of the new episode.\n- The winners are broadcasted through a `/title` when the game ends (or the finish sequence is summoned using `/uh finish`).\n- Added a tip mentioning the spawns generator command if the spawns count is too low, for administrators not aware of the spawns system.\n- Added vanilla spectator mode support, inside a structure allowing other spectators mode (e.g. from other plugins) to be easily added. The vanilla support is enabled if SpectatorPlus is not installed or compatible, there isn't an option in the config for that (useless, if you don't want SpectatorPlus, uninstall it). This said, such an option can be added if someone request it.\n- The initial grace period duration can be customized (with a minimum of 15 seconds, to avoid any problem related to the initial fall).\n- Added a configurable PvP-less period, disabled by default (i.e. PvP enabled when the grace period expires).\n- Added a message when the grace period ends (can be disabled).\n- Players with a sufficient permission (default, operators) can spy all the other team chats at the same time, receiving all the discussions, with `/uh team spy [player]` (a toggle).\n- Rules can be set in the config and broadcasted to the players when they join and/or when the game start. These can be displayed on request using `/uh rules [receiver]`.\n- Added a GUI to select the teams.\n- Teams can be created and renamed through the GUI. The teams banners can be customized using it, by placing an existing banner on the edition GUI.\n- The banner can be placed at the spawn point or given to the players when the game starts.\n- Added a `/uh team banner` command to set a team banner from the current in-hand banner. The command `/uh team bannerreset` resets the banner to the default one.\n- Added an option to add the banner on the shields when crafted.\n- Now using the `naturalRegeneration` game rule to cancel the regeneration. The natural regeneration can be enabled in the config, making this a Hunger Game-like plugin.\n- The players' inventories can be locked before the game (cleared, no actions possible...).\n- A team selector can be given to all players\u2014right-clicking it will open the teams selector GUI.\n- Unknown players can now transparently be added to teams or others: if this case happens, their UUID will be retrieved using the Mojang API and they will be loaded on-the-fly.\n- Added a command to load some players (`/uh loadplayers`) so they are listed in the GUIs (and can be added to teams, even if they have not connected to your server yet).\n- Added an option (enabled by default) to display the players teams in the action bar, before the game only. Nothing is displayed to players without team.\n- Added PVP support before game start.\n- Added starting cages with lots of options to configure the blocks used; these can be colored according to the team color (for some blocks). The cages sizes can be configured too.\n\n\u00a0\n\n#### Optimizations\n\n\u00a0\n- Command system's core has been redone for stability and maintenance purposes.\n- In slow mode, the players are now teleported player by player, instead of team by team.\n- Added a display name to the scoreboard teams, so they are nicely displayed in the vanilla spectators menu.\n- Added an option to display the progress of the slow teleportations.\n\n\u00a0\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n\u00a0\n- Random spawn generators is more resilient to weird terrains.\n"}

one](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/8c9a554864f55289dc66887588eb13447c6ec8cd).\n- Deaths are [highlighted in a `grep`-friendly way](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/b222ab7118b3f8e2726633c58f15284086620500), in the console. [Death message included.](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/d3307e63ddf7023e3b329f41897ee66c4d215cd1)\n- [The players are notified when they enter/leave a team.](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/9912676c5284dbb3c2b3bfab8638975d46644229)\n- You can now specify [the maximal size of a team](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/0652f81de1122e799983878acb97aea2bf6c8d49) in the configuration file.\n- The team names are [no longer limited to 16 characters](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/45e072e8f032804e1bd6efd2a2e137550d695304).\n- The `/uh team list` command now [displays the on/offline state of the players](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/94e4c62b2d75948c697c2df46fcf3884e3cbee8d).\n- The initial teleportation to the spawn point (when the game is not started) is now [safe](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/287ff2b77a848062525f29c6855d283d09351de6) and [can be disabled](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/4f5ca52f7dfbe79ba16f23c6c57f757c92632991).\n- You can now [add/remove health with `/uh heal[all] [player] \u00b1diff`](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/ec0c7a4add42c5395bcea8be95da7afd49bc7739) (ex `/uh heal AmauryPi +2`).\n- You can now [ask the spawn points generator to avoid water](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/commit/877f1d9fbbd75bf17779300ce65fa3d5008be464).\n- [Added timers](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/issues/30). You can use these to **create a countdown of any duration, at any time** (even when the game is not started).  \n  The countdowns are displayed in the scoreboard, except if you hide them with `/uh timers hide <name ...>`.  \n  You can create a timer, with `/uh timers add <duration> <name ...>`, and starts it after with `/uh timers start <name ...>`.  \n  The timers can be paused, and they follow the global freezes.  \n  API available for developers.\n- [Big improvements on the way spawn points are managed](https://github.com/AmauryCarrade/UHPlugin/issues/20).\n  - You use now `/uh spawns add` to add a spawn point, just like before.\n  - You can now **generate automagically a bunch of spawn points in the map**, following various shapes.  \n    The three currently available shapes are `random`, `grid` and `circular`.
