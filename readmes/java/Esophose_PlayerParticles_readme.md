# PlayerParticles

A Spigot particles plugin with more customizability than any other. Create particles around players 
or blocks with any particle effect in the game with a plethora of skillfully crafted styles.

### Wiki

### Server Compatibility 
This plugin is compatible with [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and any forks, I recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io/). 
Using CraftBukkit will not work. 
The versions of Minecraft that are currently supported are `1.7.10-1.19` and newer.

### Compilation

PlayerParticles uses Gradle to compile and build the plugin. Run `./gradlew build` in the project's root directory to build the jar.
The plugin jar will be located in `./build/libs` when finished.
