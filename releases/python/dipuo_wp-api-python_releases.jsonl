This change helps ensure that upload and download will more reliably complete successfully in the event of intermittent server-side throttling through the use of a back-off retry strategy. Note that this strategy is a best effort and will \"give up\" if the server continues to reject requests for an extended period of time, ultimately returning the error back to the user. In most cases, though, the retry strategy will work and allow for the operation to complete successfully.\r\n\r\n**Full pip release location**\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-datalake-store/0.0.8"}
