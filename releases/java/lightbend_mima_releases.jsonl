This problem is reported when a method's erased signature has remained the same, but its full type signature has changed. Such a change is not always binary incompatible, but typically worthwhile to manually investigate and explicitly confirm. You can exclude all such problems with a `ProblemFilters.exclude[IncompatibleSignatureProblem](\"*\")`.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a problem where `IncompatibleResultTypeProblem` instances were missed.
