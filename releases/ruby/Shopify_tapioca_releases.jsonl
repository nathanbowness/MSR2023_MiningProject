Towards that goal, the headline features added are:\r\n- Tapioca now automatically checks and corrects RBI strictness to work around mismatched method definitions. This allows you to not have to reach for `typed_overrides` manually.\r\n- Tapioca now requires gems from the `Gemfile` that are marked as `require: false` as well. This allows you to not have to add a lot of entries to the `require.rb` file manually.\r\n- Tapioca now generates a `sorbet/config` file which ignores `vendor/` directory.\r\n- Tapioca now generates the documentation of methods/constants in the generated RBI file by default.\r\n- Tapioca now allows you to check your shim RBI files against gem/DSL RBIs **and** Sorbet payload RBIs to find shim definitions that are no longer needed.\r\n- Tapioca now includes a prototype of the `annotate` command to fetch signature/type annotation RBI files from remote sources. This command is in its early stages and will be improved in future releases, but we would love to hear what you think about it.\r\n\r\nWe also have an updated README, a cute new logo and documentation for how to create your own DSL compilers. \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n### \u2728 Enhancements\r\n* Prototype: Add `annotations` command by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/930\r\n* Check generated RBI files for correctness by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/842\r\n* Make DSL generation also autocorrect the gems RBI strictnesses by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/837\r\n* Need less entries in `require.rb` by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/818\r\n* Set default if `factory` prop is set by @jeffcarbs in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/833\r\n* Add `tapioca/dsl` entrypoint for custom DSL compilers by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/844\r\n* Always ignore the `vendor/` directory form the sorbet/config by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/848\r\n* Check duplicates between shims and Sorbet's RBI payload by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/879\r\n* Fairer queueing for parallel workers in RBI generation by @egiurleo in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/889\r\n* Validate config values for arrays and hashes by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/898\r\n* More effectively determine method ownership for RBI generation by @egiurleo in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/896\r\n* Add descriptive message for unexpected DSL exceptions by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/913\r\n* Enable documentation generation by default by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/920\r\n* Add support for :oneof fields on protobuf messages by @andrewn617 in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/929\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\r\n* Explicitly load descendants patch in ActiveSupport by @KaanOzkan in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/924\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udee0 Other Changes\r\n* Improve README by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/917\r\n* Add README entry for creating custom DSL compilers by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/921\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @egiurleo made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/889\r\n* @andrewn617 made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/929\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0", "mentions_count": 6}

It includes some headline features, like Active Record relation generation and doing parallel RBI generation (which really helps with `--doc` mode). But it also includes some breaking changes, especially around Tapioca [configuration](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca#configuration).\r\n\r\nIf the addition of `ActiveRecordRelations` generator ends up creating too many errors in your code, you can always `--exclude ActiveRecordRelations` while migrating to this version and then clean up the errors later. The behaviour of other Active Record generators will change to reflect the fact that relations are not being generated.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udea7 Breaking Changes\r\n* Refactor config infrastructure to be integrated with Thor by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/659\r\n\r\n### \u2728 Enhancements\r\n* Parallelize the generation of RBI files by @vinistock in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/559\r\n* Handle `frozen_record` scopes by @vinistock in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/565\r\n* Add error message for missing `ActiveRecordAssociations` by @mutecipher in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/578\r\n* Add `MissingConstantError` messaging by @mutecipher in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/584\r\n* Merge generated RBIs with gem RBIs by @mojanjz in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/453\r\n* Add a command to clean shim files automatically by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/641\r\n* Add ActiveRecord relations generator by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/236\r\n* Allow DSL generators to change behaviour based on if `ActiveRecordRelations` is enabled or not by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/660\r\n* Make `init` create a skeleton Tapioca config by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/662\r\n* Add support for Rails generators by @michaelherold in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/605\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\r\n* Support `ActiveRecord::Enum` for abstract classes by @etiennebarrie in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/555\r\n* Fix eval'ed constants not being generated in gem RBI generation by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/589\r\n* Generate typed store accessors in their own module by @Morriar in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/587\r\n* Exclude anonymous or value constants from DSL generation by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/595\r\n* Sanitize type aliases by @vinistock in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/609\r\n* Fix support for abstract singleton class methods by @mutecipher in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/615\r\n* Remove stale gem rbis on generate by @vinistock in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/616\r\n* Compare modules by identity for `Tapioca::Compilers::Dsl::Base#processable_constants` by @etiennebarrie in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/627\r\n* Fix reflection target class existence check by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/634\r\n* Properly load reflections for namespaced `has_many` relations by @jflinter in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/637\r\n* Eager load constants registered for `autoload` after loading gems by @paracycle in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/639\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udee0 Other Changes\r\n* Move test helpers to `lib/tapioca` by @mutecipher in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/576\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @etiennebarrie made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/555\r\n* @ryanwilsonperkin made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/575\r\n* @jflinter made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/637\r\n* @michaelherold made their first contribution in https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/pull/605\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca/compare/v0.5.4...v0.6.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Shopify/tapioca/releases/55578981/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 9}

(#414)\r\n* Support for Ruby 2.4 and 2.5 have been dropped. If you still need to use Tapioca on these Ruby versions, you will have to continue using the 0.4.x versions. (#339, #351)\r\n* The API of DSL generators have changed slightly, so if you have custom DSL generators, you will need to upgrade them to the new syntax that uses the `RBI` gem instead of `Parlour`. (#388)\r\n* Our main branch has been renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\n## \ud83c\udd95 New Features\r\n* A new DSL generator for exposing nested `ActiveSupport::Concern` modules properly. (#360)\r\n* A new DSL generator for the `Config` gem. (#372)\r\n* A new DSL generator for `ActiveStorage`. (#416)\r\n* A new DSL generator for `ActiveModel::Attributes`. (#419)\r\n* A new DSL generator for `AASM`. (#463)\r\n* Better generation for `mixes_in_class_modules` on Sorbet versions that support multiple arguments to it. (#363)\r\n* DSL generators have built-in access to reflection helpers like `name_of`, `superclass_of`, etc and are advised to use them over calling the normal reflection methods. (#418, #481)\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\r\n* Compile generic types in signatures using the correct constant (#412)\r\n* Do not generate empty `ActiveJob` classes. (#345)\r\n* Never sort mixed in modules, since include/extend order is important. (#392, #405)\r\n* Properly root namespace `CollectionProxy` generic types. (#439) (thanks @fsateler)\r\n* Make Tapioca work with Bundler 2.22.25+ (#446, #460)\r\n* Tapioca no longer crashes if the target of helper method proxies do not exist. (#448)\r\n* Rename Tapioca::Gemfile::Gem constant to Tapioca::Gemfile::GemSpec to prevent confusion with top-level Gem constant in generate RBI file for Tapioca itself (#475)\r\n* Fix load ordering that would fail to autoload some constants from gems using Zeitwerk and implicit namespaces (#480)\r\n\r\n## \u2728Enhancements\r\n* Enchaned support for better `IdentityCache` RBI generation with cache aliases support. (#369)\r\n* If a job class has overridden Sidekiq methods, the `Sidekiq` generator does not generate them. (#482)\r\n* Added `--verify` flag to `tapioca sync/gem`. (#364) (thanks @jeffcarbs)\r\n* Added `--exclude-generators` flag to `tapioca dsl`. (#382) (thanks @jeffcarbs)\r\n* Added `--file-header` flag to all `tapioca` commands to turn on/off the generated file header comment. (#389)\r\n* Better file header comment for the `require.rb` generated by `tapioca require` command. (#344)\r\n* Add `--verbose` flag to `tapioca dsl` to output which constant is being processed. (#402)\r\n* Clean up flags to various `tapioca` commands. (#407)\r\n* DSL generators are always run in alphabetical order to ensure include/extends are deterministic.
