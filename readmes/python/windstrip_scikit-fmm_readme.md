# scikit-fmm: the fast marching method for Python

`scikit-fmm` is a Python extension module which implements the fast marching method.
The fast marching method is used to model the evolution of boundaries
and interfaces in a variety of application areas. More specifically,
the fast marching method is a numerical technique for finding
approximate solutions to boundary value problems of the Eikonal
equation:

F(x) | grad T(x) | = 1

Typically, such a problem describes the evolution of a closed curve as
a function of time T with speed F(x)>0 in the normal direction at a
point x on the curve. The speed function is specified, and the time at
which the contour crosses a point x is obtained by solving the
equation.

scikit-fmm is a simple module which provides functions to calculate
the signed distance and travel time to an interface described by the
zero contour of the input array phi.

```python
import skfmm
import numpy as np
phi = np.ones((3, 3))
phi[1, 1] = -1
skfmm.distance(phi)
```

  ```python
   array([[ 1.20710678,  0.5       ,  1.20710678],
          [ 0.5       , -0.35355339,  0.5       ],
          [ 1.20710678,  0.5       ,  1.20710678]])
  ```
---
```python
skfmm.travel_time(phi, speed = 3.0 * np.ones_like(phi))
```

   ```python
   array([[ 0.40236893,  0.16666667,  0.40236893],
          [ 0.16666667,  0.11785113,  0.16666667],
          [ 0.40236893,  0.16666667,  0.40236893]])
   ```
---

The input array can be of 1, 2, 3 or higher dimensions and can be a
masked array. A function is provided to compute extension velocities.
