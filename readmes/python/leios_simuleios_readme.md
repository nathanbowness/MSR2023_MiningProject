Learning to code with scientific examples.

=========

I will be teaching my subscribers how to code in C++, Fortran, and Python in the next few months and have decided to use github for this purpose. We will then start working on all sorts of coding projects.

=========

This project will be significantly different than other projects intended to teach coding to anyone willing to learn. Instead of teaching basic coding principles, we will be looking at different aspects of real and fictional worlds and simulating them in order to teach fundamental lessons about coding -- particularly scientific computation. 

As another note: my own coding style is significantly different than those who have had formal training in Computer Science. I will be teaching in the way I find most interesting and fulfilling. Please feel free to drop in and learn a little about different coding practices when you have the time!

Toodles!

PS: I think I will have a video up detailing each of the lessons, so feel free to stop by my youtube chanel every once in a while.
