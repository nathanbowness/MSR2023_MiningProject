packs that increase the maximum build height.\r\n- Added debugs to log what program arguments were passed to MCA Selector and how MCA Selector parsed them.\r\n- Fixed a bug where filters were not applied to chunks that had `entities` or `poi` data, but no `region` data.\r\n- Fixed and improved the structure filter. It now detects all kinds of combinations of Minecraft's internal structure names as vanilla structure names, with or without the `minecraft:` namespace.\r\n- Fixed a bug where chunk sections were not merged correctly (#360).\r\n- Removed the wiki files from the main repository and moved them to [their own repository](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector-wiki) for more independent contribution.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/72173603/reactions", "total_count": 24, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 3, "hooray": 11, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}}

This filter is basically the content of a JavaScript function returning either `true` or `false`, indicating whether the chunk should be selected or not. All chunk data can be accessed. The value `region` contains all region data, `poi` all POI data and `entities` all entity data. The chunk data structure is a Java CompoundTag Object of the [NBT library](https://github.com/Querz/NBT/tree/nbt7). Example: `return region.getString(\"Status\") == \"full\"` will be a custom version of the `Status = \"full\"` filter.\r\n- Added a `Custom` field for the NBT Changer. This works similar to the `Custom` filter, except that the JavaScript function doesn't have any return value. However, all changes made to the NBT structure in `region`, `poi`, and `entities` will be saved. Example: `region.putString(\"Status\", \"empty\")` will be a custom version of the `Status = \"empty\"` field change.\r\n- (Most likely) fixed a problem where Minecraft 1.19 would freeze any world generation and saving after attempting to generate lighting in a protochunk that is adjacent to a full chunk where MCA Selector deleted some sections. MCA Selector will now reset the chunk's `Status` field back to `features` after deleting sections to force Minecraft to recalculate any lighting data in that chunk.\r\n- Added error handlers for all multithreaded jobs to make sure that the progress bar doesn't get stuck and to catch any uncaught exceptions.\r\n- Added the Wiki to this repository so people can edit it and create pull requests. The Wiki files in [this folder](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/tree/master/doc) will be synced with the wiki repository on every push to this repository.\r\n- Fixed a bug where CLI mode would skip saving files and then freeze the progress bar.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/70914208/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 1}}

Also: 2.0!\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a bug please let me know by creating a bug report issue [Here](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or ping me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/h942U8U).\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where entire regions would be imported when importing chunks without an offset.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the coordinates in the status bar would be off by one when hovering over blocks with negative coordinates.\r\n- Added mappings for Minecraft 1.19.\r\n- `ReplaceBlocks` now supports regular expressions to select blocks. Regular expressions need to be in single quotes. As an example, here is how to replace all blocks in a chunk with air: `'.+'=minecraft:air`.\r\n- `SkyLight` and `BlockLight` data will now be deleted when using `ReplaceBlocks` in the hope Minecraft recalculates those values.\r\n- Added an option in the long array editor to view 32-bit values.\r\n- Added `invalid` biome mapping. This \"biome\" can be used in Minecraft versions that still use numeric biome IDs to set the biome id to `-1` which will force Minecraft to regenerate the biomes (no the terrain!).\r\n- The chunk editor will now automatically expand the root tag for convenience.\r\n- Removed `File --> Open Region` so people avoid the mistake of omitting the `poi` and `entities` folders when manipulating their world. The `poi` and `entities` folders can still be manually changed through the `File --> Settings --> World` dialog.\r\n- Added a dialog to choose between overwriting and merging when importing a selection.\r\n- Added an error message for when saving or loading a selection failed.\r\n- Added a flag to keep track of whether a selection has just been saved.\r\n- Rephrased the confirmation dialog that appears when quitting with an unsaved selection and made this dialog appear when opening a new world if necessary.\r\n- Clearing the cache no longer clears the selection.\r\n- Added more options to render images in CLI image mode.\r\n- Added more options to render overlays in CLI image mode.\r\n- Removed unused translations.\r\n- Implemented a new selection model that uses way less memory and should be unnoticeably faster. This should fix some bugs with inverted selections as well, such as applying a filter to an inverted selection removing the wrong chunks from the selection.\r\n- Switched to a new and better, more cache oriented version of the NBT library.\r\n- Replaced the old logging / debug system, with log4J2. The log files are now persistent and roll over into a new log file on start-up. The `Print debug messages` option in the `Settings` now enables logging of `DEBUG` level for the log file. Warnings and errors will always be logged to the log file. Only errors will be logged to the console.\r\n- Reworked the CLI code, it now uses commons-cli to validate command line arguments. Also added a `--help` command that prints out a manual page.\r\n- When specifying world folders in CLI mode, a new parameter `--world` (or `--source-world`, or `--output-world`, depending on the context) is now required. This option automatically searches in the provided folder for a `region`, `poi` and `entities` folder, while having a `region` folder is mandatory. Those folders can be overwritten manually by using the old `--region`, `--poi` and `--entities` (or `--source-region`, `--source-poi`, etc.) parameters, but they should generally not be used except in very specific use cases.\r\n- Changed the CLI to show an actual progress bar.\r\n- Switched CI from Travis to GitHub Actions. Release assets are now automatically created and uploaded to the release.\r\n- Cleaned up `build.gradle` and moved scripts to external script files.\r\n- Updated version to 2.0 so people don't confuse the MCA Selector version with the Minecraft version (lol).

If you would like to give feedback to improve the Wiki or the README, feel free to contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/h942U8U).\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n- Fixed Swedish translation (see #271).\r\n- Fixed Japanese translation (see #272).\r\n- Fixed Czech translation (see #273).\r\n- Added Turkish translation (see #280).\r\n- Added `PlayerSpawn` filter. This filter loads player data files from a directory and reads their spawn points. The syntax works like this: `<directory><path-separator><dimension>`. e.g.: `C:\\Some\\Folder;minecraft:overworld`. The path separator character on Windows is `;`, on Mac / Linux `:`.\r\n- Added `PlayerLocation` filter. Works the same way as the PlayerSpawn filter, but reads the location at which the players have logged out from. PlayerLocation and PlayerSpawn filter also work like the xPos and zPos filters - if the filter query allows skipping of entire region files it will do so.\r\n- Added Circle filter. This will create a circular selection with a given center point and radius in chunks. The syntax is `<center-x>;<center-z>;<radius>`. Multiple of these can be chained using a comma `,`.\r\n- Added an \"Invert selected regions\" option in the `Selection` menu. This will invert a selection, but only if a region contains any selected chunks. This only works when the selection is currently not inverted using the other \"Invert\" function.\r\n- Added an \"Overwrite selection\" option to the Chunk filter dialog. When this is enabled, any previously existing selection will be overwritten by the selection resulting from the current filter. When disabled, all selected chunks resulting from the current filter will instead be added to the current selection.\r\n- Updated color mappings for 1.18.\r\n- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash on startup when the directory containing the mcaselector.jar file contains an exclamation mark at the beginning or in the middle of folder names. There is currently a problem with folder names containing an exclamation mark at the end, which will not be fixed in this release. This is a bug in the Java standard library that loads resources from the jar file. The associated bug report can be found here: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4523159 . The issue is over 20 years old and I don't expect it to be fixed in the near future.\r\n- Fixed a bug where clearing the cacne for a selection would use an incorrect regexp to list image files.\r\n- Fixed a bug where inverted selections would not be rendered correctly on empty regions.\r\n- Fixed a bug where regions with DataVersion > 2843 would not be minimized correctly for memory. This resulted in regions not being rendered for some zoom levels.\r\n- Fixed a bug where parsing a cached image file's name would throw an NPE.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the world config is not loaded when using `File --> Open Region`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/54282051/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 10, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

The tabs on the left are global settings, the tabs on the right are per-world settings:\r\n  * **Global**: contains settings such as language and selection colors\r\n  * **Processing**: contains settings related to threads and memory usage. The `Read Threads` slider has been removed. The `Max files` slider has been repurposed to indicating how many region files are kept in memory for faster rendering.\r\n  * **Rendering**: contains settings for rendering the current world.\r\n  * **World**: this is the old `World Settings` dialog. The `poi` and `entities` folders can be set manually here.\r\n* The `Render settings` menu option is now a shortcut to the *Rendering* tab.\r\n* Added a cave renderer. It can be enabled in the *Rendering* tab.\r\n* Huge rework of how threads are handled:\r\n  * Removed the the load data jobs.\r\n  * Added a more secure way to load, process and save data (especially for rendering) to not have any bottlenecks that might use up too much memory.\r\n  * Removed the threadpool that loads cached images and let them load through the main scheduler.\r\n  * The main scheduler now uses a new type of queue that prioritizes loading from cache (because it's faster) and regions in the center of the screen.\r\n  * Map draws are now at a fixed rate, and they are not dictated by how fast images are loaded (which might have caused lags).\r\n  * Map updates are now also at a fixed rate in their own thread and independent of map draws to avoid lags.\r\n  * Reduced the default amount of threads used for the scheduler. This value can be adjusted in the **Processing** settings.\r\n* Huge rework for the rendering pipeline:\r\n  * Only the actually needed image is now rendered and cached. E.g. if zoomed out completely, only a 64x64 image of each region is rendered (compared to before where the 512x512 version was always rendered and then scaled to fit) which should be significantly faster.\r\n  * When *any* image is found in either the memory cache or the file cache, it is now used to display the region. The incentive is to have *any* image over having *no* image at all, no matter the scale. The appropriate image will be loaded or generated later on.\r\n* Added an option to the chunk import dialog to shift sections vertically. This can be used in combination with the `Sections` option to avoid overwriting existing sections in the target chunk with empty sections.\r\n* Improved drawing regions and the chunk- and region grid to use floating point calculations instead of integers.\r\n* MCA Selector now keeps track of when a region file was last saved and rerenders an image automatically when it detects that an image is outdated. It is checking for images being outdated whenever they are loaded from disk cache.\r\n* Added the menu option `View --> Reload` to manually trigger reloading the map view and checking which images are outdated.\r\n* Added default biome color mapping to avoid unknown biomes being rendered in grayscale.\r\n* Added a warning dialog when attempting to quit while having a selection.\r\n* Whenever the config is loaded from file, it is now printed as a debug.\r\n* Rewrote most of the version specific code for simplification.\r\n* Biome color mappings are now version specific (due to the switch to biome palettes in the 1.18 snapshots).\r\n* Switched to fastutil's maps for big datastructures (like selections) to make them faster and more memory efficient.\r\n* Added license for fastutil.\r\n* Changed the `visible` label to `queue` which now shows the number of tasks being queued.\r\n* Improved and unified null checks when parsing, filtering or changing data.\r\n* Changed the default chunk filter to be `InhabitedTime < \"5 minutes\"` because this seems to be the most commonly used filter.\r\n* Reduced the default JVM max memory for the Windows installer version to 4GB.\r\n* Added support for 1-3 bit views in the array editor.\r\n* Added a filter for `yPos`.\r\n* Fixed a bug where selecting from a filter threw an NPE when applying a radius without applying to an existing selection (see #268).\r\n* Fixed a bug where filtering entities wouldn't work for worlds below Minecraft version 1.17.\r\n* Fixed a bug where MC saves dir, and debug options were not saved while changing them when no world was open.\r\n* Fixed a crash when the parent directory was a symlink when creating cache, log and settings files and directories (see #265).\r\n* Fixed a bug where parsing and stringifying the `ReplaceBlocks` field would strip single quotes for custom block names.\r\n* Fixed a bug where the world config was not saved when quitting.\r\n* Fixed a bug where sections would not render when the block palette would have a length of 1 and no block states array.\r\n* Fixed some typos in the Czech translation, see #246 .\r\n* Fixed japanese translation, see #240 .", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/52515268/reactions", "total_count": 26, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 11, "confused": 0, "heart": 15, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

The path to the field needs to be provided in the custom data field.\r\n  * The path *must* start with either `region`, `poi`, or `entities`.\r\n  * An index inside a list can be accessed with a number in block brackets, e.g. `[0]` to access the first entry in a list.\r\n  * The size of a list, compound tag or array tag can be accessed by appending `.size` at the end.\r\n  * When not measuring the size of a tag, the last tag must be any number type tag.\r\n  * Example: `entities/Entities.size` would measure the amount of entities in a Minecraft 1.17 world.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused the map view to scroll upwards indefinitely after pressing the UP-arrow key on some systems, see #229 . When the focus is on the Menu bar or on the height slider, the focus can be given back to the map view by pressing `Escape`.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused the map view to not load the last chunk in a region file in an edge case.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused entities to not be relocated from a 1.17 world, see #222 .\r\n* Added missing documentation for input-selection import parameter to Readme.\r\n* Fixed an NPE that was thrown when trying to save chunk timestamps into a nonexisting chunk.\r\n* Updated supported version in Readme, see #226 .\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused container tag names to be editable inside list tags in the NBT editor.\r\n* Added Japanese (Japan) translation (thanks to @Uguisu64J for translating), see #231 .\r\n* Updated the bug report template on GitHub.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/45866712/reactions", "total_count": 42, "+1": 27, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 9, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

If you were not using the Windows installer before, you will most likely have to upgrade to Java 16 to continue using MCA Selector. The [installation instructions in the Readme](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector#using-a-jre-or-jdk-with-pre-packed-javafx-the-simple-way) have been updated accordingly.**\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n* Everything has been updated to use Java 16. For the Windows installer, everything has been taken care of and it should update everything on its own, but when trying to run the standalone jar file, you will need to update your Java installation to 16 and install JavaFX or use a JRE or JDK that comes with JavaFX pre-packed. The Readme has been updated with step-by-step instructions.\r\n* Added support to render layers. This can be configured through `File --> World Settings` after opening a world (This dialog can be quickly opened by pressing `E`):\r\n  * `Render height` is the topmost layer of blocks on the y-axis that will be rendered.\r\n  * `Layer only` indicates whether to render *only* the layer from `Render height`, or that layer and everything below.\r\n* Added a render height slider to the right side of the menu bar, which does exactly the same as the `Render height` slider from the `World Settings` dialog.\r\n* Added scroll wheel support to all sliders.\r\n* Added options to toggle smooth rendering in the Settings.\r\n* The currently selected overlay is now highlighted in the Overlay dialog.\r\n* Persistence of world settings has been improved.\r\n* Image caching will now occasionally be skipped if it turns out to be the bottleneck of rendering.\r\n* Added an option in `Settings` to change the background pattern for better visibility when a lot of dark things are displayed.\r\n* Added an option in `Settings` to toggle whether non-existent regions should be displayed as dark gray squares.\r\n* Made some performance optimizations when drawing images to make the render height slider work more smoothly while being closely zoomed in.\r\n* Added keyboard shortcuts for the `Settings` and `World Settings` dialogs\r\n* Made the Overlay Editor dialog non-blocking:\r\n  * When the dialog is open, it is still possible to fully interact with the rest of the program.\r\n  * Overlays will update in real-time (or as fast as your processor can handle) while editing overlays in the editor, as long as they are enabled. It will automatically switch to the currenctly edited overlay.\r\n* Fixed a bug with all overlays that displayed an amount of something (e.g. entities) not parsing the max value correctly.\r\n* Removed support for world height 384 for 1.17. This does not change anything in most use cases when you use the CavesAndCliffsPreview datapack, except for the following two:\r\n  * Replacing blocks through `Tools --> Change fields --> ReplaceBlocks` does not replace air below Y=0 and above Y=255.\r\n  * Setting a biome through `Tools --> Change fields --> Biome` with `Force` enabled will not work for chunks that don't have biomes generated yet.\r\n* Removed special Nether rendering due to now customizable render height.\r\n* Updated mappings to 1.17.\r\n* Fixed some CSS that broke due to the upgrade to Java 16.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused the Entities filter to not work in Minecraft 1.17 worlds.\r\n* Fixed a bug that created an incorrectly sized array when force setting biome ids in 1.17 in empty chunks.\r\n* Fixed encoding when updating translations.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused replacing blocks to fail for 1.14+ worlds.\r\n* Fixed a bug where block replacement was using the wrong implementation for 1.16 worlds.\r\n* Fixed the text fields attached to a slider throwing an Exception when the input was not a valid number.\r\n* Fixed some concurrency issues when changing render settings while rendering is in progress.\r\n* Fixed a concurrency issue when loading mapping implementations.\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused the DataVersion overlay to not save correctly and turn into an InhabitedTime overlay.\r\n* Cleaned up the code (a little bit)\u2122", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/43995338/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

values.\r\n* Added a way to select \"bits\" and \"overlap\" in the array editor when editing long arrays (especially the BlockStates array):\r\n  * \"Bits\": The bits per values.\r\n  * \"Overlap\": Whether remaining bits in one long value should be ignored or \"overlap\" into the next long value.\r\n* Added support for overlays when saving a selection as an image. The overlay has to be active for it to be saved.\r\n* Fixed some translations for `pt_BR`, see #196 .\r\n* Fixed a bug when parsing environment variables in linux that contained multiple paths.\r\n* Added names to (almost) all threads and thread pools to make debugging easier.\r\n* Fixed image creation through CLI throwing an Exception.\r\n* Added \"equal\" and \"not equal\" operators for the Palette filter, see #159 .\r\n* Clearly distinguish between a chunk's timestamp and LastUpdate in the NBT changer and the Chunk filter:\r\n  * Timestamp is the time in epoch seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00) when the chunk was last saved.\r\n  * LastUpdate is the time in ticks since world creation when the chunk was last saved.\r\n* Added biome colors.\r\n* Slightly improved performance when rendering the map.\r\n\r\nWe are now sponsored by JetBrains and their amazing [Open Source Program](https://jb.gg/OpenSource)!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Querz/mcaselector/releases/42768381/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 1}}

It was removed in 1.14 due to an oversight when rewriting region loading for Minecraft 1.17. See #188 .\r\n* Updated mappings for 21w14a.\r\n* Added an `intercepts` comparator for filters that can have multiple values, e.g. the Palette filter.

Keep in mind that for 1.17 worlds, a `entities` directory has to be set or a 1.17 world has to be opened via `Open World`.\r\n  * `#TileEntities` shows the amount of tile entities in a chunk.\r\n  * `AverageHeight` shows the average height of all topmost blocks in a chunk.\r\n  * `DataVersion` shows the data version of a chunk.\r\n  * `#Blocks` shows the total amount of the specified block types in a chunk. The list of block types can be specified the same way as in `Palette`-filter of the chunk filter.\r\n  * Overlay configurations are saved globally, same as all the other settings.\r\n  * To view an overlay, its checkbox needs to be enabled in the overlay editor and all its inputs must be valid. It is then possible to cycle through all valid and active overlays in the main map view by pressing `O`.\r\n  * The current overlay with its minimum and maximum value as well as the currently hovered chunk's value are displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the window.\r\n* Updated mappings for 21w11a\r\n* Changed the way how the Windows installer installs dependencies, they are now in a separate `lib` folder. The fat jar (not the one for the installer) is unaffected by this.\r\n* Fixed a bug where waterlogged blocks were only rendered as water, see #181\r\n* The import dialog's `Sections` field's validation has been adjusted to better work with negative numbers.\r\n* Improved the way shutting down MCA Selector was handled by assigning priorities to the different tasks.\r\n* Made sure that the JRE that was installed with the Windows installer will be deleted when uninstalling / reinstalling.\r\n* Fixed some concurrency issues related to rendering.\r\n* Fixed a bug where importing without an offset would not import anything\r\n* Fixed a bug where exporting chunks to another folder would overwrite the source files in headless mode, see #180\r\n* Added the `FixStatus` option in the NBT Changer. This sets the status of chunks, that have terrain data but their status set as `empty` to `full`, to attempt to fix a problem that sometimes happens when optimizing a very old world over a very long upgrade path."}

Always make backups of your world before using MCA Selector. If you encounter any bugs, please report them either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/h942U8U).\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n- Added support for *entities* and *poi* files. They will now be adjusted when copying, deleting, merging and moving chunks.\r\n- Added support for the 21w06a height changes.\r\n- Added `Open World` option in the `File` menu that will replace the current `Open` option. The old `Open` option has been renamed to `Open Region`. `Open World` now detects an entire Minecraft world, including `poi` and `entities` folders. To use `Open World`, navigate to your *world* folder (not the *region* folder!), click *Open* and you will see a window displaying all dimensions found for this world. Select the one you want to view / edit, and press *OK*. If your world only has a single dimension (e.g. if you haven't explored the Nether or the End yet, this dialog will be skipped.\r\n- Added a `World Settings` option in the `File` menu that allows to specify the world's *entities* and *poi* folders manually.\r\n- Made grass color more green instead of blue.\r\n- Added new Structure filter by @Polarbub , see #164 .\r\n- Added error dialogs for some occasions.\r\n- Reworked headless mode to work with the separation of *region*, *poi* and *entities* folders.\r\n- Removed the `--headless` parameter - it is now automatically switching to headless mode as soon as there are any parameters.\r\n- Slightly changed the command structure and renamed some commands. An overview of the command structure can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/88e1887eb441c1f0f60af6eb3dfcf7917b16544a/commands-diagram.png).\r\n- Added some tools that can be used in headless mode to make translations easier: --mode printMissingTranslations` which lists all missing translations, `--mode printTranslation <locale>` which prints a full translation file, including untranslated keys and `--mode printTranslationKeys` which prints all translation keys.\r\n- Improved the chunk editor, it now shows the chunk data of *region*, *poi* and *entities*.\r\n- The chunk editor now allows to completely delete a chunk by deleting the root compound tag or to create a new chunk by creating a new root compound tag.\r\n- Added a \"Reset zoom\" option in the `View` menu.\r\n- It is now allowed for a filter to be limited to a selection in all scenarios. This option also works in headless mode, see #161 .\r\n- The chunk filter dialog now remembers the selected options in addition to the filter.\r\n- Added a new field for the `Change NBT` dialog: \"ReplaceBlocks\"\r\n  - A list of block replacements can be supplied, in the following format:\r\n    `<block-name>=<block-name|block-nbt>[;<tile-nbt>]`\r\n    Examples:\r\n    - `iron_block=diamond_block` will replace all iron blocks with diamond blocks in the selection\r\n    - `iron_block={Name:\"minecraft:chest\",Properties:{facing:east,type:single}};{id:\"minecraft:chest\",Items:[{Slot:0b,id:\"minecraft:stone\",Count:1b}]}` will replace all iron blocks with east-facing single chests that contain 1 stone in the first slot.\r\n- Added a way to save the current view as an image (`View-->Save Screenshot`).\r\n- Added a way to save the current selection as an image (`Selection-->Export as image`). Depending on the size of the selection, this might take a while.\r\n- Added CI with travis to build an automatic Windows installer that installs MCA Selector as a Windows desktop application. It will download an appropriate standalone JRE to run MCA Selector, so you don't have to. It can also create a desktop shortcut. The installer will be attached below alongside the usual .jar file.\r\n- The path to the currently opened world is now displayed in the window title.\r\n- Updated mappings to 21w08a.\r\n- Fixed a concurrency issue with the progress bar (i hope) that would sometimes cause the progress bar to become stuck.\r\n- Doubled the maximum zoom level, you can now zoom out much further. This requires MCA Selector to have a maximum heap size of at least 4 GB.\r\n- Added an option in the `Settings` to configure the default Minecraft saves directory, see #163 .\r\n- Fixed a bug that caused the filter box in the filter editor to throw an exception when switching between text based filters (e.g. from \"Status\" to \"Palette\" filter)\r\n- Fixed a bug where it was assumed that Palette index 0 does always contain air. This bug caused some chunks to render incorrectly, see #157 .\r\n- Fixed a bug where unmarking a partially marked region in region selection mode would not work.\r\n- Made some type checks in filters and the rendering process more lenient.\r\n- Added support for oversized chunks that are saved as .mcc files, see #169 .\r\n- Made some code more future-proof."}

This should work with all existing features involving selections, like deleting, exporting and changing chunks but also copying and importing chunks.\r\n* Group filters can now be negated using a `!` before a group. E.g. `!(xPos < -10 OR xPos >  10)` will select a vertical strip in the middle of the world.\r\n* Added a Dutch translation (thanks to @Clijmart for translating)\r\n* Added an Italian translation (thanks to @valeilsimpaticone for translating)\r\n* Added a Polish translation (thanks for @Marcinolak for translating)\r\n* Updated the gradle wrapper to 6.6.1 and fixed all related deprecation errors.\r\n* Added instructions to create a `.bat` or `.sh` file to run MCA Selector.\r\n* Added unit tests for rendering the map, importing chunks and some small tests for filters.\r\n* Fixed instructions about how to execute MCA Selector using PowerShell\r\n* Fixed a bug where switching a filter condition for another would forget the comparator and operator. When switching \"compatible\" conditions (e.g. `xPos` to `zPos`), they will retain their operator, comparator and value.\r\n* Fixed a bug where the `Status` filter would not work.\r\n* Fixed a bug where the file dialog would throw an exception and not open if the current world directory was deleted while MCA Selector was running.\r\n* Failing to log something should not interfere with the main program anymore.\r\n* Fixed a bug where logging an exception could throw an uncaught NPE\r\n* Fixed a bug where the css was not minified correctly in the final jar.\r\n* Fixed a bug where de-fragmenting an mca-file would throw an exception if the last chunk was not padded.\r\n* Fixed a bug where biome indexes were calculated incorrectly for Minecraft 1.15+.\r\n* Fixed a rare bug where any text in MCA Selector would be rendered incorrectly (\"garbled text\") by bundling a custom font with the final jar.\r\n* Fixed a bug where MCA Selector would attempt to create images if no world was loaded.\r\n* Reworked version specific implementations for rendering, filtering and changing NBT data for easier support of future versions without breaking old versions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**MCA Selector modifies and deletes chunks in your Minecraft world.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/Querz/008111195cc7bc012bb291849d2eb9c7) is a document with some tips and tricks regarding 1.16.**\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n* Fixed a bug where filtering for chunks containing air wouldn't work correctly\r\n* Fixed a bug where `LOCALAPPDATA` on Windows was divided into two paths because it was using the same code used for Linux that divided environment variables containing multiple paths into their individual pieces.\r\n* Updated entity mappings to include new entities added in recent snapshots\r\n* Updated installation instructions to include a Java version check in the console.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Requirements\":\r\n* Either:\r\n  * 64bit JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp)\r\n  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation\r\n* A computer\r\n  * At least 6 GB of RAM. If lower, more RAM has to manually be assigned to the JVM using the `-Xmx` argument. Assigning 4 GB is recommended.\r\n* A brain\r\n\r\n### What works on most systems\r\nMost likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard). If not, you can try `java -jar mcaselector-1.12.3.jar` from your console. If this doesn't work, you might want to look into how to modify the `PATH` variable on your system to tell your system that java is an executable program.\r\n\r\n### If you have Minecraft Java Edition installed\r\nMinecraft Java Edition comes with a JRE that you can use to start the MCA Selector, so there is no need to install another version of Java on your system.\r\n\r\nFor Windows:\r\n* Hold `Shift` and Right-click on an empty space and select `Open PowerShell window here` (`Open Command window here` on Windows 8 and earlier).\r\n* Type `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Minecraft\\runtime\\jre-x64\\bin\\java -jar `, then drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.12.3.jar into the console` and press `Enter`.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS:\r\n* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`.\r\n* Type `~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/runtime/jre-x64/jre.bundle/Contents/Home/bin/java -jar ` (with a space at the end), then drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.12.3.jar` into the console and press `Enter`.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** For MacOS 10.14+ (Mojave) It is NOT recommended to use the JRE provided by Minecraft (1.8.0_74), because it contains a severe bug that causes JavaFX applications to crash when they lose focus while a dialog window (such as the save-file-dialog) is open (see the bug report [here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304)). This bug has been fixed in Java 1.8.0_201 and above.\r\n\r\n### If you receive a JavaFX error\r\n\"When I run `mcaselector-1.12.3.jar`, an error dialog appears that looks like this:\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/84ccd7e9b8e70b885a36f8bdf8fce62953be00b2/missing_javafx.png\" alt=\"Popup dialog stating a missing JavaFX installation\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nOpen the console or terminal on your OS.\r\n\r\nFor Windows:\r\n* Hold `Shift` and Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select `Open PowerShell here` (`Open Command window here` on Windows 8 and earlier).\r\n\r\nFor MacOS:\r\n* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`.\r\n\r\nType the command `java -version` and press `Enter`. If the output shows that your java command is linked to `java version \"1.8.0\"`, you can simply run MCA Selector through the console.\r\n\r\nFor Windows and MacOS:\r\n* Type `java -jar ` (with a space at the end) and drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.12.3.jar` into the console and hit `Enter`.\r\n\r\nFor Linux:\r\n* Run `java -jar <path to mcaselector-1.12.3.jar` where you replace everything in `<>`.\r\n\r\nIf the output shows a Java version higher than Java 8, please find and download the appropriate JavaFX version from [Here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). If you know what to do, do it. If you don't, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nFor Windows:\r\n* Download \"JavaFX Windows SDK\" for your Java version from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).\r\n* Unzip the `.zip`-file with your program of choice, then navigate into the unzipped folder.\r\n* Hold `Shift` and Right-click on an empty space in that folder and select `Open PowerShell window here` (`Open Command window here` on Windows 8 and earlier). Type `java --module-path ` (with a space at the end), then drag and drop the `lib`-folder into the console. Continue to type ` --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar ` (with a space at the beginning and the end), then drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.12.3.jar` into the console and hit `Enter`.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS:\r\n* Download \"JavaFX Mac OS X SDK\" for your Java version from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).\r\n* Double-click the `.zip`-file to unpack, then navigate into the unzipped folder.\r\n* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`.

In headless mode when generating cache files, the output directory must still be provided with the `--output` parameter.\r\n* The log file directory can now be opened by clicking a link in the settings.\r\n* Updated the Readme accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Requirements\":\r\n* Either:\r\n  * 64bit JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp)\r\n  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation\r\n* A computer\r\n  * At least 6 GB of RAM. If lower, more RAM has to manually be assigned to the JVM using the `-Xmx` argument. Assigning 4 GB is recommended.\r\n* A brain\r\n\r\n#### If you have Java from Oracle installed on your system\r\n\r\nMost likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard). If not, you can try `java -jar mcaselector-1.12.1.jar` from your console. If this doesn't work, you might want to look into how to modify the `PATH` variable on your system to tell your system that java is an executable program.\r\n\r\n#### If you have Minecraft Java Edition installed on your system\r\n\r\nMinecraft Java Edition comes with a JRE that you can use to start the MCA Selector, so there is no need to install another version of java on your system. On Windows, that java version is usually located in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Minecraft\\runtime\\jre-x64\\bin\\` and once inside this folder you can simply run `java.exe -jar <path-to-mcaselector-\r\n.jar>`. On Mac OS you should find it in `~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/runtime/jre-x64/jre.bundle/Contents/Home/bin/` where you can execute `./java -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.12.1.jar>`.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** For macOS 10.14+ (Mojave) It is NOT recommended to use the JRE provided by Minecraft (1.8.0_74), because it contains a severe bug that causes JavaFX applications to crash when they lose focus while a dialog window (such as the save-file-dialog) is open (see the bug report [here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304)). This bug has been fixed in Java 1.8.0_201 and above.\r\n\r\n#### If you are using OpenJDK\r\n\r\nIf you are using a distribution of OpenJDK, you have to make sure that it comes with [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), as it is needed to run the MCA Selector. Some distributions like AdoptOpenJDK (shipped with most Linux distributions) do not ship with JavaFX by default. On Debian distributions, an open version of JavaFX is contained in the `openjfx` package. This or some other installation of JavaFX is required to run the `.jar`.\r\n\r\n#### If you are using Java 11 or higher\r\n\r\nIf you are using Java 11 or higher, the JavaFX modules are not included automatically. You will need to include them by specifying the module path for JavaFX. Some examples are included below, but you may need to edit paths if your system stores the JavaFX modules in a different location.\r\n\r\nOn Windows with Oracle Java 13:\r\n```\r\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-13.0.1\\bin\\java.exe\" --module-path \"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\javafx-sdk-13.0.1\\lib\" --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar mcaselector-1.12.1.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Debian with OpenJDK 11 and openjfx:\r\n```\r\njava --module-path /usr/share/openjfx/lib --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar mcaselector-1.12.1.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n##\r\nIf none of these instructions work, apply \"A brain\" that you providently held ready after having read the \"Requirements\" section carefully."}

The colors can still be changed separately in the settings.\r\n* Copy-Paste:\r\n  * Make a selection\r\n  * Use `Selections --> Copy chunks` or press `Ctrl+C` (`Cmd+C` on Mac) to copy the selection to the clipboard.\r\n  * Go to where you want the selection to be pasted. Copying works through instances of MCA Selector, so you can even close and reopen the program! Open a different world, stay in the same world and navigate to the desired location.\r\n  * Use `Selections --> Paste chunks` or press `Ctrl+V` (`Cmd+V` on Mac) to display an overlay that shows where the chunks would be pasted.\r\n  * Move the overlay to the desired location by pressing and holding the `left mouse button`.\r\n  * Pasting can be cancelled by pressing `Esc`.\r\n  * Use `Selections --> Paste chunks` or press `Ctrl+V` again to open the `Import chunks` dialog, prefilled with the offset values according to your choice.\r\n  * Make your choice with the remaining options and press `OK` to start the import.\r\n* Added a new option in the settings to change the color of the Pasting overlay.\r\n* Fixed a bug where key combinations that opened a dialog would be stuck and mess with scrolling and zooming on trackpads after closing the dialog.\r\n* Tweaked the default values for the Threadpool so MCA Selector doesn't use 100% of all available processor cores.\r\n* A dialog with an error is now shown before the program starts when JavaFX has not been found.\r\n* Updated the screenshots and documentation in the Readme.\r\n* Added translation to Portuguese (Portugal) (thanks to [@D3W10](https://github.com/D3W10) for translating).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Requirements\":\r\n* Either:\r\n  * 64bit JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp)\r\n  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation\r\n* A computer\r\n  * At least 6 GB of RAM.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/Querz/008111195cc7bc012bb291849d2eb9c7) is a document with some tips and tricks regarding 1.16.**\r\n\r\n### Details:\r\n* Fixed spanish translation (thanks to [@NathanielFreeman](https://github.com/NathanielFreeman).\r\n* Fixed some information regarding compatibility in the Readme. MCA Files were first introduced in 1.2.1, not Beta 1.3.\r\n* Removed unused icon for a \"default NBT tag\" from resources.\r\n* Improved rendering for underwater features, now showing hints of the color of the blocks and better showing the depth of the water. This can still be disabled in the settings.\r\n* Added support for comma separated ranges when deleting chunks. The field `DeleteSections` now accepts ranges in the format `<from>:<to>`. E.g: `3:7` means \"all sections from 3 to 7, inclusive\". From and to can be omitted to define no upper and/or lower bounds, e.g. `:7` means \"all seaction up to 7, inclusive\".\r\n* Added support for custom entities with custom namespaces in the chunk filter. Defining an entity without a namespace automatically assumes the namespace `minecraft:`. Use single quotes to define custom entities. When using single quotes, a namespace _must_ be defined.\r\n* Added support to import specific sections when importing chunks:\r\n  * The field uses the same range syntax as the `DeleteSections` field in the NBT Changer.\r\n  * Merges Biomes, Entities, TileTicks, TileEntities, LiquidTicks, Lights, LightsToBeTicked, ToBeTicked and PostProcessing fields.\r\n  * When merging into an empty or non-existing chunk, its `Status` is set to `full`.\r\n  * Entity UUIDs are randomized to avoid duplicates.\r\n  * Minecraft does weird things with biomes, so they might not show up correctly in game.\r\n* Updated dependencies to use NBT 5.5.\r\n* Updated documentation, discord badge and screenshots in the Readme.\r\n* Fixed a crash when processing indexed but nonexistent chunks in region files.\r\n* Fixed a memory overflow error when logging too many exceptions.\r\n* Fixed an error that occurred when drawing chunks of an \"optimized\" world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Requirements\":\r\n* Either:\r\n  * JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/)\r\n  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation\r\n* A computer\r\n* A brain\r\n\r\n#### If you have Java from Oracle installed on your system\r\n\r\nMost likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard). If not, you can try `java -jar mcaselector-1.11.jar` from your console. If this doesn't work, you might want to look into how to modify the `PATH` variable on your system to tell your system that java is an executable program.\r\n\r\n#### If you have Minecraft Java Edition installed on your system\r\n\r\nMinecraft Java Edition comes with a JRE that you can use to start the MCA Selector, so there is no need to install another version of java on your system. On Windows, that java version is usually located in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Minecraft\\runtime\\jre-x64\\bin\\` and once inside this folder you can simply run `java.exe -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.11.jar>`. On Mac OS you should find it in `~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/runtime/jre-x64/jre.bundle/Contents/Home/bin/` where you can execute `./java -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.11.jar>`.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** For macOS 10.14+ (Mojave) It is NOT recommended to use the JRE provided by Minecraft (1.8.0_74), because it contains a severe bug that causes JavaFX applications to crash when they lose focus while a dialog window (such as the save-file-dialog) is open (see the bug report [here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304)). This bug has been fixed in Java 1.8.0_201 and above.\r\n\r\n#### If you are using OpenJDK\r\n\r\nIf you are using a distribution of OpenJDK, you have to make sure that it comes with [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), as it is needed to run the MCA Selector. Some distributions like AdoptOpenJDK (shipped with most Linux distributions) do not ship with JavaFX by default. On Debian distributions, an open version of JavaFX is contained in the `openjfx` package. This or some other installation of JavaFX is required to run the `.jar`.\r\n\r\n#### If you are using Java 11 or higher\r\n\r\nIf you are using Java 11 or higher, the JavaFX modules are not included automatically. You will need to include them by specifying the module path for JavaFX.

Shading can be disabled in the settings to return to the old render style. Shading for water can be turned of separately, as it might be slower than shading for land.\r\n* Made rendering slightly faster by writing directly to an int array instead of the `PixelWriter` for every pixel.\r\n* Added `DeleteSections` feature to the NBT Changer. It works similar to `DeleteEntities`; setting it to `1` or `true` it will delete all sections of the chunks. This only works for already generated chunks, so in order to make e.g. a Skyblock world, you would need to let Minecraft generate the world first before deleting the sections. Biomes, Entities and the bounding boxes of structures will persist of not otherwise specified in the NBT Changer.\r\n* `Biome` in the NBT Changer can now be set to `-1` to force Minecraft to regenerate all biomes.\r\n* Filter conditions can now be moved using drag-and-drop.\r\n* Added a text field below the filter editor that shows the current filter as a query that can be used in headless mode. Pasting a query into this text field and pressing `Enter` will also parse the text and display it in the filter editor above.\r\n* Fixed a bug where checking if a filter applies to a region file before opening the file would not work correctly.\r\n* Status in the Chunk Filter and the NBT Changer should validate correctly now using the most recent allowed values.\r\n* Minimized the distributed jar file to exclude unused classes from dependencies.\r\n* Updated Readme with more detailed information on how the filter logic works, see #107.\r\n* Fixed some CSS in group filters. Nested group filters are more visible now and more consistent with the overall look of the other filters.\r\n* Larger-than-or-equal and does-not-contain sign now use the correct unicode character.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Requirements\":\r\n* Either:\r\n  * JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/)\r\n  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation\r\n* A computer\r\n* A brain\r\n\r\n#### If you have Java from Oracle installed on your system\r\n\r\nMost likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard).
