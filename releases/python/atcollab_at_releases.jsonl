However there are still many functions still using `atlinopt`. The transition will be continued,\r\n* 2 new functions `atGetRingProperties` and `atSetRingProperties` handle global lattices parameters (energy, periodicity, particle, harmonic number). They are stored in the optional RingParam lattice element. Its use is now recommended since it avoids lengthy searches when a parameter is requested,\r\n* A new function `atloadlattice` makes reading lattice files easier,\r\n* The default passmethod for cavities is now `RFCavityPass` instead of `CavityPass`. `CavityPass` is still available but should not be used: it is wrong for multi-tune tracking if the RF frequency is not the nominal one.\r\n\r\n## List of changes\r\n* Linopt6 in plots and parameters by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/297\r\n* first look at PolynomB in *LinearPass by @swhite2401 in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/290\r\n* Updated plotAperture by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/313\r\n* Remove the dependency of RFCavityPass on harmonic number by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/319\r\n* Remove the dependency of find_orbit6 on the harmonic number by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/318\r\n* Added optional tolerances in \"TouschekPiwinskiLifeTime\" by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/326\r\n* New README.md file in the docs directory by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/331\r\n* New Lattice properties: energy, harmonic number and particle by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/329\r\n* Fix problems reading .mat files by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/341\r\n* allow fit chrom with radon by @swhite2401 in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/349\r\n* Cavity phase offset arg by @swhite2401 in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/348\r\n* atenergy computes the harmonic number from the RF frequency by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/350\r\n* atsetcavity accepts dp and dct arguments by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/354\r\n* Energy and particle available to C integrators by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/368\r\n* Allow setting \"dp\" in 6D linear optics by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/364\r\n* New Matlab function atloadlattice by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/377\r\n* Add a \"turn\" input to atpass by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/376\r\n* Set the default cavity PassMethod to RFCavityPass by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/372\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fix on atfastring by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/314\r\n* Fit tunes and chromaticities by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/327\r\n* Fix WakeFieldPass in Matlab by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/343\r\n* Fix problems with transfer line mode by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/342\r\n* Fix bug in CavityPass.c by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/358\r\n* Fix WakeElement by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/362\r\n* Fix atplot when energy is undefined by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/375\r\n* Correct bug in plotbetadispcurlyh.m by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/382\r\n* Fix plCorrectorStrength by @lfarv in https://github.com/atcollab/at/pull/392\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/atcollab/at/compare/2.0...2.3", "mentions_count": 2}
