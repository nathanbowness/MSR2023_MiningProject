# ffi-coremidi

#### Realtime MIDI IO with Ruby for OSX

Access the [Apple Core MIDI framework API](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/CACoreMIDIRef/MIDIServices/) with Ruby.

Note that in the interest of allowing people on other platforms to utilize your code, please consider using [UniMIDI](http://github.com/arirusso/unimidi).  UniMIDI is a platform independent wrapper which implements this library and has a similar API.

### Features

* Generalized handling of different MIDI Message types (including SysEx)
* Timestamped input events
* Patch MIDI via software to other programs using IAC
