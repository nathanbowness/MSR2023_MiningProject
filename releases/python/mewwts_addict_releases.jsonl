Hence, the following now happens when you peek on an empty key:\n\n``` Python\nfrom addict import Dict\n>>> a = Dict()\n>>> a.a \n{}\n>>> a\n{}\n```\n\nHowever, calls to `setitem` works just like before:\n\n``` Python\n>>> a.a = 2\n>>> a\n{'a': 2}\n```\n\nThis is possible because of a new implementation detail. Calls to `getitem` now still returns a new addict `Dict`, but this instance have to special keyword arguments `__parent` and `__key` supplied to `__init__`. The `__parent` argument is meant to hold a reference to the `Dict` in which we called `getitem`, and the `__key` argument refers to the key we were peeking on. When, or rather if, this new `Dict` instance's `setitem` method is called, it will _also_ call setitem on it's `__parent` with the key `__key` and the value itself. Let me illustrate with an example.\n\n``` Python\n>>> a = Dict()\n>>> b = a.b\n>>> a\n{}\n>>> b\n{}\n```\n\nAbove, both `a` and `b` are empty `Dicts`. But let's see what happens to `a` when we set an item on `b`\n\n``` Python\n>>> b.c = 2\n>>> b\n{'c': 2}\n>>> a\n{'b': {'c': 2}}\n```\n\nMagic.\n _You should consider these arguments to_ `__init__` _reserved, they will not appear as keys in your `Dict`, and will cause trouble if used in the wrong way._ Example:\n\n``` Python\n>>> a = Dict(__parent=2, __key='a')\n>>> a.v = 2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/Users/mats/dev/mewwts/addict/addict/addict.py\", line 28, in __setattr__\n    self[name] = value\n  File \"/Users/mats/dev/mewwts/addict/addict/addict.py\", line 39, in __setitem__\n    p.__setattr__(key, self)\nAttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'a'\n```\n"}
