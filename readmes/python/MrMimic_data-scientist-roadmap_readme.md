# data-scientist-roadmap

I just found this data science skills roadmap, drew by [Swami Chandrasekaran](http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/) on his cool blog.

Jobs linked to __data science__ are becoming __more and more popular__. A __bunch of tutorials__ could easily complete this roadmap, helping whoever wants to __start learning stuff about data science__.

For the moment, a lot is __got on wikipedia__ (except for codes, always handmade). Any help's thus welcome!

## Rules

* __Feel free to fork this repository and pull requests__.
* Always comment your code.
* Please respect topology for filenames.
* There's one README for each directory.
* Also, could be great to share useful links or resources in README files.
