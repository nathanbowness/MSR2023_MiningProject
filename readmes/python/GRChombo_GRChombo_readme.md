GRChombo is an open-source code for numerical relativity simulations.
It is developed and maintained by a collaboration of numerical relativists with a
wide range of research interests, from early universe cosmology to astrophysics
and mathematical general relativity, and has been used in many papers since its
first release in 2015.

GRChombo is written entirely in C++14, using hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism and
vector intrinsics to achieve good performance on the latest architectures.
Furthermore, it makes use of the Chombo library for adaptive mesh refinement
to allow automatic increasing and decreasing of the grid resolution in regions
of arbitrary shape and topology.

institutions, a list of publications using GRChombo, and some videos.
