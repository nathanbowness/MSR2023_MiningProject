This also improves compatibility\r\n  with split networks as we may not have been able to see the response\r\n  otherwise.  If the responder has not multicast the record recently,\r\n  it may still choose to do so in addition to responding via unicast\r\n\r\n  Reduces traffic when there are multiple zeroconf instances running\r\n  on the network running ServiceBrowsers\r\n\r\n  If we don't get an answer on the first try, we ask a QM question\r\n  in the event, we can't receive a unicast response for some reason\r\n\r\n  This change puts ServiceInfo inline with ServiceBrowser which\r\n  also asks the first question as QU since ServiceInfo is commonly\r\n  called from ServiceBrowser callbacks\r\n* Limited duplicate packet suppression to 1s intervals (#841) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Only suppress duplicate packets that happen within the same\r\n  second.

The limit was reduced to one second to be\r\n  in line with rfc6762\r\n* Made multipacket known answer suppression per interface (#836) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The suppression was happening per instance of Zeroconf instead\r\n  of per interface. Since the same network can be seen on multiple\r\n  interfaces (usually and wifi and ethernet), this would confuse the\r\n  multi-packet known answer supression since it was not expecting\r\n  to get the same data more than once\r\n* New ServiceBrowsers now request QU in the first outgoing when unspecified (#812) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-5.4\r\n  When we start a ServiceBrowser and zeroconf has just started up, the known\r\n  answer list will be small. By asking a QU question first, it is likely\r\n  that we have a large known answer list by the time we ask the QM question\r\n  a second later (current default which is likely too low but would be\r\n  a breaking change to increase). This reduces the amount of traffic on\r\n  the network, and has the secondary advantage that most responders will\r\n  answer a QU question without the typical delay answering QM questions.\r\n* IPv6 link-local addresses are now qualified with scope_id (#343) @ibygrave\r\n\r\n  When a service is advertised on an IPv6 address where\r\n  the scope is link local, i.e. fe80::/64 (see RFC 4007)\r\n  the resolved IPv6 address must be extended with the\r\n  scope_id that identifies through the \"%\" symbol the\r\n  local interface to be used when routing to that address.\r\n  A new API `parsed_scoped_addresses()` is provided to\r\n  return qualified addresses to avoid breaking compatibility\r\n  on the existing parsed_addresses().\r\n* Network adapters that are disconnected are now skipped (#327) @ZLJasonG\r\n* Fixed listeners missing initial packets if Engine starts too quickly (#387) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  When manually creating a zeroconf.Engine object, it is no longer started automatically.\r\n  It must manually be started by calling .start() on the created object.\r\n\r\n  The Engine thread is now started after all the listeners have been added to avoid a\r\n  race condition where packets could be missed at startup.\r\n* Fixed answering matching PTR queries with the ANY query (#618) @bdraco\r\n* Fixed lookup of uppercase names in the registry (#597) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If the ServiceInfo was registered with an uppercase name and the query was\r\n  for a lowercase name, it would not be found and vice-versa.\r\n* Fixed unicast responses from any source port (#598) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Unicast responses were only being sent if the source port\r\n  was 53, this prevented responses when testing with dig:\r\n\r\n    dig -p 5353 @224.0.0.251 media-12.local\r\n\r\n  The above query will now see a response\r\n* Fixed queries for AAAA records not being answered (#616) @bdraco\r\n* Removed second level caching from ServiceBrowsers (#737) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The ServiceBrowser had its own cache of the last time it\r\n  saw a service that was reimplementing the DNSCache and\r\n  presenting a source of truth problem that lead to unexpected\r\n  queries when the two disagreed.\r\n* Fixed server cache not being case-insensitive (#731) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If the server name had uppercase chars and any of the\r\n  matching records were lowercase, and the server would not be\r\n  found\r\n* Fixed cache handling of records with different TTLs (#729) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  There should only be one unique record in the cache at\r\n  a time as having multiple unique records will different\r\n  TTLs in the cache can result in unexpected behavior since\r\n  some functions returned all matching records and some\r\n  fetched from the right side of the list to return the\r\n  newest record. Instead we now store the records in a dict\r\n  to ensure that the newest record always replaces the same\r\n  unique record, and we never have a source of truth problem\r\n  determining the TTL of a record from the cache.\r\n* Fixed ServiceInfo with multiple A records (#725) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If there were multiple A records for the host, ServiceInfo\r\n  would always return the last one that was in the incoming\r\n  packet, which was usually not the one that was wanted.\r\n* Fixed stale unique records expiring too quickly (#706) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Records now expire 1s in the future instead of instant removal.\r\n\r\n  tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#section-10.2\r\n  Queriers receiving a Multicast DNS response with a TTL of zero SHOULD\r\n  NOT immediately delete the record from the cache, but instead record\r\n  a TTL of 1 and then delete the record one second later.  In the case\r\n  of multiple Multicast DNS responders on the network described in\r\n  Section 6.6 above, if one of the responders shuts down and\r\n  incorrectly sends goodbye packets for its records, it gives the other\r\n  cooperating responders one second to send out their own response to\r\n  \"rescue\" the records before they expire and are deleted.\r\n* Fixed exception when unregistering a service multiple times (#679) @bdraco\r\n* Added an AsyncZeroconfServiceTypes to mirror ZeroconfServiceTypes to zeroconf.asyncio (#658) @bdraco\r\n* Fixed interface_index_to_ip6_address not skiping ipv4 adapters (#651) @bdraco\r\n* Added async_unregister_all_services to AsyncZeroconf (#649) @bdraco\r\n* Fixed services not being removed from the registry when calling unregister_all_services (#644) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  There was a race condition where a query could be answered for a service\r\n  in the registry, while goodbye packets which could result in a fresh record\r\n  being broadcast after the goodbye if a query came in at just the right\r\n  time. To avoid this, we now remove the services from the registry right\r\n  after we generate the goodbye packet\r\n* Fixed zeroconf exception on load when the system disables IPv6 (#624) @bdraco\r\n* Fixed the QU bit missing from for probe queries (#609) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The bit should be set per\r\n  datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-8.1\r\n\r\n* Fixed the TC bit missing for query packets where the known answers span multiple packets (#494) @bdraco\r\n* Fixed packets not being properly separated when exceeding maximum size (#498) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Ensure that questions that exceed the max packet size are\r\n  moved to the next packet.

In practice, this is usually due to broken mDNS\r\n  implementations rather than malicious actors.\r\n* Guard against excessive ServiceBrowser queries from PTR records significantly lowerthan recommended (#824) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  We now enforce a minimum TTL for PTR records to avoid\r\n  ServiceBrowsers generating excessive queries refresh queries.\r\n  Apple uses a 15s minimum TTL, however, we do not have the same\r\n  level of rate limit and safeguards, so we use 1/4 of the recommended value.\r\n* RecordUpdateListener now uses async_update_records instead of update_record (#419, #726) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  This allows the listener to receive all the records that have\r\n  been updated in a single transaction such as a packet or\r\n  cache expiry.\r\n\r\n  update_record has been deprecated in favor of async_update_records\r\n  A compatibility shim exists to ensure classes that use\r\n  RecordUpdateListener as a base class continue to have\r\n  update_record called, however, they should be updated\r\n  as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  A new method async_update_records_complete is now called on each\r\n  listener when all listeners have completed processing updates\r\n  and the cache has been updated. This allows ServiceBrowsers\r\n  to delay calling handlers until they are sure the cache\r\n  has been updated as its a common pattern to call for\r\n  ServiceInfo when a ServiceBrowser handler fires.\r\n\r\n  The async\\_ prefix was chosen to make it clear that these\r\n  functions run in the eventloop and should never do blocking\r\n  I/O. Before 0.32+ these functions ran in a select() loop and\r\n  should not have been doing any blocking I/O, but it was not\r\n  clear to implementors that I/O would block the loop.\r\n* Pass both the new and old records to async_update_records (#792) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Pass the old_record (cached) as the value and the new_record (wire)\r\n  to async_update_records instead of forcing each consumer to\r\n  check the cache since we will always have the old_record\r\n  when generating the async_update_records call. This avoids\r\n  the overhead of multiple cache lookups for each listener."}

If you are not accessing zeroconf internals,\r\nyou can likely not be concerned with the breaking changes below:\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: zeroconf.asyncio has been renamed zeroconf.aio (#503) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The asyncio name could shadow system asyncio in some cases. If\r\n  zeroconf is in sys.path, this would result in loading zeroconf.asyncio\r\n  when system asyncio was intended.\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Update internal version check to match docs (3.6+) (#491) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Python version eariler then 3.6 were likely broken with zeroconf\r\n  already, however the version is now explictly checked.\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: RecordUpdateListener now uses async_update_records instead of update_record (#419, #726) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  This allows the listener to receive all the records that have\r\n  been updated in a single transaction such as a packet or\r\n  cache expiry.\r\n\r\n  update_record has been deprecated in favor of async_update_records\r\n  A compatibility shim exists to ensure classes that use\r\n  RecordUpdateListener as a base class continue to have\r\n  update_record called, however they should be updated\r\n  as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  A new method async_update_records_complete is now called on each\r\n  listener when all listeners have completed processing updates\r\n  and the cache has been updated. This allows ServiceBrowsers\r\n  to delay calling handlers until they are sure the cache\r\n  has been updated as its a common pattern to call for\r\n  ServiceInfo when a ServiceBrowser handler fires.\r\n\r\n  The async_ prefix was choosen to make it clear that these\r\n  functions run in the eventloop and should never do blocking\r\n  I/O. Before 0.32+ these functions ran in a select() loop and\r\n  should not have been doing any blocking I/O, but it was not\r\n  clear to implementors that I/O would block the loop.\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Ensure listeners do not miss initial packets if Engine starts too quickly (#387) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  When manually creating a zeroconf.Engine object, it is no longer started automatically.\r\n  It must manually be started by calling .start() on the created object.\r\n\r\n  The Engine thread is now started after all the listeners have been added to avoid a\r\n  race condition where packets could be missed at startup.\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Remove DNSOutgoing.packet backwards compatibility (#569) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  DNSOutgoing.packet only returned a partial message when the\r\n  DNSOutgoing contents exceeded _MAX_MSG_ABSOLUTE or _MAX_MSG_TYPICAL\r\n  This was a legacy function that was replaced with .packets()\r\n  which always returns a complete payload in #248  As packet()\r\n  should not be used since it will end up missing data, it has\r\n  been removed\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Mark DNSOutgoing write functions as protected (#633) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  These functions are not intended to be used by external\r\n  callers and the API is not likely to be stable in the future\r\n\r\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Prefix cache functions that are non threadsafe with async_ (#724) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Adding (`zc.cache.add` -> `zc.cache.async_add_records`), removing (`zc.cache.remove` ->\r\n  `zc.cache.async_remove_records`), and expiring the cache (`zc.cache.expire` ->\r\n  `zc.cache.async_expire`) the cache is not threadsafe and must be called from the\r\n  event loop (previously the Engine select loop before 0.32)\r\n\r\n  These functions should only be run from the event loop as they are NOT thread safe.\r\n\r\n  We never expect these functions will be called externally, however it was possible so this\r\n  is documented as a breaking change.  It is highly recommended that external callers do not\r\n  modify the cache directly.\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Add support for handling QU questions (#621) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Implements RFC 6762 sec 5.4:\r\n  Questions Requesting Unicast Responses\r\n  datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-5.4\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Protect the network against excessive packet flooding (#619) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Suppress additionals when they are already in the answers section (#617) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Avoid including additionals when the answer is suppressed by known-answer supression (#614) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Implement multi-packet known answer supression (#687) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Implements datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-7.2\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Efficiently bucket queries with known answers (#698) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* TRAFFIC REDUCTION: Implement duplicate question supression (#770) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-7.3\r\n\r\n* MAJOR BUG: Ensure matching PTR queries are returned with the ANY query (#618) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* MAJOR BUG: Fix lookup of uppercase names in registry (#597) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If the ServiceInfo was registered with an uppercase name and the query was\r\n  for a lowercase name, it would not be found and vice-versa.\r\n\r\n* MAJOR BUG: Ensure unicast responses can be sent to any source port (#598) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Unicast responses were only being sent if the source port\r\n  was 53, this prevented responses when testing with dig:\r\n\r\n    dig -p 5353 @224.0.0.251 media-12.local\r\n\r\n  The above query will now see a response\r\n\r\n* MAJOR BUG: Fix queries for AAAA records (#616) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add async_apple_scanner example (#719) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add support for requesting QU questions to ServiceBrowser and ServiceInfo (#787) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Ensure the queue is created before adding listeners to ServiceBrowser (#785) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The callback from the listener could generate an event that would\r\n  fire in async context that should have gone to the queue which\r\n  could result in the consumer running a sync call in the event loop\r\n  and blocking it.\r\n\r\n* Add a guard to prevent running ServiceInfo.request in async context (#784) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Inline utf8 decoding when processing incoming packets (#782) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Drop utf cache from _dns (#781) (later reverted) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Switch to using a simple cache instead of lru_cache (#779) (later reverted) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Fix Responding to Address Queries (RFC6762 section 6.2) (#777) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Fix deadlock on ServiceBrowser shutdown with PyPy (#774) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add a guard against the task list changing when shutting down (#776) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Improve performance of parsing DNSIncoming by caching read_utf (#769) (later reverted) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Switch to using an asyncio.Event for async_wait (#759) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  We no longer need to check for thread safety under a asyncio.Condition\r\n  as the ServiceBrowser and ServiceInfo internals schedule coroutines\r\n  in the eventloop.\r\n\r\n* Simplify ServiceBrowser callsbacks (#756) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Revert: Fix thread safety in _ServiceBrowser.update_records_complete (#708) (#755) @bdraco\r\n\r\n- This guarding is no longer needed as the ServiceBrowser loop\r\n  now runs in the event loop and the thread safety guard is no\r\n  longer needed\r\n\r\n* Drop AsyncServiceListener (#754) @bdraco  (Never shipped)\r\n\r\n* Run ServiceBrowser queries in the event loop (#752) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Remove unused argument from AsyncZeroconf (#751) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Fix warning about Zeroconf._async_notify_all not being awaited in sync shutdown (#750) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Update async_service_info_request example to ensure it runs in the right event loop (#749) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Run ServiceInfo requests in the event loop (#748) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Remove support for notify listeners (#733) @bdraco  (Never shipped)\r\n\r\n* Relocate service browser tests to tests/services/test_browser.py (#745) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Relocate ServiceInfo to zeroconf._services.info (#741) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Run question answer callbacks from add_listener in the event loop (#740) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Calling async_update_records and async_update_records_complete should always\r\n  happen in the event loop to ensure implementers do not need to worry about\r\n  thread safety\r\n\r\n* Remove second level caching from ServiceBrowsers (#737) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The ServiceBrowser had its own cache of the last time it\r\n  saw a service which was reimplementing the DNSCache and\r\n  presenting a source of truth problem that lead to unexpected\r\n  queries when the two disagreed.\r\n\r\n* Breakout ServiceBrowser handler from listener creation (#736) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  Add coverage for the handler from listener\r\n\r\n* Add fast cache lookup functions (#732) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  The majority of our lookups happen in the event loop so there is no need\r\n  for them to be threadsafe. Now that the codebase is more clear about what\r\n  needs to be threadsafe and what does not need to be threadsafe we can use\r\n  the much faster non-threadsafe versions in the places where we are calling\r\n  from the event loop.\r\n\r\n* Switch to using DNSRRSet in RecordManager (#735) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  DNSRRSet is able to do O(1) lookups of records assuming\r\n  there are no collisions.\r\n\r\n* Fix server cache to be case-insensitive (#731) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If the server name had uppercase chars and any of the\r\n  matching records were lowercase, the server would not be\r\n  found\r\n\r\n* Fix cache handling of records with different TTLs (#729) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  There should only be one unique record in the cache at\r\n  a time as having multiple unique records will different\r\n  TTLs in the cache can result in unexpected behavior since\r\n  some functions returned all matching records and some\r\n  fetched from the right side of the list to return the\r\n  newest record. Intead we now store the records in a dict\r\n  to ensure that the newest record always replaces the same\r\n  unique record and we never have a source of truth problem\r\n  determining the TTL of a record from the cache.\r\n\r\n* Rename handlers and internals to make it clear what is threadsafe (#726) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  It was too easy to get confused about what was threadsafe and\r\n  what was not threadsafe which lead to unexpected failures.\r\n  Rename functions to make it clear what will be run in the event\r\n  loop and what is expected to be threadsafe\r\n\r\n* Fix ServiceInfo with multiple A records (#725) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  If there were multiple A records for the host, ServiceInfo\r\n  would always return the last one that was in the incoming\r\n  packet which was usually not the one that was wanted.\r\n\r\n* Synchronize time for fate sharing (#718) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Cleanup typing in zero._core and document ignores (#714) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Cleanup typing in zeroconf._logger (#715) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Cleanup typing in zeroconf._utils.net (#713) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Cleanup typing in zeroconf._services (#711) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Cleanup typing in zeroconf._services.registry (#712) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add setter for DNSQuestion to easily make a QU question (#710) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Set stale unique records to expire 1s in the future instead of instant removal (#706) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#section-10.2\r\n  Queriers receiving a Multicast DNS response with a TTL of zero SHOULD\r\n  NOT immediately delete the record from the cache, but instead record\r\n  a TTL of 1 and then delete the record one second later.  In the case\r\n  of multiple Multicast DNS responders on the network described in\r\n  Section 6.6 above, if one of the responders shuts down and\r\n  incorrectly sends goodbye packets for its records, it gives the other\r\n  cooperating responders one second to send out their own response to\r\n  \"rescue\" the records before they expire and are deleted.\r\n\r\n* Fix thread safety in _ServiceBrowser.update_records_complete (#708) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Split DNSOutgoing/DNSIncoming/DNSMessage into zeroconf._protocol (#705) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Abstract DNSOutgoing ttl write into _write_ttl (#695) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Rollback data in one call instead of poping one byte at a time in DNS Outgoing (#696) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Suppress additionals when answer is suppressed (#690) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Move setting DNS created and ttl into its own function (#692) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add truncated property to DNSMessage to lookup the TC bit (#686) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Check if SO_REUSEPORT exists instead of using an exception catch (#682) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Use DNSRRSet for known answer suppression (#680) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  DNSRRSet uses hash table lookups under the hood which\r\n  is much faster than the linear searches used by\r\n  DNSRecord.suppressed_by\r\n\r\n* Add DNSRRSet class for quick hashtable lookups of records (#678) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  This class will be used to do fast checks to see\r\n  if records should be suppressed by a set of answers.\r\n\r\n* Allow unregistering a service multiple times (#679) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Remove unreachable BadTypeInNameException check in _ServiceBrowser (#677) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Update async_browser.py example to use AsyncZeroconfServiceTypes (#665) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add an AsyncZeroconfServiceTypes to mirror ZeroconfServiceTypes to zeroconf.aio (#658) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Remove all calls to the executor in AsyncZeroconf (#653) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Set __all__ in zeroconf.aio to ensure private functions do now show in the docs (#652) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Ensure interface_index_to_ip6_address skips ipv4 adapters (#651) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Add async_unregister_all_services to AsyncZeroconf (#649) @bdraco\r\n\r\n* Ensure services are removed from the registry when calling unregister_all_services (#644) @bdraco\r\n\r\n  There was a race condition where a query could be answered for a service\r\n  in the registry while goodbye packets which could result a fresh record\r\n  being broadcast after the goodbye if a query came in at just the right\r\n  time.
