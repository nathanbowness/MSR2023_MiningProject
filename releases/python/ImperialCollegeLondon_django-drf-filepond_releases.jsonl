If you are working with very large files and your upload chunk size is set too small, you could encounter an issue where the number of chunks is greater than 2**31. However, depending on the filesystem you are using you may also reach filesystem limits before this occurs. It is recommended that you consider the most suitable balance between chunk size and the largest file uploads you'll need to handle. Chunk size is set on the filepond client via the [server properties](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#server)."}
