In conjuction with MemHierarchy, MacSim can be configured with DRAMSim2 or VaultSim.\n\nNote - Use \"USE_MEMHIERARCHY' knob to use MemHierarchy cache. With it turned off, MacSim doesn't interact with other component at all. It works as if MacSim-standalone, but on top of SST framework.\n"}

(The svn repository already has the latest version.)**\n1. MacSim's Trace Format has been changed along with the trace configuration file format. For verification purposes, a few sample traces conforming to the new trace file format are included in this release. For your convenience, more x86 sample traces from spec2006 will also be provided.\n   - To make sure your installation is complete (./build.py), please go check using $MACSIM_ROOT/bin/macsim binary. It searches for newly built executable and runs traces listed in trace_file_list to completion.\n   - Please download sample traces provided in googlecode page and extract them under $MACSIM_ROOT/trace/ directory. You may need to modify trace_file_list to run more traces other than the included ones.\n2. MacSim is now compatible with Mac OS X.\n   - We resolved a few compilation issues that arises with Mac environment.\n   - Please note that only g++-4.7 is fully tested and other versions of compilers are not yet fully supported.\n3. Added SST-3.0.0 compatibility\n   - There have been a lot of changes made to SST framework (The Structural Simulation Toolkit developed by Sandia National Laboratory) since its last release. We have made a transition from an older version of SST APIs to a newer version to make it compatible with SST-3.0.0.\n"}
