Case Recommender is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback. The framework aims to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a set of algorithms. Case Recommender has different types of item recommendation and rating prediction approaches, and different metrics validation and evaluation.

# Algorithms

Item Recommendation:

- BPRMF

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Group-based (Clustering-based algorithm)

- Paco Recommender (Co-Clustering-based algorithm)

- Most Popular

- Random

- Content Based

Rating Prediction:

- Matrix Factorization (with and without baseline)

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization

- SVD

- SVD++

- ItemKNN

- Item Attribute KNN

- UserKNN

- User Attribute KNN

- Item NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- User NSVD1 (with and without Batch)

- Most Popular

- Random

- gSVD++

- Item-MSMF

- (E) CoRec

Clustering:

- PaCo: EntroPy Anomalies in Co-Clustering

- k-medoids

# Evaluation and Validation Metrics

- All-but-one Protocol

- Cross-fold-Validation

- Item Recommendation: Precision, Recall, NDCG and Map

- Rating Prediction: MAE and RMSE

- Statistical Analysis (T-test and Wilcoxon)

# Requirements

- Python
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

# Installation

Case Recommender can be installed using pip:

    $ pip install caserecommender

If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from git:

    $ pip install -U git+git://github.com/caserec/CaseRecommender.git

# Quick Start and Guide

# Usage

Divide Database (Fold Cross Validation)

    >> from caserec.utils.split_database import SplitDatabase
    >> SplitDatabase(input_file=dataset, dir_folds=dir_path, n_splits=10).k_fold_cross_validation()

Run Item Recommendation Algorithm (E.g: ItemKNN)

    >> from caserec.recommenders.item_recommendation.itemknn import ItemKNN
    >> ItemKNN(train_file, test_file).compute()

Run Rating Prediction Algorithm (E.g: ItemKNN)

    >> from caserec.recommenders.rating_prediction.itemknn import ItemKNN
    >> ItemKNN(train_file, test_file).compute()

Evaluate Ranking (Prec@N, Recall@N, NDCG@, Map@N and Map Total)

    >> from caserec.evaluation.item_recommendation import ItemRecommendationEvaluation
    >> ItemRecommendationEvaluation().evaluate_with_files(predictions_file, test_file)

Evaluate Ranking (MAE and RMSE)

    >> from caserec.evaluation.rating_prediction import RatingPredictionEvaluation
    >> RatingPredictionEvaluation().evaluate_with_files(predictions_file, test_file)

# Input

The input-files of traditional have to be placed in the corresponding subdirectory and are in csv-format with at least
3 columns. Example: user_1,item_1,feedback
