Construct
=========

Construct is a powerful declarative parser for binary data.

It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative
manner, rather than procedural code: Simple constructs can be combined
hierarchically to form increasingly complex data structures. It's the first
library that makes parsing fun, instead of the usual headache it is today.

Construct features bit and byte granularity, symmetrical operation (parsing
and building), component-oriented declarative design, easy debugging and
testing, an easy-to-extend subclass system, and lots of primitive
constructs to make your work easier:

 * Fields
 * Structs
 * Unions
 * Repeaters
 * Meta constructs
 * Switches
 * On-demand parsing
 * Pointers
 * And more!

Requirements
============

Construct should run on any Python 2.5+ implementation. It has no external
dependencies.
