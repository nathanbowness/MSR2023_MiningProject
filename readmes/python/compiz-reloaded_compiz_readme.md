# compiz â€“ OpenGL window and compositing manager

Futher development of Compiz 0.8.x series (compiz-reloaded).

Compiz is an OpenGL compositing manager that uses
GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap for binding redirected top-level
windows to texture objects. It has a flexible plug-in system and it
is designed to run well on most graphics hardware.
