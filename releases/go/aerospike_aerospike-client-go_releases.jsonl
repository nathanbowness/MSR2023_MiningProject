As a result, the client may fail to refresh its session token after it expires, requiring the client to be restarted. If you are using password-based authentication, we highly recommend that you upgrade your client to version 5.6.0+, which you can do safely.\r\n\r\n  This is a major feature release. It is also a major breaking release. We have adopted Go's module system as recommended by the Go authors, so the new release moves the active branch to `v5`.\r\n  As such, the import path changes to `github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go/v5`. The `master` branch remains in place to allow maintenance for the older v4 classic version until most users\r\n  get the chance to upgrade.\r\n\r\n  This release also changes the way errors work in the client, and invalidates the old way. This allows the client to support Go's somewhat new `errors.Is` and `errors.As` API, and properly\r\n  chain errors together.\r\n\r\n  Also note that the Go Client now requires server version 4.9+ and will not work properly with older versions.\r\n\r\n  * **New Features**\r\n\r\n    - Adopts module system and changes the import paths to `github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go/v5`\r\n    - [CLIENT-1476] Support new expressions introduced in server version 5.6, including `ExpReadOp` and `ExpWriteOp`.\r\n    - [CLIENT-1463] Support boolean particle type and make it opt-in for reflection API via `UseNativeBoolTypeInReflection`.\r\n    - [CLIENT-1522] Support user quotas and statistics.\r\n    - [CLIENT-1492] Remove ability to use old authentication protocol. This works behind the scenes and doesn't have any impact on user code.\r\n    - [CLIENT-1081] Adds `Error` interface, changes all API signature to return `Error`.\r\n    - Exports `AdminCommand` and its `QueryXXX` API.\r\n\r\n  * **Breaking Changes**\r\n    - Limits keys to `int`, `string` and `[]byte` types. The old `ListValue` arrays as types are not supported anymore.\r\n    - Remove TLS code support for golang v1.8 and before.\r\n    - Moves `AerospikeError` from `/types` to the root of the package, and removes all other error type like `NodeError`\r\n    - [CLIENT-1526] Removes `Policy.Priority`, `ScanPolicy.ScanPercent` and `ScanPolicy.FailOnClusterChange`\r\n    - Removes `Recordset.Read()` and avoids multiplexing of `Records` channel in `Recordset.Results()`, and unexports the `Error` channel.\r\n    - Remove legacy client code for old servers. Go client now requires server version 4.9+\r\n    - Remove `Statement.PredExp`, and only use the `Policy.PredExp` to avoid confusion. `PredExp` has been deprecated and replaced by `Expression`.\r\n    - Renames type `FilterExpression` to `Expression`.\r\n    - `Client.GetBatchXXX()` will return `ErrFilteredOut` if an expression is passed to the API and some records were filtered out, regardless of `BatchPolicy.AllowPartialResults`.\r\n    - `Client.CreateRole()` now requires quota information in the param list.\r\n    - Removed `Connection.Authenticate()` API.\r\n    - Renamed `GetOpForBin()` to `GetBinOp()`\r\n    - Removed `ScanPolicy.ConcurrentNodes`. Now only uses `.MaxConcurrentNodes` to avoid confusion.\r\n    - Moves the `RequestInfo()` under `Connection`.\r\n\r\n  * **Improvements**\r\n\r\n    - Implement `GomegaStringer` interface to prevent very long error messages in tests.\r\n    - Adds `ResultCode.String()`.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aerospike/aerospike-client-go/releases/42779753/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Now it returns `ErrKeyNotFound` error.\r\n> This is a significant change, and you should search your code for all instances of `.Bins == nil` (or equivalent) and adapt the code accordingly.\r\n  \r\n  * **Major Changes And Improvements**:\r\n    - Optimizes connection creation out of the transaction pipeline and makes it async.\r\n    - Puts a threshold on the number of connections allowed to open simultaneously. Controlled via `ClientPolicy.OpeningConnectionThreshold`.\r\n    - Do not clear partition map entry when a node reports that it no longer owns that partition entry.\r\n    - Uses rolling timeout instead of strict timeout for connections. This means that every time a connection is read, the timeout is set to `policy.SocketTimeout` again, unless it will take longer than the whole transaction `TotalTimeout`.\r\n    - Remove `ToValueArray` and `ToValueSlice` methods to discourage such sub-optimal use. Changes `QueryAggregate` signature to remove the need for those methods.\r\n    - Remove unnecessary conversion from `BinMap` to `Bin`s in reflection API to speed up the command and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.\r\n    - Use shorter intervals with exponential back-off for tasks.\r\n\r\n  * **Breaking Changes**:\r\n    - `Get`/`Put`/`Touch`/`Operate` and `ExecuteUDF` commands will return an `ErrKeyNotFound` error when the key does not exist in the database. The old behavior used to be not to return an error, but have an empty `Record.Bins`.\r\n    - Renames `Statement.Addfilter` to `Statement.SetFilter`, changes the name and type of `Statement.Filters` to `Statement.Filter`.\r\n    - Remove `ClientPolicy.RequestProleReplicas`. The client will always request them.\r\n    - Removes `ScanPolicy.ServerSocketTimeout` and `QueryPolicy.ServerSocketTimeout` in favor of the already existing `Policy.SocketTimeout`.\r\n    - Renames `Policy.Timeout` to `Policy.TotalTimeout` to make the naming consistent with other clients.\r\n    - Moves `atomic` package to internal.\r\n    - Moves `ParticleType` package to internal.\r\n    - Moves `RequestNodeInfo` and `RequestNodeStats` to methods on Node object, and adds `InfoPolicy` to the relevant API signatures.\r\n    - Removes `WaitUntilMigrationIsFinished` from `Scan`/`Query` policies.\r\n    - Changes `NewConnection` method signature\r\n    - Makes `LoginCommand` private.\r\n    - Makes `OperationType` private.\r\n    - Remove long deprecated method for pool management.\r\n    - Removes unused `ReadN` method in `Connection`.\r\n    - Embeds Policies as values and not pointers inside `MultiPolicy`, `ScanPolicy`, `QueryPolicy`\r\n\r\n  * **Minor Improvements and Fixes**:\r\n    - Fixes a race condition in the `AdminCommand`.\r\n    - Synchronize the `XORShift` to avoid race conditions.\r\n    - Completely removes deprecated LDT code."}

If set to true, the client won't attemp to create new connections to the node if the total number of pooled connections to the node is equal or more than the pool size. The client will retry to poll a connection from the queue until a timeout occures. If no timeout is set, it will only retry for ten times.\n- **Improvements**\n  - BREAKING CHANGE: |\n                    Uses type aliases instead of structs in several XXXValue methods. This removes a memory allocation per `Value` usage.\n                    Since every `Put` operation uses at list one value object, this has the potential to improve application performance.\n                    Since the signature of several `NewXXXValue` methods have changed, this might break some existing code if you have used the value objects directly.\n  - Improved `Logger` so that it will accept a generalized `Logger` interface. Any Logger with a `Printf(format string, values ...interface{})` method can be used. Examples include Logrus.\n  - Improved `Client.BatchGet()` performance.\n- **Fixes**\n  - Bin names were ignored in BatchCommands.\n  - `BatchCommandGet.parseRecord()` returned wrong values when `BinNames` was empty but not nil.\n"}
