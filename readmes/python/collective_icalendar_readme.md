Versions and Compatibility
--------------------------

``icalendar`` is a critical project used by many. It has been there for a long time and maintaining
long-term compatibility with projects conflicts partially with providing and using the features that
the latest Python versions bring.

Since we pour more `effort into maintaining and developing icalendar <https://github.com/collective/icalendar/discussions/360>`__,
we split the project into two:

- `Branch 4.x <https://github.com/collective/icalendar/tree/4.x>`__ with maximum compatibility to Python versions ``2.7`` and ``3.4+``, ``PyPy2`` and ``PyPy3``.
- `Branch master <https://github.com/collective/icalendar/>`__ with the compatibility to Python versions ``3.7+`` and ``PyPy3``.

We expect the ``master`` branch with versions ``5+`` receive the latest updates and features,
and the ``4.x`` branch the subset of security and bug fixes only.
We recommend migrating to later Python versions and also providing feedback if you depend on the ``4.x`` features.
