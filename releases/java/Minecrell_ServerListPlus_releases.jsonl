I have rewritten some of the most important parts of the plugin to allow for the new features in this release so there _might be bugs_, however it should be stable enough already.\n- **Added [Virtual Hosts](https://github.com/Minecrell/ServerListPlus/wiki/Virtual-Hosts).** Depending on the IP/Domain the player used to ping the server you can add custom information in your server status ping, for example for a special gamemode on your server. This can be used together with BungeeCord's [Forced Hosts](https://github.com/Minecrell/ServerListPlus/wiki/Virtual-Hosts#bungeecord).\n- **Completed all missing Wiki pages.**\n- Improved placeholder performance, however this change was breaking for the Replacement API. If you have plugins using it please [update them to the new API](https://github.com/Minecrell/ServerListPlus/wiki/API#replacement-api).\n- Fixed a bug preventing you from using the `%online@server%` placeholders multiple times on a line.\n- Fixed displaying the custom player slot format to outdated clients. They will now see the original outdated version again.\n- Added `%online@world%` placeholder for Bukkit/Spigot servers.\n- Removed required dependency on ProtocolLib, however without the plugin will be very limited in features, only descriptions (MotD), favicons, and the maximum player count is changable without ProtocolLib. I have looked into removing the dependency completely however, this is simply not worth the effort because it won't be faster and will just break the plugin in the future.\n- Removed `ServerListPlus.log` file in favour of the server log files.\n- Improved all commands and added tab completion.\n- Various fixes and stability / performance improvements.\n"}

Take a look at the [rewritten wiki page](https://github.com/Minecrell/ServerListPlus/wiki/Favicons#player-heads) to see how to configure them.\n- Added support for more favicon formats: `JPG`, `PNG`, `BMP`, `GIF` (not animated - client side limitation)\n- Scale favicons that are not 64x64 pixels big.\n- Added ranges for maximum player count, single numbers are still possible - one number will be chosen randomly from the range:\n  \n  ``` yaml\n  Players:\n    Max:\n    # Single numbers do still work\n    - 5\n    - 7\n    # Range from 1 to 10\n    - 1..10\n  ```\n- Added direct support to hide the player count without the problems of the custom slots.
