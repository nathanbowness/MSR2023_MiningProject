Submodules are released independently (we will keep these versions in-sync) to allow for vendering exactly the protocol required, and nothing else.\r\n- This release includes support for the following protocol options:\r\n  - http\r\n  - gochan\r\n  - pubsub\r\n  - nats\r\n  - stan\r\n  - amqp\r\n  - kafka\r\n- Added HTTP retries.\r\n- Added initial HTTP webhook abuse protection support (feature not complete).\r\n- Reworked the CloudEventReader/Writer interfaces.\r\n- Removed the `transport` interfaces, (replaced with a combination of `bindings` and `protocol`).\r\n- Introduced `protocol.Result`, a wrapper on error that allows for more information to be bubbled up to integrators.\r\n- Many many many bug fixes.\r\n- So many perf improvements.\r\n\r\nAnd additional details can be found on our docs site: https://cloudevents.github.io/sdk-go/\r\n\r\nA BIG *thank you* to anyone and everyone who has submitted a feature, bug fix, PR, issue, or left a comment in Slack. We are trying to provide a rock solid SDK that works for everyone with minimal dependencies. If you find an issue, please reach out or file an issue and we will work to resolve it. v2 comes with many API breaking changes from v1, and we are sorry for that, but the API is in a much better state than it was 6 months ago. It was a ton of fun and a ton of work. \r\n\r\nWe will be following strict semver with this major milestone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\nThe long path to v2.0.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC5\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC4\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC3\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC2\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview8\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview7\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview6\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview5\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview4\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview3\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview2\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview1\r\n"}

This is a preview release.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the Go SDK v2 is to give more control to the integrators. This is very true for middleware, where you might want to have more control over the underlying transport lib and need less fancy features from this SDK. The second goal is to reduce the complexity of the SDK by not plumbing so many features through the client interface for overrides. This control should happen in your code if it is needed. So the client interface is geared towards event producers and consumers. The protocol layer is targeted towards the middleware writers.\r\n\r\nThere are many changes to Preview,\r\n\r\n- New Send/Request interface in Client.\r\n- A few client features have been dropped with an aim for reducing the complexity of the SDK by encouraging direct management of the underlying protocol and using a Protocol object that helps encode/decode Events\r\n- New shape for building Event. \r\n  - Drop event.Data\r\n  - Add event.SetData(contentType, object), forcing a content type to be set. \r\n- transport.Codec has been dropped in favor of Bindings and the ToEvent, WriteXX methods.\r\n- New object called Protocol, used to do the 3rd party interactions to message conversions and back.\r\n    - Protocol ends up implementing transport.Sender, transport.Receiver, transport.Responder, and transport.Requester, as applicable.\r\n- ... and many more changes that will be details in the final docs. Some of these are API breaking changes. \r\n\r\nAll the samples have been updated to use the new interfaces.\r\n\r\nTo be done:\r\n\r\n- Final docs for new shapes.\r\n- More samples to show integration at a more basic level. (like just json, or just Protocol)\r\n- Rework client<->transport interactions.\r\n- Reworking the transport.Transport interface. This is not yet final. It will be reworked. \r\n- Add/confirm trace extension work is not lost in the migration.\r\n- Re-Add Pub/Sub support. (needs to be reworked in the new bindings format)\r\n  \r\n"}

The errors list is exported if you need to edit it directly (for a mix of builder methods and direct setting to fix issues)\r\n\r\n**With v1.0.0:**\r\n\r\nThe API that exists under [`pkg/cloudevents`](/pkg/cloudevents) will follow\r\nsemver rules. This applies to the root [`./alias.go`](/alias.go) file as well.\r\n\r\nEven though `pkg/cloudevents` is v1.0.0, there could still be minor bugs and\r\nperformance issues. We will continue to track and fix these issues as they come\r\nup. Please file a pull request or issue if you experience problems.\r\n\r\nThe API that exists under [`pkg/bindings`](/pkg/bindings) is a new API that\r\nwill become SDK v2.x, and will replace `pkg/cloudevents`. This area is still\r\nunder heavy development and will not be following the same semver rules as\r\n`pkg/cloudevents`. If a release is required to ship changes to `pkg/bindings`, a\r\nbug fix release will be issued (x.y.z+1).\r\n\r\nWe will target ~2 months of development to release v2 of this SDK with an end\r\ndate of March 27, 2020. You can read more about the plan for SDK v2 in the\r\n[SDK v2 planning doc](/docs/SDK_v2.md)."}

Previously extensions were defined in an extensions map, which was itself a top level property. All CloudEvent properties can be accessed using the generic Get method, or the type checked versions, e.g. GetString, GetMap, etc., but only the well known properties allow for direct field access. The marshallers handle packing and unpacking the extensions into an internal map.\r\n\r\nThis release also makes significant changes to the CloudEvent property names. All property names on the wire are now lower case with no separator characters. This ensures that these names are recognized across transports, which have different standards for property names. This release also removes the redundant 'event' prefix on property names. So EventType becomes Type and EventID become ID, etc. One special case is CloudEventsVersion, which becomes SpecVersion."}
