Also fix one related UI bug\r\n* Merge #1266\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* New feature: NTP client\r\n  - Located in the \"miscellaneous\" Rosalina submenu, this fetches the time from time1.google.com (hardcoded IP) by default\r\n  - This sets the config savefile RTC offset 0, hence the displayed by Home Menu will also be the time that Arm9 programs like GM9 will see\r\n  - Consequently, Luma3DS's own Arm9 code will properly set the date and time when modifying or creating new files\r\n* New feature: blue light filters (thanks to @panicbit, #1065)\r\n* Lots of cheat engine bugfixes and improvements thanks to @piepie62 (multiple PRs), in addition to @tstambaugh92 's bugfixes (#1116, #1117)\r\n  - most CTRPF-AR code types now supported\r\n  - more cheats can be loaded at once\r\n* New reimplemented sysmodule: pm\r\n  - Number of max. pm:dbg sessions increased for Rosalina usage\r\n  - New pm:dbg commands: GetCurrentAppTitleIdAndPid, DebugNextApplicationByForce, LaunchTitleDebug (mainly for gdbstub usage)\r\n  - Debug restrictions lifted for the gdbstub\r\n  - Service restrictions lifted for Cubic Ninja\r\n* Lots of gdbstub improvements:\r\n  - Added support for debugging application at their very start (new option in Debugger submenu)\r\n  - Added support for `target extended-remote`\r\n    - You do not need to select a process to attach to in process list anymore using this, although it still works absolutely fine \r\n    - You will see a nice process list in IDA\r\n    - When launching new processes: only `titleId [mediaType [launchFlags]]` is supported, and the launched title shouldn't rely on APT and all 3 parameters should be hex-encoded (see e11cc090b27266e922db76cb7a7850d67bda8f18)\r\n  - Added support for accessing host files (including stdin/stdio/stderr) from target 3DS programs. Support for it has been added in libctru\r\n  - Added support for accessing target SD-card files from the host (`remote put`, `remote get` and `remote delete`)\r\n  - Doubled packet size\r\n  - Many bugfixes\r\n* Fixed critical bugs in sm: one causing a crash when launching the camera applet when another title was using the camera, another possibly affecting sleep mode\r\n* Fixed a critical bug where Luma3DS's Arm9 code would spam I2C requests, causing some particular commits of popular Arm9 payloads to fail on New3DS units with IPS screens.\r\nIf the issue still arises, put multiple payloads in the folder and use the chainloader menu to work around it\r\n* Reworked build system. **Armips is no longer required**.\r\n* Always dump errdisp errors to `/luma/errdisp.txt`\r\n* Upgraded FatFs to R0.13c\r\n* Upgraded I2C driver in Arm9 code\r\n* Fix screens not working on firmlaunch, firmlaunch errors will now be displayed on screen\r\n* Patch 11.8+ NIM-related Process9 to send all-zero key and IV when the UNITINFO patch is enabled (thanks to @luigoalma, #1142)\r\n* Hide EmuNAND options when there is no EmuNAND present on the console\r\n* Fix minor bugs involving DS(i) title autoloading\r\n* Many other bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Note: the pm reimplementation currently breaks NTR CFW to some extent (in particular game plugins). The abandoned \"NTR CFW\" is now unsupported, even if it may work.\r\n  * A solution for future versions is being worked on.\r\n  * It may be possible to change NTR CFW source code for it not to inject itself into pm, since Luma3DS removes svc permission checks anyway, to mitigate the issue. We do not have the time to do that ourselves\r\n  * It is not possible to disable custom pm\r\n  \r\nIn addition, with thanks to @fincs, this release of Luma3DS comes bundled with version 2.1.0 of the [Homebrew Menu](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/18309108/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

the Rosalina debugger (thanks @Nanquitas)\r\n- Added RAM viewer/editor/dumper feature to Rosalina (thanks @LiquidFenrir)\r\n- Rosalina now cleanly reboots the console when the option is selected\r\n- Fixed Rosalina screenshots for RGB5_A1/RGBA4 framebuffer formats (used for example in Virtual Console titles)\r\n- Stubbed isTitleAllowed to allow Nintendo-blocked titles to launch (outdated Ironfall/Flipnote Studio 3D/etc)\r\n- ARM9 exheader and FS patches are now always applied as they cause no drawbacks\r\n- Throw an error if file writes or emuNAND boot are attempted while the SD card is write-locked\r\n- Display boot source on the bottom screen in the config menu\r\n- The console will now shutdown when the shell is closed in the Luma menus, unless the user booted via ntrboot\r\n- Numerous Exception Handler fixes\r\n- FatFS updated to v0.13\r\n- Check if NWM is running before allowing WiFi toggling in Rosalina\r\n- Screenshots are now sorted by date/time using osGetTime, removing the counting delay if the user has a lot of screenshots, thanks to @Hayleia!\r\n\r\n**Note: BootNTR is broken in this version, unless you use the latest ~~commit, not~~ release from this repo: https://github.com/Nanquitas/BootNTR**\r\n\r\n**Edit (20/12/17 18:28 EST):** BootNTR Selector v2.10 has been released with support for Luma v9.0, you can now use the latest release instead of needing to manually compile the latest commit!\r\n\r\n**Notes on the changes made to Rosalina's debugger:**\r\n- The physical memory access \"bit31\" mapping (0--0x30000000 => 0x80000000--0xB0000000) as well as privileged (kernel) mappings confuse debugger clients like IDA's which interpret the value of the registers. Access to those mappings can be toggled using \"monitor toggleextmemaccess\" instead (issue reported by @Nanquitas).\r\n- Additionally, support for the buggy IDA 6.8 gdb client was removed. Please use IDA 7.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n**P.S:** IDA 7.0 added client support for no-ack mode (Debugging options > Set specific options), which should be enabled to make debugging twice as smooth. \"Use stepping support\" should be unchecked."}

This is slow but it works\r\n    * Other various options, see below\r\n    * A display of the remaining battery percentage in the bottom right of the screen, and of the Luma3DS commit at the bottom left\r\n* **Input redirection**:\r\n    * Implementation thanks to @Stary2001, based off the work of ShinyQuagsire\r\n    * Allows you to control your 3DS using your PC with, for example, an external controller (Xbox360 controller, etc.)\r\n    * Should work with every game with minimal lag\r\n    * C-stick/ZL/ZR redirection is N3DS-only, possibly only with newer games\r\n    * Use [this client](https://github.com/TuxSH/InputRedirectionClient-Qt/releases) (compatible with xinput on Windows, evdev on Linux, should be compatible with OSX) or [that one](https://github.com/Stary2001/InputClient-SDL)\r\n    * If you activate this feature in Home Menu, applications will be prevented to disconnect the 3DS from the Internet while they're running. This takes effect until the next boot\r\n* **3DSX loading**:\r\n    * Thanks to @fincs\r\n    * 3DSX files can now be loaded seamlessly, _and work just like installed titles_ (meaning you can use the Home Menu and applets while a 3DSX application is running, use the GDB stub (see below), etc.)!\r\n    * No need for *hax payloads anymore!\r\n    * By default, the title used to boot `boot.3dsx` is hblauncher_loader, but this can be changed at any time (Miscellaneous options > Switch the hb. title to the current app.) : simply launch any title, use that option, close the title ; the next time you launch that title, it will run `boot.3dsx`\r\n    * *hax payloads don't work anymore. **You'll have to use version of the Homebrew Menu >= 2.0, which can be found [here](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases) (and in the homebrew starter pack later on)**\r\n* Better **language emulation**:\r\n    * Language (and region) emulation should now work for all games\r\n    * You can now specify a country (2 letter code) and a state ID (2-digit hex integer), for example: `EUR FR FR 01`\r\n* A fully-featured **GDB stub**:\r\n    * Network code and skeleton thanks to @Stary2001\r\n    * Can debug up to 3 processes simultaneously (the process to attach to are to be selected in the process list menu)\r\n        * Use the process menu when the debugger is enabled to select processes to attach to.\r\n    * Use `-lctrud` and `-lcitro3dd` instead of `-lctru` and `-lcitro3d`, `-Og` instead of `-O2`, drop `-fomit-frame-pointer` build debug versions of your own applications. \r\n    * Compatible with both GDB and IDA PRO: \r\n        * The GDB stub requires a patched version of GDB to work, available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/) (3ds-gdb-* archives), _which will get eventually integrated into devkitARM itself_.\r\n        * The GDB stubs also works with IDA (`Use single-step support`, in the specific debugger options prompt, should be unchecked). \r\n    * Software breakpoints, 2 hardware watchpoints (globally), all basic features and many more, like `catch syscall`, `info os`, etc.\r\n    * Can access the `80000000..B0000000` strongly ordered mapping (see below) as well as privileged memory\r\n    * If you activate this feature in Home Menu, applications will be prevented to disconnect the 3DS from the Internet while they're running. This takes effect until the next boot\r\n    \r\nNow for some developer/technical details:\r\n\r\n* A \"kernel extension\" extending the features of Kernel11 ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0):\r\n    * New features for existing SVCs, for example:\r\n        * New types for `svcGetProcessInfo`: 0x10000 to get a process's name, 0x10001 to get a process's title ID, 0x10002 to 0x10007 for section attributes, 0x10008 for TTBR1, etc.\r\n        * New types for `svcGetSystemInfo`: 0x10000 for CFW info, 0x10001 for N3DS-related info, 0x10002 for TTBCR and TTBR0 per core, etc. \r\n        * New types for `svcGetThreadInfo`: 0x10000 for thread local storage\r\n        * Many other changes not listed here\r\n    * New SVCs:\r\n        * See `csvc.h` ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\r\n        * Indirect SVC: `svc 0xFE`\r\n    * Debug features:\r\n        * SVC permission checks don't exist anymore\r\n        * Everything behaves as if the \"Allow debug\" kernel flags was always set, and `svcKernelSetState` as well as the official debug handlers always believe that the unit is a development one. This is needed for the below item\r\n        * No need to do `svcKernelSetState(6, 1, 1LL)` for user-specified exception handlers anymore.\r\n        * Numerous fixes of Luma3DS's fatal exception handlers. Moreover, they are now only used either on privileged-mode crashes or when there is no preferred alternative, that are namely: KDebug based-debugging, or user-defined exception handlers.\r\n    * New memory mapping: `PA 00000000..30000000 -> VA 80000000..B0000000 [ Priv: RWX, User: RWX ] [ Shared, Strongly Ordered ]` (accessible from the GDB stub)\r\n    * Because of memory issues, `ErrDisp` is not launched; `err:f` has been reimplemented.\r\n\r\nMinor issues: the menu can sometime freeze in some games (that will be attempted to be fixed before next release), versions < 9.0 haven't been tested. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Luma is now a proper FIRM with separate arm11, arm9 and modules sections\r\n* Switched to a whitelist for FIRM loading\r\n* It's now possible to boot newer DS flashcarts (the ones appearing in the original DS' main menu) and early DSi flashcarts directly from Home Menu\r\n* Luma now works with NANDs using custom NCSDs/MBRs\r\n* \"Enable exception handlers\" was removed, since it's always on with Rosalina choosing the best exception reporting method depending on the context \r\n* Luma can now boot on its own as FIRM0/1 (although note this is not recommended or supported _at all_ and we _very strongly_ recommend using boot9strap)"}

Compatibility should be really good as only two games have been reported as being not working out of all the reports (due to the unusual way they were compiled). To use it, you will need to copy romfs files (following the romfs folder structure) to `/luma/titles/<titleID>/romfs/`.

Common pre-patched titles include NS, Home Menu, TWL_FIRM and AGB_FIRM (in these cases you will either get a svcBreak in loader or a shutdown when launching DS/GBA games). Clean versions of these titles need to be reinstalled before upgrading (the wiki will be updated with a walkthrough soon\u2122).**\n"}

To have a custom path you can now enable the option for it in the configuration and type it in a `/luma/path.txt` file, it must start with a `/`. This path is also picked up by the above mentioned .dat chainloader.\n- A full format of the SD card is no longer necessary to remove an EmuNAND (also fixes crashes when trying to boot EmuNAND with an SD which used to have one and wasn't fully formatted).\n- The splash screens now display all at once thanks to the alternate framebuffer support.\n- Fixed screen weirdnesses when not launching from arm9loaderhax.\n- Added support for text files with a trailing newline (as per UNIX convention) for region/language emulation and custom versions.\n- Fixed loading SafeA9LHInstaller and other payloads which need the OTP hash if having a PIN.\n- Slightly changed the PIN format.\n- Made option descriptions more readable.\n- Fixed non-working double newlines in PIN messages.\n- Fixed hangs on errors after a firmlaunch, reboots now happen as expected.\n- bin2c is no longer needed to compile.\n\n_Reuploaded to fix a confusing typo in the config_\n"}

If you want to launch a 3.x or 4.x NAND, you have to place a recent enough firmware.bin (corresponding 10.x for example) under the luma folder (this is not a new feature)\n- Conversely, firmware.bin support has been removed when booting a >= 6.x NAND. \"SysNAND is updated (A9LH-only)\" has been renamed to \"Use SysNAND FIRM if booting with R (A9LH)\" to reflect its only new purpose\n  - If you were using firmware.bin solely for BootNTR, update the latter (BootNTR has been updated to support 11.0)\n- Add support for loading titles' code section from `/luma/code_sections/<titleID>.bin` (this is useful for homebrew like SaltySD)\n- Enable the reboot patch on 9.0/9.1/9.2 FIRM\n- Implement a PIN-checking system: you can set a 4-key combinaison (using A, B, X and Y) that be checked when Luma3DS is launched (thanks to @reworks)\n  - If you want to change your PIN, unselect the corresponding option in the configuration menu, save your configuration settings, then set that option again \n- The screens' brightness is now updated \"interactively\" when the corresponding option in the configuration menu is changed. This works even if the screen has been initied before Luma3DS has started running\n- Replace \"Enable splash screen with no screen-init\" by \"Display splash screen before payloads\" to fit a category of splash screens (as the screens will now be initied if and only if there are splash screens to display)\n- The `luma` folder will now be created automatically when saving the configuration for the first time (thus it has been removed from the release archive)\n- Other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience\n\n**Developer branch only**:\n- Implement arm11 exception handling (for NATIVE_FIRM only, unlike on arm9 where exceptions are handled everywhere, homebrews and Luma3DS itself included)\n- The arm9 exception handlers were improved (more information is dumped, bug fixes, etc.)\n- For both arm11 and arm9 exception handlers:\n  - Prevent double faults (when SP or PC were invalid)\n  - Handle svcBreak (this dumps the user-mode at the executed `svc 0x3c` instruction)\n  - Handle kernel panics (except on SAFE_FIRM)\n  - `/luma/dumps/arm9` and `/luma/dumps/arm11` are now be created automatically when they don't exist\n  - **Reminder**: this feature can only work on a9lh, and is guaranteed to work only if Luma3DS is launched as `arm9loaderhax.bin` \n- Exception handlers and related FIRM patches are now always enabled. The \"Developer options\" entry is now multi-choice, enabling you to choose between a standalone ErrDisp patch and the UNITINFO patch (both will make ErrDisp display some debugging information, but the UNITINFO patch will create problems with the eShop, amiibo, etc...)\n- Depending of the firmware being launched, `firmware.bin`, `firmware_twl.bin`, `firmware_agb.bin` or `firmware_safe.bin` will now always be read and used if they exist\n- Add support for reading the built-in kernel system modules (except for SAFE_FIRM) from `/luma/sysmodules/<module>.cxi` (this includes, of course, `loader.cxi`)\n- Add an option to disable various access checks: svc access checks and service access checks (patches courtesy of @Subv), FS archive access checks and arm9 exheader flags access checks\n- Removed the patch which disabled execution protection on two particular global kernel mappings (corresponding to FCRAM and VRAM, respectively) as it was totally unused\n- Other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the developer experience\n"}

and patched out the anti-downgrade checks for the latest (11.0) FIRM\n- Added support for recovery mode (L+R+Up+A) on A9LH (you can safely update SysNAND from it without losing A9LH)\n- Added support for N3DS 9.5 FIRM\n- Luma3DS doesn't reboot the console anymore when exiting its configuration menu (useful for non-A9LH users)\n- Splash screen timings are now consistent, it always lasts exactly 3 seconds\n- Fixed the FRIENDS module patch not to break online play (as it did after the 11.0 update) on future system updates. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n- 3ds_injector can now be larger than the original FIRM loader (will allow for more patches)\n- Fixed compiling with latest ctrulib\n- Several performance improvements, and other minor changes and bugfixes\n\n**Developer version only**:\n- Fixed the ARM9 exception handler\n- Registers are now displayed when an exception occurs\n- FCRAM and VRAM have been made executable from Kernel11\n- There are several bugs with the developer version for this release.

Now you can specify to autoboot SysNAND or not, and a NAND is no more tied to a FIRM (since 9.0 FIRM is autodetected). If you press nothing the default NAND is booted with its own FIRM, L boots the non-default NAND with its own FIRM, R boots EmuNAND with the SysNAND FIRM if you picked \"Use SysNAND FIRM as default\", and vice-versa.\n- Gotten rid of the patched FIRMs, AuReiNand now finds and loads all the FIRMs from CTRNAND by default. If you are booting an emuNAND, the FIRM will also be loaded from its CTRNAND by default. This applies to AGB and TWL FIRM too, and allows for a very fast boot with no firmware files on the SD card.\n- If for some reason (like using NTR) you do not want to use the CTRNAND FIRM, you can place a firmware.bin in the aurei folder and it will be loaded in place of the default FIRM (so, the SysNAND FIRM if you picked \"Use SysNAND FIRM as default\", and vice-versa).\n- In order for AuReiNand to handle FIRM reboots, the .bin path needs to be hardcoded in the program. The default is /arm9loaderhax.bin (the AuReiNand.dat is also supported for 9.0 people). A PC tool was written to make changing the path easier. Compiled versions are provided for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. On Windows just drag the ARN .bin on top of the program, and write the path. On the other OSes you need to use the tool from a command prompt. If you have AuReiNand as randomloader/default.bin, just type: randomloader/default.bin.\n- You can now use online for games even on outdated firmwares thanks to a patch by TuxSH. NVer is still needed to access the eShop and NNID-related services.\n- You can now have the console report itself as a developer unit, which enables additional debugging in ErrDisp and also allows you to run software for development 3DSes on retail consoles. Thanks to Steveice10 for this!\n- Rewrote the configuration menu to allow for multiple choice options and not to print the whole menu on each button press.\n- Added a region/language emulation feature, thanks to the hard work of TuxSH. Create a \"locales\" folder inside aurei, and one .txt for each game, with the title id of the game (look them up on 3dsdb.com). The txt must be exactly 6 characters long: 3 for the region (\"JPN\", \"USA\", \"EUR\", \"AUS\", \"CHN\", \"KOR\", \"TWN\"), a space, and two for the language (\"JP\", \"EN\", \"FR\", \"DE\", \"IT\", \"ES\", \"ZH\", \"KO\", \"NL\", \"PT\", \"RU\", \"TW\"). You can enable the feature globally in the config menu. This should also finally make DLCs for foreign games work.\n- Added a New 3DS CPU patch, again thanks to TuxSH. This only has an effect on New 3DS consoles, and allows you to configure the CPU inside the config menu, the same way NTR does: Off disables the patch, and then you can choose to enable the higher clock for all games, or the extra L2 cache, or both.\n- AuReiNand should automatically work with future New 3DS FIRMs as the key generation is now built-in.\n- Countless minor bug fixes and optimizations.\n- Heartfelt thanks to these people for this release: Gelex from #cakey who helped me debugging a very nasty bug in the early stages of development, and obviously TuxSH for all his work and Steveice10 for the UNITINFO patch. Also thanks to everyone who supports the project and helps fixing bugs.\n"}

Please note that if you're booting a 9.0/9.2 NAND with 9.0 FIRM the reboot patch can't be applied (to not screw up exploits), and so the patched AGB/TWL won't work. You can also optionally enable the original GBA boot screen in the config menu.\n- Fixed the second emuNAND patched FIRM still getting created.\n- Made L not needed to load most payloads. You can now launch these payloads: up.bin, down.bin, left.bin, right.bin, x.bin, y.bin with only the corresponding button, and select.bin and r.bin with L+SELECT and L+R respectively. default.bin is now launched with just START or if the the button's matching payload doesn't exist.\n- Added the possibility to configure the brightness for the built-in screen init. This is valid for all the instances in which AuRei inits the screen (config menu, payloads, errors). The 4 levels are respectively level 5, 4, 3, 2 from the 3DS OS. Just use Up to get to it in the config menu and use A to toggle.\n- Code cleaned up and made more readable.\n"}

This was inspired by Fix94's arm9select. Create a \"payloads\" directory inside the rei folder, put a \"default.bin\" inside (rename your existing arm9payload.bin if you have one), and (optionally) these other payloads: b.bin, x.bin, y.bin, select.bin, start.bin, right.bin, left.bin, up.bin, down.bin (press the matching button together with L and R to load the payload). Furthermore, the new loader will automatically perform the screen init before launching the payloads if this wasn't already done by A9LH itself.\n- Added dual emuNAND support. Please note that you can't have two 9.0 emuNANDs, and that if you want a 9.0 emuNAND it _must_ be the first one. To launch the second one, press R + B in updated sysNAND mode, or just B in regular mode. The code will just fallback to the first emuNAND if the second one is not found.\n"}
