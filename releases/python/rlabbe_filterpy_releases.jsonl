Documentation improvements.\n\nNote: Dumbness with git caused me to blow away all of my tags. I had a tag for each release, but did not realize pushing the project did not push the tags. A bit of hard drive stupidity, and _poof_. So, no good history for past releases.\n\nThese tag numbers correspond to the version number of the project on pypi. If you do `pip install filterpy` you will (as of now) get version 0.0.15 - this tag.\n"}
