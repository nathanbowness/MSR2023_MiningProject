Check the [wiki](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki/Attributes) for more details on which attributes are supported in which language.\r\n\r\nNew since v1.0 is the introduction of a [Certainty attribute](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki/Certainty-Attribute), which has an attribute property expressing the _level_ of certainty. A level of 9 means an expression of absolute certainty and a level of 1 means very low confidence. While you can specify (or override) an initial level of certainty with the attribute marker definition (e.g. in the [User Dictionary](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki/User-Dictionary)), rules processing may modify the value, e.g. in the context of a Negation Attribute.\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces three new [Generic attributes](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki/Generic-Attribute), which can be used by developers to tag use case specific attributes not covered by the built-in attribute types. Developers can add their own marker terms for these to leverage attribute expansion to flag syntactically \"affected\" portions of a sentence. A basic set of expansion rules are included for these generic attributes.\r\nFor example, we've helped customers in the healthcare industry add marker terms such as \"mother\", \"brother\", etc. so that mentions of \"family history\" can be identified in the text: \"_Patient mentioned *mother suffered a stroke 10y ago*, but denied experiencing chest pain himself_\"\r\n\r\n## CI/CD Pipeline\r\n\r\nThe Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline for this repository is implemented through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/actions), and now includes standard unit tests as well as [reference tests](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/blob/master/language_development/ref_testing.py) against a [gold standard](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/tree/master/reference_materials) to ensure the highest quality output.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\nWe made a change to the Sentence attribute structure emitted by the `iknowpy` module. In v1.0, the fixed number of properties (value, unit, value2, unit2) has been converted to a list of pairs, enabling a more flexible way of passing sentence attribute properties:\r\n\r\n        struct Sent_Attribute:\r\n               Attribute type \"type_\"\r\n               size_t offset_start \"offset_start_\", offset_stop \"offset_stop_\"\r\n               string marker \"marker_\"\r\n               string value \"value_\", unit \"unit_\", value2 \"value2_\", unit2 \"unit2_\"\r\n               Entity_Ref entity_ref\r\n               Path entity_vector\r\n\r\nwas changed to : \r\n\r\n       ctypedef vector[pair[string, string]] Sent_Attribute_Parameters\r\n       struct Sent_Attribute:\r\n               Attribute type \"type_\"\r\n               size_t offset_start \"offset_start_\", offset_stop \"offset_stop_\"\r\n               string marker \"marker_\"\r\n               Sent_Attribute_Parameters parameters \"parameters_\"\r\n               Entity_Ref entity_ref\r\n               Path entity_vector\r\n\r\nExisting code should change as follows : \r\n\r\n    sent_attribute['value'] = sent_attribute['parameters'][0][0]\r\n    sent_attribute['unit'] = sent_attribute['parameters'][0][1]\r\n    sent_attribute['value2'] = sent_attribute['parameters'][1][0]\r\n    sent_attribute['unit2'] = sent_attribute['parameters'][1][1]\r\n"}
