Should you still need (minor) additions/fixes to the `v1.x.x` release, there's a `master-1.x.x` branch for that. Though, please avoid adding any big functionality there.\r\n\r\n**Note: This version can not be imported due to a bug. Please use `v2.0.1` or later**\r\n\r\nFreeType is not available to all build environments. See `README.md`, chapter \"Extras\" for details.\r\n\r\n## v1.x.x incompatible API changes:\r\n* `imgui.HoveredFlagsDefault` has been renamed to `imgui.HoveredFlagsNone` to be in line with other flag enumerations\r\n* `FontAtlas.GlyphRangesChinese()` has been removed (was a deprecated function). Use `FontAtlas.GlyphRangesChineseFull()` instead.\r\n* `imgui.SetNextTreeNodeOpen()` has been removed. It has been replaced by `imgui.SetNextItemOpen()`.\r\n* Change of `Columns` API\r\n  * Removal of `ColumnsFlags*` (without replacement)\r\n  * Signature of `imgui.ColumnsV()` has changed. The `flags` parameter has been changed to a boolean.\r\n  * Note: The Columns API is still marked as \"work-in-progress\" im **Dear ImGui** and is to become superseded by an upcoming `Tables` API.\r\n\r\n> It may have been possible to keep compatibility with forwarding functions and double definitions, and the WIP columns API is not recommended anyway. Yet, even **Dear ImGui** starts cleaning up to remove deprecated functions, and I want to avoid keeping such baggage as well."}
