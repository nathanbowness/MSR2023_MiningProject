In fact, I recommend renaming your config as well, allowing the new \r\nversion to generate a new one with the correct options (otherwise, you will receive console spam when starting your server). \r\n\r\nA release candidate is basically like a snapshot for Minecraft, meaning things are likely to change and bugs are \r\nexpected! If you run into any unexpected behavior, feel free to \r\n[create an issue](https://github.com/cjburkey01/ClaimChunk/issues) to let me know.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this version **does not convert your old config values to the new world profile system** (more on that \r\nsystem in this changelog).\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Update java version updated from 8 to 16 to match 1.16/1.17!\r\n* Fix version checker message (finally!).\r\n* Fixed host of annoying console errors.\r\n* World Profiles\r\n  * Most protection settings are per-world now!\r\n  * **Each world has a file located in `SERVER/plugins/ClaimChunk/worlds/` describing who has access in which particular chunks.**\r\n    * This file contains instructions as well as default settings that disable interactions on entities and blocks within claimed chunks (not owned by the interacting player).\r\n    * ClaimChunk can be disabled for each world in its file.\r\n* Commands\r\n  * Many of the multi-word subcommands for `/claimchunk` and `/chunk` have been separated into different words!\r\n    * Thanks to [a new command system by Goldmensch](https://github.com/Goldmensch/SmartCommandDispatcher).\r\n  * The changed commands are:\r\n    * Admin:\r\n      * `/chunk admin override`\r\n      * `/chunk admin reload`\r\n      * `/chunk admin unclaim`\r\n      * `/chunk admin unclaim all <PLAYER> [ALL WORLDS? true/false]`\r\n    * Player:\r\n      * `/chunk unclaim all [ALL WORLDS? true/false]`\r\n  * Added new commands:\r\n    * `/chunk show claimed`\r\n      * Shows nearby claimed chunks\r\n      * Permission: `claimchunk.show-claimed` (default with `claimchunk.player`)\r\n    * `/chunk scan [RADIUS IN CHUNKS]`\r\n      * Counts number of nearby claims owned by other players.\r\n      * Permission: `claimchunk.scan` (default with claimchunk.scan).\r\n* Permissions\r\n  * `claimchunk.base` has been removed (finally, ugh, what was the point?).\r\n* Config\r\n  * Removed much of the `protection` category and inserted into the world profiles.\r\n\r\nChanges to happen:\r\n* Switch to [a new message system handler also by Goldmensch](https://github.com/Goldmensch/JALL).\r\n* Per-world disallowed commands.\r\n"}
