# TNTRun_reloaded

This was originally forked from the (now unsupported) TNTRun by Shevchik for Minecraft v1.9 and has been improved and updated as new versions of Minecraft have been released. The latest version runs on all Minecraft versions from 1.13 to 1.5.2, while the legacy version is for servers running Minecraft versions from 1.8 through to 1.12.2.


## Description

TNTRun is a fully automated minigame plugin that is based on the popular map TNTRUN. Players start on a layer of sand and every block that they step on disappears. If a player falls through a hole, he will continue to run on the layer below. When a player falls through the final layer he loses the game. The last player remaining wins the game.

## Download

If your server is running Minecraft 1.13 or later, then the latest version of TNTRun\_reloaded can be [downloaded from Spigot.](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tntrun_reloaded.53359/ "TNTRun_reloaded")

For Minecraft versions from 1.8 through to 1.12.2, the legacy version of TNTRun\_reloaded (version 6.8) can also be downloaded from Spigot by visiting the "Version History" tab on the plugin pages.

Note that there is a legacy bug fix release (version 6.8.2) only available from the GitHub Releases tab above, which fixes a couple of bugs with Featherboard/scoreboards and with "stats". It can be [downloaded here.](https://github.com/steve4744/TNTRun/releases/download/v6.8.1/TNTRun_reloaded_6.8.2.jar "v6.8.2")
