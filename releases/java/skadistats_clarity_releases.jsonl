If you don't want that, put an explicit dependency on the version you want into your pom.xml\n\n**Also note:** I also moved the protobuf-classes to another package, so when you update to 1.2\nyou might have to adjust a lot of imports. A global search and replace from `com.dota2.proto.` to \n`skadistats.clarity.wire.proto.` on your whole project should do the trick.\n"}
