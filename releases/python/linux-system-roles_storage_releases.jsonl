Furthermore, the error was being masked by\nthe `rescue` block because the rescue was not checking for the\ncorrect error message.  The fix is to use `volume1_size` AND check\nfor the correct error message.\n\nI'll note that there are several tests that do not look for the\ncorrect error message, and we may run into this problem with other\ntests.\n\n# skip test if kvdo and dm-vdo are not found\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991062\n\nAm getting this error when testing vdo:\n```\nFailed to commit changes to disk: Process reported exit code 3: modprobe: FATAL: Module dm-vdo not found in directory /lib/modules/5.14.0-0.rc4.35.el9.x86_64\n  /usr/sbin/modprobe failed: 1\n  vdo: Required device-mapper target(s) not detected in your kernel.\n  Run `lvcreate --help' for more information.\n```\nSo I'll just skip vdo testing unless both kvdo and dm-vdo are found."}
