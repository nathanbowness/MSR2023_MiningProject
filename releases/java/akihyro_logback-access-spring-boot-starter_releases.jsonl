You can read more about it here: [Custom expansion keys](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Custom-expansion-keys).\r\n\r\n### Haptic feedback\r\nThis release introduces `PageCollapseEligibilityHapticFeedback` that can play haptic feedback during a pull-to-collapse gesture to indicate when the page can be released to collapse.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\nFor apps that use a custom `DimPainter`, this release unfortunately introduces a breaking change to the function signature of `DimPainter#cancelAnimation()`.\r\n"}
