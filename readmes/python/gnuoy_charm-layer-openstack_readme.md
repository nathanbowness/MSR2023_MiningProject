# Overview

This layer provides the base OpenStack configuration options and dependencies
for authoring OpenStack Charms.  Typically you won't use this layer directly
the [openstack-api](https://github.com/openstack/charm-layer-openstack-api)
or [openstack-principle](https://github.com/openstack/charm-layer-openstack-principle)
layers which consume this layer are probably more interesting as layers to
directly use.
