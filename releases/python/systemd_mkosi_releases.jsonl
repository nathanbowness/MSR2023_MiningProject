See https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/pull/1037 for more information.\r\n- Support for Photon was dropped. See https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/pull/1048 for more information.\r\n- The Arch kernel/bootloader pacman hooks were removed. For anyone that still wants to use them, they can be found [here](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/tree/v13/mkosi/resources/arch).\r\n- mkosi now creates `distro~release` subdirectories inside the build, cache and output directories for each `distro~release` combination that is built. This allows building for multiple distros without throwing away the results of a previous distro build every time. \r\n- The preferred names for mkosi configuration files and directories are now mkosi.conf and mkosi.conf.d/ respectively. The old names (mkosi.default and mkosi.default.d) have been removed from the docs but are still supported for backwards compatibility.\r\n- `plain_squashfs` type images will now also be named with a `.raw` suffix.\r\n- `tar` type images will now respect the `--compress` option.\r\n- Pacman's `SigLevel` option was changed to use the same default value as used on Arch which is `SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional`. If this results in keyring errors, you need to update the keyring by running `pacman-key --populate archlinux`.\r\n- Support for CentOS 7 was dropped. If you still need to support CentOS 7, we recommend using any mkosi version up to 13.\r\n- Support for BIOS/grub was dropped. because EFI hardware is widely available and legacy BIOS systems do not support the feature set to fully verify a boot chain from firmware to userland and it has become bothersome to maintain for little use.\r\n\r\n  To generate BIOS images you can use any version of mkosi up to mkosi 13 or the new `--bios-size` option. This can be used to add a BIOS boot partition of the specified size on which `grub` (or any other bootloader) can be installed with the help of mkosi's script support (depending on your needs most likely `mkosi.postinst` or `mkosi.finalize`). This method can also be used for other EFI bootloaders that mkosi intentionally does not support.\r\n- mkosi now unconditionally copies the kernel, initrd and kernel cmdline from the image that were previously only copied out for Qemu boot.\r\n- mkosi now runs apt and dpkg on the host. As such, we now require apt and dpkg to be installed on the host along with debootstrap in order to be able to build debian/ubuntu images.\r\n- Split dm-verity artifacts default names have been changed to match what `systemd` and other tools expect: `image.root.raw`, `image.root.verity`, `image.root.roothash`, `image.root.roothash.p7s` (same for `usr` variants).\r\n- `mkosi` will again default to the same OS release as the host system when the host system uses the same distribution as the image that's being built.\r\n- By default, `mkosi` will now change the owner of newly created directories to `SUDO_UID` or `PKEXEC_UID` if defined, unless `--no-chown` is used.\r\n- If `systemd-nspawn` v252 or newer is used, bind-mounted directories with `systemd-nspawn` will use the new `rootidmap` option so files and directories created from within the container will be owned by the actual directory owner on the host.\r\n"}

The old name made   sense with virtual ethernet devices, but when booting images with qemu a   TUN/TAP device is used instead.\r\n- The network config file installed by mkosi when the `--netdev` (previously   `--network-veth`) option is used (formerly\r\n  `/etc/systemd/network/80-mkosi-network-veth.network` in the image) now only   matches network interfaces using the `virtio_net` driver. Please make sure   you weren't relying on this file to configure any network interfaces other   than the tun/tap virtio-net interface created by mkosi when booting the image   in QEMU with the `--netdev` option. If you were relying on this config file \r\n  to configure other interfaces, you'll have to re-create it with the correct   match and a lower initial number in the filename to make sure   `systemd-networkd` will keep configuring your interface, e.g. via the   `mkosi.skeleton` or `mkosi.extra` trees or a `mkosi.postinst` script. \r\n- The `kernel-install` script for building unified kernel images has been   removed. From v13 onwards, on systems using `kernel-install`, `mkosi` won't   automatically build new unified kernel images when a kernel is updated or   installed. To keep the old behavior, you can install the `kernel-install`   script manually via a skeleton tree; a copy can be found   [here](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/blob/3798eb0c2ebcdf7dac207a559a3cb5a65cdb77b0/mkosi/resources/dracut_unified_kernel_install.sh).\r\n- New `QemuKvm` option configures whether to use KVM when running `mkosi qemu`.\r\n- `mkosi` will not default to the same OS release as the host system anymore   when the host system uses the same distribution as the image that's being   built. Instead, when no release is specified, mkosi will now always default   to the default version embedded in mkosi itself.\r\n- `mkosi` will now use the `pacman` keyring from the host when building Arch   images. This means that users will, on top of installing `archlinux-keyring`,   also have to run `pacman-key --init` and `pacman-key --populate archlinux` on\r\n  the host system to be able to build Arch images. Also, unless the package   manager is configured to do it automatically, the host keyring will have to   be updated after `archlinux-keyring` updates by running `pacman-key   --populate archlinux` and `pacman-key --updatedb`.\r\n- Direct qemu linux boot is now supported with `BootProtocols=linux`. When   enabled, the kernel image, initrd, and cmdline will be extracted from the   image and passed to `qemu` by `mkosi qemu` to directly boot into the kernel   image without a bootloader. This can be used to boot for example s390x images   in `qemu`.\r\n- The initrd will now always be rebuilt after the extra trees and build   artifacts have been installed into the image.\r\n- The github action has been migrated to Ubuntu Jammy. To migrate any jobs   using the action, add `runs-on: ubuntu-22.04` to the job config.\r\n- All images are now configured by default with the `C.UTF-8` locale.\r\n- New `--repository-directory` option can be used to configure a directory with   extra repository files to be used by the package manager when building an   image. Note that this option is currently only supported for `pacman` and\r\n  `dnf`-based distros. \r\n- Option `--skeleton-tree` is now supported on Debian-based distros.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/systemd/mkosi/releases/69957886/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
