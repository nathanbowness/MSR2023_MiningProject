Changes:\n- PkgInfo now depends on [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), an HTML and XML parsing library for Python. Instructions on how to install it are present in the [README](README.md).\n- PkgInfo: added a pkgsearch command for searching packages in Debian and Ubuntu's repositories.\n- TLDInfo was broken in the last alpha release, this has now been fixed (my bad!)\n- Unit tests were added for some plugins (ref #13).\n  - These can be ran by cloning the repository, changing to its directory, and running `supybot-test <plugin>/`\n- Python 3 support is now working (this wasn't properly mentioned in 1.1-alpha1's ~~really messy~~ release notes).\n"}
