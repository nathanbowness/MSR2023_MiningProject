# A multi-sketch [Processing 3](https://processing.org) template for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Looking to get up and running with Processing on the IntelliJ IDE? You're probably better of starting with [mkj-is/processing-intellij](https://github.com/mkj-is/processing-intellij).

Tired of cloning and moving between projects? Try this template on for size.

## Setting up: 

1. Clone this repo 
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (File > Open.. > Navigate to processing-intellij)
1. Open Debug Config (see screenshot below)
1. Add the same configuration you see on the screenshot (see screenshot)
1. Build & run (```shift+f10``` on windoes)

2. Create a new class from the```SketchBase``` template

3. In ```BaseMain```, add the path to your new sketch's base class to the ```sketches`` String array (the format is _pacakgeName.ClassName_)

4. To add classes to a sketch, create a class from ```SketchObject``` in the same package as the sketch base class. Make sure to always pass the PApplet object (```this```) into the constructor, so that PApplet's methods (```fill()```, `colorModer()`, `random()` and so on) will be available inside the object, from the local PApplet object (In the `example.Example` sketch, I've used `p` as the PApplet inside the Walker object)
