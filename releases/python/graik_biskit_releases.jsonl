The dependency to Scientific Python has been removed, which should ease installation. SciPy, by contrast, is now a hard dependency. This is the first release after migration to github.\n\n**_1. Make Biskit compatible with latest numpy version (1.9+)**_\nSee: https://github.com/graik/biskit/pull/2\n- All dependencies to numpy.oldnumeric were removed (a stripped down version of numpy.oldnumeric is now integrated with Biskit -- This is only a stop-gap measure. Use the normal numpy in your own extensions and scripts.\n\n**_2. Remove dependency on Scientific Python**_\nSee: https://github.com/graik/biskit/pull/2\n\nPythonScientific (not to be mistaken with the more recent scipy) also suffers from dependency on numpy.oldnumeric. We only used Scientific.IO for PDB parsing. A (heavily) stripped down version of Scientific.IO is now integrated with Biskit. All references to the larger Scientific package were removed.\n\n**_3. Updates wrappers for third-party software**_\n- AmberTools 15:\n  - AmberCrdEntropist and others now use cpptraj instead of ptraj\n  - default paths were adapted to Amber 14\n\nSeveral other wrappers were upgraded and tested to work with recent versions:\n- Delphi v. 6\n- SurfaceRacer upgraded to v. 5.0\n  - modified default mask to exclude both hydrogen and solvent atoms\n\nThe following wrappers were verified to work:\n- Pymoler (pymol)\n- TMAlign\n- SurfaceRacer\n- Amber-related (cpptraj, ambpdb, reduce) -- AmberEntropist, AmberParmBuilder, etc.\n- Prosa2003\n- Delphi\n\nWrappers for the following programs are known _not_ to work for recent versions:\n- HMMer\n- FoldX\n- Intervor\n- DSSP -- issue pending\n\nThe Biskit.Mod package (homology modelling) would need a major update to deal with recent ncbitools and related software. I won't find the time for this. Volunteers most welcome!\n\nPVM and parallelization were not tested for this release. Please report if you encounter issues.\n\n**_4. Deprecated modules**_\n- Biskit.ChainCleaner and related modules for the pdb2xplor.py script -- ancient code, heavily using Scientific Python which cannot any longer be easily installed -- superseeded by PDBCleaner and derived modules in Biskit.Mod\n- Biskit.ProsaII -- superseeded by Prosa2003\n\nFoldX, Intervor, WhatIf, ICMCad will probably be deprecated as well but are still part of the package for reference.\n\n**_5. Other changes**_\n- improvements to test reporting (less clutter, timing for tests taking more than 0.5s)\n- ProfileCollection.concat does not any longer drop profiles that are missing from a concatenation partner. The existing profile is instead expanded and filled with the registered default value.\n- several bug fixes\n- better cleanup of temporary files and folders (for tests and Executor)\n\n## Test Status\n\nAs mentioned above, I couldn't test all third-party software wrappers and haven't looked at parallelisation (PVM) modules, which should probably be re-visited and ported to a more recent infrastructure. That being said, all tests that do _not_ depend on external programs or pvm should pass:\n\n`python Biskit/test.py -e exe pvm old`\nreturns:\n\n```\nSUMMARY:\n=======\n\nA total of 111 tests from 117 modules were run.\n   - 111 passed\n   - 0 failed\n```\n\nCode coverage by unit tests was at 61% in my recent test runs. However, these were not including PVM-related test cases and several third-party programs were not installed. The actual coverage should be closer to 75 or 80%. \n"}
