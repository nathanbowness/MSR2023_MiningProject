# nairn-mpm-fea

This project contains source code for the computational mechanics software originating
from <a href='http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/wse/faculty/Nairn'>John A. Nairn's research group</a> at
<a href='http://oregonstate.edu/'>Oregon State University</a>. To get started, visit the <a href="https://github.com/nairnj/nairn-mpm-fea/wiki">Home</a> page of
this web site's wiki pages.

This project began on August 14, 2015 when it was exported from
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/nairn-mpm-fea">Google Code</a> just prior to that service being
terminated as a development platform.
