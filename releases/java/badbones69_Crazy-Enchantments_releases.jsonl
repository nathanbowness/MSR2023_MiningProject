I have not posted a full update in a long time. \r\n\r\n## Added:\r\n- Updated /ce debug to include null enchantment types.\r\n- Failed dust has been added to tab completion.\r\n- Support for SaberFactions.\r\n- Support for SuperiorSkyblock. Thanks to @OmerBenGera \r\n- The names of each mob for ally enchantments can be edited in the config.yml.\r\n- Hex color support.\r\n- 1.16 support.\r\n\r\n## New Enchantment:\r\n- BeeKeeper will spawn Bees around the player to help fight for the user. Thanks to gm1224 for this Pull Request.\r\n\r\n## Fixed:\r\n- Fix protection crystal dupe glitch.\r\n- NPE from gkitz.\r\n- The Blast enchantment doesn't drop items when using a furnace or auto smelt with it.\r\n- Fixed NPE when a CEPlayer isn't found for rage.\r\n- If an enchantment does not have the option Enchantment-Type: in the Enchantments.yml it causes that enchantment's type to be null and stop working.\r\n- Using old gkit files from CE 1.7.9.3.2 down caused no enchantments to show on the items.\r\n- Fixed Gkit preview.\r\n- Fixed issue with tab complete not working.\r\n- Fixed NME for 1.8.8 servers.\r\n- Fixed Experience enchantment working on silk touch items.\r\n- Fixed HellForge not working on equipped items and 1.13+.\r\n- 1.13.2- had an issue where (Telepathy + Silk Touch) and (Telepathy + Silk Touch + Blast) caused items like lapis ore to give the ink instead of the ore.\r\n- Fixed Blast would give EXP even with silktouch.\r\n- Fixed GKitz preview not scaling with item total.\r\n- Fixed NPE from tinker GUI.\r\n- Fixed BlackSmith not allowing enchanted items.\r\n- Fixed shulker boxes not dropping when using telepathy on it.\r\n- Disarmer was not working.\r\n- Failed dust was coded to be allowed in the /cc dust command but due to a bug, it wasn't available.\r\n- Using the enchantment Telepathy and breaking a block that has a torch or flower on top of it causes it to now drop.\r\n- Fixed Telepathy giving 1 to many items.\r\n- Player heads on 1.13+ could not activate helmet enchantments.\r\n- Fixed rare NPE from Telepathy and Blast.\r\n- NPE when hooking into GriefProtection.\r\n- Fixed issue with items making missing textures with some enchantments.\r\n- Telepathy enchantment caused duplications sometimes for some blocks due to async.\r\n- Sugar Cane would not break correctly. Now it breaks from top-down to the broken block. This allows for easier farming as it doesn't remove the whole plant if breaking the middle.\r\n- Fixed error from StackMobs Legacy.\r\n- When CE converts the old v1.7 gkit file to work with the new system it removes the old \"customenchantments:\" and \"enchantments:\" placeholders.

Just by adding another \":\" after the 1st option it allows you to add another option to it.\r\nExample:\r\n  - 'Item:Potion:Red:Speed'\r\n- Update to the latest FactionsUUID API.\r\n- Added Neutral as an enemy.\r\n- `/ce limit` will show the user information about their enchantment limit. It shows if they have a limit bypass if it counts vanilla enchantments in their limit, their current enchantment limit, and how many enchantments are on their item in their hand.\r\n\r\n## Fixed:\r\n- NPE when loading due to missing options.\r\n- NPE when checking if an enchantment is activated.\r\n- NPE when checking if an item can be enchanted.\r\n- NPE when trying to tab-complete broken enchantments.\r\n- NPE from bow enchantments.\r\n- NPE from mob spawn enchantments.\r\n- OutOfBounds when getting enchantments on an item.\r\n- OutOfBounds error when setting a customizer option to a slot bigger than the inventory size.\r\n- OutOfBounds error in ShopManager.\r\n- NoClassDefFoundError error from bows on 1.12.2-.\r\n- Fixed lostbook name placeholder being case sensitive.\r\n- 1.9+ servers get errors due to missing sound name.\r\n- Enchantments that are disabled could still be obtained from the shop.\r\n- Fixed issue with lightning enchantments hurting protected entities.\r\n- When telepathy broke skull items it made them lose the skin they had before. Telepathy now does not pick up heads to protect their skins.\r\n- Lightning enchantments could cause an infinite loop due to how checks are calling the same event that is being checked and so it is being checked in an infinite loop without ignoring the event instead.\r\n- Due to a spigot update in 1.14.4+, it broke blast and telepathy from giving blocks.\r\n- When checking for the number of enchantments including vanilla enchantments it would set the amount found to be ONLY the amount of vanilla enchantments are on the item. It would not include the custom ones because the vanilla number would overwrite the custom amount instead of adding to it.\r\n- Fixed Abstract Arrow class being called on 1.13 when it is 1.14+.\r\n- Planter enchantment would cause infinite food.\r\n- Some blocks did not drop items when using telepathy.\r\n- Fixed unbreakable items losing textures due to some enchantments.\r\n\r\n## Code Changes:\r\n- Recoded the ItemBuilder.convertString() method.\r\n- Added getFromName methods to Dust and Scrolls classes.\r\n- Recoded command classes.\r\n- Wings class has been recoded to be more efficient.\r\n- Replaced old SkipBreakEvents methods to new IgnoreEvents methods.

If set to blank it will not send any message.\r\n- Every command now has a TabComplete option when hitting tab. It will auto-suggest inputs for the user.\r\n\r\n## New Enchantments:\r\n- StickyShot has a 10%(+10% per level) chance to spawn a web where it hits. It also spawns a 3x3 area under an entity if hit.\r\n- Disorder has a 1%(+1% per level) chance to disorder the enemies hot-bar.\r\n- Charge gives you and nearby allies a speed boost when you kill a player.\r\n- Revenge gives you speed regeneration and haste when an ally is killed nearby.\r\n- BattleCry has a 10%(+5% per level) to send nearby enemies flying backward.\r\n- Famished has a 10%(+5% per level) to give the enemy hunger.\r\n- Greenthumb has a 10%(+10% per level) chance to fully grow crops but at the cost of the hoe's durability.\r\n- Harvest will break all fully grown crops in a 3x3 area.\r\n- Tiller automatically tills a 3x3 area when tilling the ground and will hydrate the soil if within 4 blocks of a water source.\r\n- Planter will automatically plant the seed in your off-hand or the next one in your hot-bar.\r\n\r\n## Enchantment Integration:\r\n- GreenThumb and Planter can be used together to fully grow a seed when planted. (Depends if greenthumb chance is successful for all spots.)\r\n- GreenThumb, Planter, and Tiller can be used together to plant a fully grown 3x3 area of crops. (Depends if greenthumb chance is successful for all spots.)\r\n- Harvester and Telepathy can be used together to pick up all crops in a 3x3 area and put it straight into your inventory.\r\n\r\n## Fixed:\r\n- WG and WE were required to use CE otherwise it would error and disable.\r\n- Book names that start with &f would cause errors. It is due to how MC handles the &f color code at the beginning of items. Instead of leaving it in the name of the item it instead removes it from the name if its the 1st thing at the beginning of the name.\r\n- Bunch of random spelling mistakes.\r\n- When the allowed block list was limited, a blast pick no longer broke the target block unless it was in the block list.\r\n- Error when a sound is played that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n## Removed:\r\n- Removed SimpleClans support due to it being outdated.\r\n- Info GUI settings have been moved from the Messages.yml file to the new Enchantment-Types.yml file.\r\n\r\n## Updated:\r\n- [StackMob](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/29999/) has been updated.\r\n- Category class has been fully recoded and uses new Objects instead of strings.\r\n- LostBook class has been fully recoded and uses new Objects instead of strings.\r\n- Some methods have been recoded and renamed.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Hitosherizu and @pmme for the pull requests they made for this update. <3"}

"### Added:\r\n- 1.8.8-1.12.2 support has been re-added due to many many MANY requests.\r\n- Lightning-Sound-Range: <distance in blocks> option in the config to control how far lightning sounds can be heard from.\r\n- WorldGuard v6 and v7 support has been added.\r\n- All files with version specific item names have been separated to 1.12.2-Down and 1.13-Up files so that the files that regenerate their files will get the correct file for their Minecraft version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed:\r\n- The wings enchantment particle would not show when enabled.\r\n- Players in creative mode would drop XP when using the blast enchantment on some blocks.\r\n- The Blast enchantment would not obey protection regions due to checking in sync while the code is still firing async.\r\n- When mass breaking blocks with Blast and Efficiency it would cause errors to spam console.\r\n- Error when trying to fire an event while async and causing issues on 1.14+ servers.\r\n- When opening mystery dust it would give a huge amount of other dust when opened.\r\n- When using the /ce dust <type> [amount] [player] [percent] command to give specific dust it only gives one dust instead of the specific amount.\r\n- 1.13+ would not break Grass blocks by default with blast due to the item name change to Grass_Block instead of Grass.\r\n- BlackSmith's result CEBook would not glow even if the toggled on.\r\n- In 1.9+ right-clicking a CEBook would say the description 2x.\r\n- Could not break a block while having a CEBook in your hand.\r\n- Decapitation and Headless would never give player heads.\r\n- Pull, Piercing, IceFreeze, and Doctor enchantments would not work.\r\n\r\n### Removed:\r\n- The default Gkitz.yml gave items with aqua infinity on them even though they are not helmets.\r\n\r\n### Updated:\r\n- Metrics class due to 1.14 library changes."}
