This functionality uses the new Pebble \u201cexec\u201d API, which behaves similarly to lxd exec or kubectl exec \u2013 the Pebble CLI has a corresponding pebble exec command. The tool allows an operator to run a one-off command inside the workload container. It is very useful for troubleshooting, as well as performing maintenance tasks that haven\u2019t yet been formalized as an action in a charm.\r\n\r\nThis release also includes a change to juju debug-code. The command now stops on all events and hooks, allowing charm authors to enter a debugging session without needing to specify a specific hook in advance. Charm authors can still access the old behavior by explicitly calling juju debug-code --at .\r\n\r\nOF 1.3.0 adds a mocked out filesystem to the testing harness. Charm authors can now attach and detach virtual storage, and read and write files to the test filesystem. This feature has been long requested, and allows for much more complete unit test coverage for charms.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the charmed operator framework now exposes a \u201cplanned unit count,\u201d to allow charms to handle HA config and similar features that require a peer count in advance of the peers actually coming online. The information supplied by this feature, comprising a single int that represents the number of peers (inclusive of the current unit) an application is expected to have, is intentionally minimalist. Charm authors should use this feature to save unnecessary execution of HA setup in an environment that doesn\u2019t need it (or unnecessary non HA setup in an environment that does). Code paths using the feature should understand that the int can change, and that it does not include a guarantee that the units will be available. (If there is a deploy issue with a unit, for example, the planned unit count will not be reached until a human operator intervenes and resolves the issue.)\r\n\r\nBeyond these highlights, 1.3.0 includes many minor features and bugfixes. A complete list follows:\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nInclude task logs in ChangeError.str (#653)\r\nAdd support for storage to the testing harness.\r\nAdd send_signal to pebble.Client and model.Container (#669)\r\nAdd a test for restarting Pebble services on older Pebble versions (#658)\r\nAdd storage details to storage events #\r\nAdded support for One-shot commands #593\r\nAdded \u201cplanned unit count\u201d to model. #597\r\nAdd support for the new wait-change API #595\r\nLet \u2018debug-code\u2019 catch all events by default #565\r\nFlatten nested dictionaries passed to action_set() #630\r\nAdd pebble replan, support serverside restart. #580\r\nAdded storage mappings to ContainerMeta as ContainerStorageMeta #601\r\nRemove ops.relation module #606 (Requires/Provides functionality now lives in a library.)\r\nExpose model uuid in ops.model.Model #563\r\nExpose \u2018limit\u2019 in RelationMeta and improve \u2018scope\u2019 #552\r\nAdd user/group fields to Service (layer configuration) #540\r\nAdd __eq__ to ops.pebble.Service so layer service equality can be checked (#592)\r\nSend a list of services to stop to pebble in restart() instead (#591)\r\nMake Container.restart() semantics operate more like system services (#588)\r\nVarious documentation and testing harness improvements.\r\nStreamlined build, test and release process.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\nAdjust the ops.model.Resources.fetch method to throw a NameError (#661)\r\nFix storage events with multiple hyphens #663\r\nExec test fixes and \u201cfor line in process.stdout\u201d fix (#655)\r\nFixed issue with float to decimal conversion causing trouble with metrics. #609\r\nFixed exception with very large log messages by splitting them #632\r\nFix Pebble push() handling of binary files #574\r\nFix Container.restart() accidentally operating on strings, add a testcase #590\r\nVarious testing harness bugfixes.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/canonical/operator/compare/1.2.0...1.3.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/operator/releases/55470954/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

that should aid debugging.\r\n\r\n* event deferral and re\u00ebmission is now logged (at DEBUG).\r\n\r\n* if `use_juju_for_storage` is specified for a charm running in a Juju that does\r\n  not support this feature, a clear and explicit error is raised.\r\n\r\n* the public attributes of `model` are now immutable. This is to discourage\r\n  people from overwriting these attributes in tests, given there is a fair\r\n  amount of internal state. Please use the harness instead (or mocking if you\r\n  must).\r\n\r\n* the test suite now passes on Windows, and we run the full suite on Windows for\r\n  every commit, as we do for linux and macos.\r\n"}

(`install`, `leader-elected`, etc.). While most unit tests\r\n    should be more focused on a single hook interaction, this gives a bit more\r\n    confidence that the whole initialization step of the charm operates in a\r\n    good manner.\r\n\r\n  - `Harness.get_pod_spec()` allows a test to introspect what pod spec was set\r\n    in response to their update event. Eg.,\r\n\r\n        harness = Harness(MyCharm)\r\n        # ... initial setup\r\n        harness.begin()\r\n        harness.update_config({'foo': 'bar'})\r\n        pod_spec, k8s_resources = harness.get_pod_spec()\r\n        self.assertIsNone(k8s_resources)\r\n        self.assertEqual(pod_spec['blah']['blah'], 'bar')\r\n\r\n  - `Harness.cleanup()` is now available to ensure that any temporary\r\n    files/directories created by the harness are cleaned up. For unittest you\r\n    would use this as:\r\n\r\n        harness = Harness(MyCharm)\r\n        self.addCleanup(harness.cleanup)\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    This is currently only relevant if you are running tests that make use of\r\n    resources (either `add_oci_resource` or `add_resource`). However, it is good\r\n    practice to start making use of it, in case there are other resources\r\n    associated with `Harness` that will need to be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n  - `Harness.add_resource()` is now also available so that you can feed your\r\n    charm code file content that it would get from `resource-get`.\r\n\r\n* You no longer need to call `ops.lib.autoimport` before your first call to\r\n  `ops.lib.use`; you only need to do it if the library information is out of\r\n  date (e.g. if you installed or otherwise altered what the system would find).\r\n  Also a lot more logging of the process of autodiscovery has been added.\r\n  Thanks to @stub42 for pointing out how needing the first call was\r\n  counter-intuitive, and the process hard to debug.\r\n\r\n* Libraries used via `ops.lib.use` can now have subpackages or modules.\r\n\r\n* `dispatch`-aware charms that set `JUJU_DISPATCH_PATH` before calling into the\r\n  framework caused the framework to think the Juju it was running on supported\r\n  dispatch, even if the version was clearly too old for that. This meant that\r\n  non-initial hooks were never called on these charms on those\r\n  Jujus. Unfortunately charms created with `charmcraft` 0.3 fell into this\r\n  category. The framework now looks directly at the Juju version to determine\r\n  dispatch support. Thanks to @gnuoy for finding reporting this.\r\n"}

From now on, breaking changes will be announced, and we\u2019ll have a deprecation procedure to ease things in (or rather, out). These breaking changes are:\r\n\r\n* The `Framework` object\u2019s [`observe`] method\u2019s second argument can no longer be an instance, and must be a method on an instance. That is, where previously you could write\r\n\r\n  ```python\r\n  self.framework.observe(self.on.install, self)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  as a shortcut, but we found that this pushes people down a path that actually makes their charms less maintainable. Especially when it comes to writing components, it is better to have clearly named functions and clearly defined targets.\r\n\r\n  So from now on the only supported way is to explicitly specify the callback method,\r\n\r\n  ```python\r\n  self.framework.observe(self.on.install, self._on_install)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  (note we also recommend event handlers to be clearly marked as non-public).\r\n\r\n* Relations' [`role`] attribute is now an `enum`, and in particular *peer* relation's role is now `\"peer\"` (it used to be `\"peers\"` which was just wrong).\r\n\r\nThis release includes full support for Juju 2.8's `dispatch` mechanism,including both use cases of dispatch being a symlink to the charm code, and dispatch being a small shim that executes the charm. The latter is an incremental improvement over what we mentioned in the [last dev summary], and is already being used by `charmcraft`.\r\n\r\nLastly, `Model` objects now have a [`name`] property (populated from `JUJU_MODEL_NAME`). This was a feature requested by charmers.\r\n\r\n[last dev summary]: https://discourse.juju.is/t/charmcraft-bi-weekly-dev-summary-first-2020w19-20/3074?u=chipaca\r\n[`observe`]: https://operator-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ops.framework.Framework.observe\r\n[`role`]: https://operator-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ops.charm.RelationMeta.role\r\n[`name`]: https://operator-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ops.model.Model.name\r\n\r\n"}
