Even if it has already been applied, it will be a noop.\r\n- If you're working up versions and will continue to apply migrations after 0.24, you can safely apply the migration as long as it's in order (so if there is a migration 0.25, apply this one and then 0.25)\r\n- If you have already applied migrations for 0.25 or above... well it depends :) Either analyze the migrations that you have applied and see if there could be a clash, or open an issue and we'll look at it together.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- Harmonize periodic logs with other job logs (#507)\r\n  If your workflow depend on exact log messages, then you may want to experiment with the new version.

See [the documentation](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/blueprints.html) for details. Note that if you used blueprints from Procrastiate 0.21, this is a **breaking change**.\r\n\r\nAlso, starting with this version, when the worker cannot function correctly (e.g. when it looses access to the database), it will crash instead of entering a half-broken state. This way, you get to define your own restart strategy, with back-off etc, the way you want.\r\n\r\n[`App.with_connector`](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#procrastinate.App.with_connector) lets you create multiple synchronized apps with different connectors, in case you need to support both a sync and an async app.\r\n\r\nIn `procrastinate shell`, a new `list_locks` command lets you find out about task locks that are currently set, to simplify the hunting for longstanding locks.\r\n\r\nSupport for python3.6 has been removed, support for python3.10 has been added.\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been [updated](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/app.html) regarding where you should place your app. In particular, in case you put your app in the module whose `__name__` is `__main__`, a warning is now emitted, because this could lead to issues.\r\n\r\nPeriodic tasks used to all share a lock, so no 2 periodic tasks could run at the same time. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, did you notice ? The repository moved to the `procrastinate-org` organization, yay !\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Second pass on blueprints (#428)\r\n- App.with_connector (#463)\r\n- Add list_locks (#401)\r\n- Remove support for Python 3.6, add support for 3.10 (#470)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Stop the whole worker process when a coroutine raises (#494)\r\n- Add a stack check (#442)\r\n- Null locks are ignored (#402)\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n- Fix longstanding Mypy issues (#490)\r\n- Add croniter-types (#476)\r\n- First wave of CODEOWNERS update (#462)\r\n- Update dev-env (#475)\r\n- Tweaks in the contribution doc (#472)\r\n- Remove a bit of repetition in docs/requirements.txt by using extras (#457)\r\n- Add empty setup.py to counter dependabot bug.

Before running the Migrations for 0.17.0, you're invited to run the following Django code in the Django shell (`manage.py shell`):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\r\n>>> MigrationRecorder.Migration.objects.filter(app=\"procrastinate\", name=\"0001_baseline\").update(name=\"0001_initial\")\r\n``` \r\n\r\nStarting at this release, migrations can be run while the system runs, provided certain conditions are met.\r\nSee [the migrations doc](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/migrations.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nWork on migrations: \r\n\r\n- Use underscores in migration script names (#345)\r\n- Document new rules for database migrations (#342)\r\n- Rename SQL migrations (#347)\r\n- Rename migration: wrong index number (#350)\r\n- Django migrations: generate on the fly via import hooks (#340)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Django migrations, see above.\r\n- ``procrastinate healthchecks`` now doesn't report the number of jobs anymore.

See [doc](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/connections.html).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Synchronous programs can now define a `Psycopg2Connector()` and have real synchronous I/Os, likely to work better with multithreaded programs. See [doc](https://procrastinate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discussions.html#discussion-sync-defer). (#237)\r\n- Default log message contains task result. This means you can `return <something>` in your task to make this `<something>` appear in your logs (#252)\r\n- Make listen/notify optional, through `listen_notify=False` in your worker configuration (#258)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Close race condition in procrastinate_fetch_job (#231)\r\n- Retry on \"server closed connection unexpectedly\" errors (#259)\r\n- Synchronous closing for AiopgConnector (#263)\r\n- Add task.defer as an explicit sync method (#257)\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Documentation \"Quickstart\" section was full of imprecisions (#254)\r\n- Display test results & simplify Tox setup (#253)\r\n- Add function procrastinate_defer_job (#232)\r\n- CONTRIBUTING.rst: more precise wording on release automated steps (#248)\r\n- Update release-drafter.yml (#245)\r\n\r\n## Kudos:\r\n\r\n@elemoine and @ewjoachim\r\n"}
