Backward-compatible safe detail strings are also generated by the new redact-based code for the benefit of networked code using mixed library versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

READ CAREFULLY**\r\n\r\nThe `errors.New()`, `errors.NewWithDepth()`, `errors.Wrap()` and\r\n`errors.WrapWithDepth()` now consider that their string argument do\r\nnot contain PII or unsafe data, and the string is now also included\r\nin Sentry reports.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change if your code uses the included\r\nSentry reporting: in previous versions, only the format\r\nargument to `errors.Newf`, `errors.Wrapf` etc. was considered to be\r\nPII-free and reportable. With the new version, more strings\r\nare considered PII-free and reportable.\r\n\r\nThis also means that **care must be taken when using this `errors`\r\nlibrary as drop-in replacement for other errors libraries**: callers\r\nthat use `New()` and `Wrap()` directly must be audited to ensure that\r\nthey indeed pass strings that are safe for reporting to Sentry.\r\n\r\nThis can be enforced e.g. via linters that assert that the argument is\r\na literal (constant) string. This is the approach taken e.g. in\r\nCockroachDB.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this is discussed here: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/49752\r\nand https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/49660#issuecomment-635879096"}
