Because\r\nwalrus provides high-level abstractions for the Redis data-types/commands, your\r\nwalrus code should work with little or no modifications. Refer to the [list of changes](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py#upgrading-from-redis-py-2x-to-30)\r\nfor more information.\r\n\r\n[redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) added support for stream\r\ncommands as well as zpop/bzpop. As a result, walrus no longer contains separate\r\nimplementations for these commands. For the majority of cases the low-level\r\nmethod signatures and return values are unchanged, notably, the `XREADGROUP`\r\nreturn value is slightly different. The `timeout` parameter, where it was\r\naccepted, has been renamed to `block` for greater compatibility with redis-py.\r\n\r\nPrior to 0.7.0, you would read from a consumer-group (which might contain one\r\nor more streams) and receive a `dict` keyed by the stream, whose value was a\r\nlist of `(message_id, data)` 2-tuples. Going forward, the return value will be\r\na list of `[stream_name, [(message_id, data), ...]]`. To retain the\r\nfunctionality of walrus prior-to 0.7.0, just wrap the return value in a call to\r\nthe `dict` constructor: `ret = dict(consumer_group.read(count=1))`.\r\n\r\n* Added [BloomFilter](https://walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#walrus.Database.bloom_filter)\r\n  container type, which supports `add()` and `contains()`.\r\n* Added a high-level [BitField](https://walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#walrus.BitField)\r\n  container type.\r\n\r\n[View all changes](https://github.com/coleifer/walrus/compare/0.6.4...0.7.0)"}
