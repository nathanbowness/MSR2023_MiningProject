This may be used with the item signs to sell commands.\r\n- Added toitem sign type for towny servers, which acts just like the item type except it uses a town's balance\r\n- Added nitem sign type for towny servers, which acts just like the item type except it uses a nation's balance\r\n\r\nDiscord Module:\r\n- Introduced Discord Module\r\n   - The Discord module ties into DiscordSRV allowing for a set of discord-tailored economy commands to interact with in-game balances from your discord server. It also allows for transaction logging to be enabled to a specific discord channel to key an eye on all transactions happening on your server without the need to log in.\r\n   - Valid commands are:\r\n      - !eco\r\n         - balance\r\n         - balanceother\r\n         - give\r\n         - pay\r\n         - set\r\n         - take\r\n\r\nConversion Module:\r\n- Removed the need for the convert.yml file, we now read directly from your old economy plugin's config file.\r\n   - Now just type /convert <old plugin> and it'll use the old plugin's configuration file to determine the best import solution\r\n- Added mysql support to essentials conversion for servers that use the essentialsmysqldata plugin(courtesy of EnderGamingFilms)\r\n\r\nBug Fixes:\r\n- Fixed conversion module to be stable.\r\n- Fixed issue with world guard\r\n- Fixed issues with the mobs module\r\n- Fixed incompatibility issue\r\n- Fixed MySQL issue\r\n- Fixed issue with /balother command\r\n- Possible fix for crafting errors.\r\n- Fixed issue where named items weren't properly being handled in item shops\r\n- Fixed issue with custom model data comparisons in item signs(this should fix mcmmo potions to be sellable through TNE's default sign shops)\r\n- Fixed issue with /money consolidate not working when auto consolidation was off\r\n- Fixed issue with /money <nick>\r\n - Fixed an issue with the signs module"}
