What does it mean for you? Well, most importantly, you no longer need to pass `--pre`  to RubyGems when installing Asciidoctor EPUB3. And that's basically all. We did, are, and will continue to try to keep backward compatibility so documents will still produce adequate EPUB/MOBI files.\r\n\r\nPossibly even more exciting feature of this release is that Kindlegen is back! Even though Amazon dropped Kindlegen from its webservers, what was put on the Internets stays there forever. Thanks to The Wayback Machine that remembers (almost) everything, we can use it to download Kindlegen binaries.\r\n\r\nNow, a fly in the ointment: Asciidoctor EPUB3 no longer supports Ruby 2.3. It got EOL back in March of 2018 and we continued to support it as long as we could. Today, several of Asciidoctor EPUB3 dependencies already dropped Ruby 2.3 and complexity of its further support is too high for current Asciidoctor EPUB3 development team. Hopefully, three years was enough for everyone to update to newer Ruby!\r\n\r\nAnd please, don't ask what has happened to v1.5.0.\r\n\r\n## Distribution\r\n\r\n- [RubyGem (asciidoctor-epub3)](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-epub3)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* update Font Awesome Solid to 5.15.1\r\n* use CSS for image size scaling instead of `width` attribute (#382)\r\n* use pygments.rb 2.0.0 in CI\r\n* add support for `:back-cover-image:` document attribute (#396)\r\n* reenable Kindlegen support (#363)\r\n* drop support for Ruby 2.3\r\n\r\n## Release meta\r\n\r\nReleased on: 2021-04-29\r\nReleased by: @slonopotamus\r\n\r\nLogs: [resolved issues](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/issues?q=milestone%3Av1.5.1) | [full diff](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/compare/v1.5.0.alpha.19...v1.5.1)\r\n"}
