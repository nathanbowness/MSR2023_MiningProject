fixed: sentences like \"For every woman of who everybody waits.\" now correctly fail\n  - fixed: a bug that in rare cases generated a DRS with duplicate referents\n  - fixed: duplicate DRS conditions are now always suppressed\n  - fixed: misguiding error message for imperatives\n  - deprecated: the construct \"the ... of which/who\"\n- DRS to FOL translation:\n  - fixed: disjunctions related by anaphoric references (e.g. the DRS of \"A man sleeps or the man waits.\") are now correctly mapped to FOL\n- DRS to ACE translation:\n  - improved: handling of disjuntions, e.g. \"Every dog barks or a cat sleeps.\" is now paraphrased as \"A cat sleeps or if there is a dog X1 then the dog X1 barks.\"\n  - restored: support for 0, e.g. \"There are 0 men.\"\n- DRS to OWL/SWRL translation:\n  - the pretty-printed output (owlfsspp) now conforms to the OWL Functional-Style Syntax (and can  be parsed by the OWL-API)\n  - avoid including redundant owl:Thing in intersections\n  - now supported: the DRS of \"John does not see what?\"\n  - fixed: sentences like \"There is X. If X is a fireman then X is a man.\" now map to OWL (instead of SWRL as before)\n  - improved: the SWRL-mapping now supports formula/3 with =<, >=, \\=\n  - fixed: \"Peter owns 3 kg of apples.\" now correctly fails\n- Attempto Java Packages:\n  - updated the Apache HTTP libraries to httpcore-4.1.1.jar and httpclient-4.1.1.jar\n  - removed the OWL Verbalizer Webservice interface, this is now available at owlverbalizer.googlecode.com\n  - updated enum OutputType: removed OWLRDF, added TPTP\n- The APE regression test set (~3500 small ACE texts with their corresponding DRSs) is now included (see ape/acetext_drs.pl)\n- Several improvements to the documentation of ACE, DRS and the APE source code.\n"}
