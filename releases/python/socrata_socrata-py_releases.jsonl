For example:\r\n```python\r\n(ok, revision) = socrata.new({'name': 'cool dataset'})\r\nassert ok, revision\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```python\r\nrevision = socrata.new({'name': 'cool dataset'})\r\n```\r\nIf the operation fails, a `SocrataException` is thrown.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n* Uploads are now done in parallel, using the chunked upload API. They will also be retried if a portion of it fails due to a transient network issue, rather than causing the whole upload to finish.\r\n\r\n# Feature Additions\r\n* None\r\n# Feature Removals\r\n* None\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nUpdate your `requirements.txt` file to reference `socrata-py==1.0.0`. Note that the old version (`0.4.2`) still works just fine, so if you would like to continue using that, make sure your `requirements.txt` file contains `socrata-py==0.4.2`"}
