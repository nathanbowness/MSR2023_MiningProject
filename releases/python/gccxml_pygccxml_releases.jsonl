[New features]\r\n\r\n  * Full Python 3.6 support\r\n\r\n  * Full pypy and pypy3 support\r\n\r\n  * Better windows support\r\n\r\n  * Small performance improvements\r\n\r\n  * Added ```is_struct``` function to declarations package. It returns true if\r\n    a declaration is a struct.\r\n\r\n  * Added support for the castxml epic version format 1.\r\n    This is a new format which is partially not backward compatible with the\r\n    legacy format. To use this new format, use the ```castxml_epic_version``` flag\r\n    and set it to 1.\r\n    This new format will allow to support new c++ features that were not recognized\r\n    by ```gccxml``` and previous versions of ```castxml```.\r\n\r\n  * Added support for elaborated type specifiers.\r\n    A new ```elaborated_t``` type was added, with the related ```is_elaborated```\r\n    and ```remove_elaborated``` function.\r\n    This is only available when setting the ```castxml_epic_version``` flag to 1 .\r\n\r\n2. [Windows]\r\n\r\n  * Add Appveyor Windows build (castxml, VS 2013, python 3.5) and merge coverage\r\n    results with Travis.\r\n\r\n  * Attributes defined as ```__thiscall__``` are now ignored (tested with VS 2013).\r\n    The ```__thiscall__``` in some attributes will be removed too. If you still\r\n    want to have access to these attributes, you can use the\r\n    ```config.flags = [\"f2\"]``` option.\r\n\r\n3. [Deprecations]\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated ```decl``` attribute from ```dependency_info_t```.\r\n    Use the ```declaration``` attribute instead.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated the ```nss```, ```free_fun``` and ```free_funs``` methods from the\r\n    ```namespace_t``` class. Use the ```namespaces```, ```free_function``` and\r\n    ```free_functions``` methods instead.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated the ```mem_fun```, ```mem_funs```, ```mem_oper```, ```mem_opers```,\r\n    ```enum``` and ```enums``` methods from the ```scopedef_t``` class.\r\n    Use the ```member_function```, ```member_functions```, ```member_operator```,\r\n    ```member_operators```, ```enumeration``` and ```enumerations``` methods instead.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated the ```mdecl_wrapper_t.to_list()```. You can implement your own\r\n      version of it if you really need it.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated the ```declaration_not_found_t``` and ```multiple_declarations_found_t```\r\n    attributes from the ```scopedef_t``` class. These exceptions are available\r\n    through the ```pygccxml.declarations``` package.\r\n\r\n  * Deprecated the ```decorated_name``` attribute from ```declaration_t```.\r\n    This was used by the binary parser, which have been removed in this version.\r\n    As these attributes still could be used somewhere (but always returned None\r\n    anyway), they need to go through a deprecation cycle first.\r\n\r\n4. [Removals]\r\n\r\n  * Removed ```utils.xml_generator``` and ```utils.xml_output_version``` attributes.\r\n    These two variables should not have made it into the public API. There is no\r\n    deprecation cycle for these because of the complexity of keeping these\r\n    module attributes around."}

[Deprecations]\r\n  * The ```binary_parsers``` module was deprecated. It seems that this module is not\r\n    used by other third-party projects, at least a quick search on GitHub\r\n    did not give any interesting usage. Also, this code is not tested, and\r\n    there seem to be some undefined variables, so it is highly probable that this\r\n    module is not working anyway.\r\n    I do not want to put much efforts in maintaining this module, but concentrate\r\n    on improving pygccxml's core features. If somebody wants to revive this\r\n    module it can still be done in a separate project.\r\n    Thus, the 3 following functions are now deprecated and will be removed in\r\n    pygccxml 1.9.0: ```merge_information```, ```undecorate_blob``` and ```format_decl```.\r\n    The ```undname_creator_t``` class is also deprecated for the same reason.\r\n\r\n  * A bunch of attributes and methods were deprecated.\r\n   They will throw a warning when used with pygccxml 1.8.0, and will be removed\r\n   in version 1.9.0.\r\n     * In ```class_declaration_t``` and ```class_t```:\r\n       - decl.container_traits attribute => declarations.find_container_traits(decl)\r\n     * In ```class_t```\r\n       - decl.find_noncopyable_vars() method => declarations.find_noncopyable_vars(decl)\r\n       - decl.find_copy_constructor() method => declarations.find_copy_constructor(decl)\r\n       - decl.has_vtable argument => declarations.has_vtable(decl)\r\n     * In ```constructor_t```\r\n       - ctor.is_copy_constructor attribute  => declarations.is_copy_constructor(ctor)\r\n       - ctor.is_trivial_constructor attribute => declarations.is_trivial_constructor(ctor)\r\n\r\n     * Deprecate the ```ns()``` method. The ```namespace()``` method can be used instead.\r\n\r\n     * Deprecate ```etree_scanner_t``` and ```etree_saxifier_t``` classes.\r\n       The most efficient xml scanner class is the ```ietree_scanner_t``` class, which\r\n       is the one used since many years now.\r\n\r\n     * The ```[gccxml]``` section used in the configuration file is now deprecated.\r\n       Please use ```[xml_generator]``` instead.\r\n\r\n  * ```native_compiler``` and ```enum``` classes from the ```utils``` module. These were\r\n     not used in ```pygccxml```, and can easily be implemented in your own project if you\r\n     need and equivalent"}

Added support for CastXML (https://github.com/CastXML/CastXML)\r\n\r\n   GCCXML is deprecated and does no more work with modern compilers.\r\n   CastXML should be used instead.\r\n\r\n   ``pygccxml 1.7.0`` is still compatible with GCCXML and no changes are needed for people working with GCCXML.\r\n\r\n2. [CastXML] A new function was introduced to help find which XML generator you are using.\r\n\r\n   If the generator (GCCXML or CastXML) is in your path, it will be detected.\r\n\r\n    .. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n      generator_path, generator_name = pygccxml.utils.find_xml_generator()\r\n\r\n3. [CastXML] When using the configuration, you will need to tell pygccxml which xml generator you are using.\r\n\r\n    .. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n      xml_generator_config = parser.xml_generator_configuration_t(\r\n        xml_generator_path=generator_path,\r\n        xml_generator=generator_name,\r\n        )\r\n\r\n  ``gccxml_configuration_t`` is an alias of ``xml_generator_configuration_t``.\r\n\r\n  ``load_gccxml_configuration`` is an alias of ``load_xml_generator_configuration``.\r\n\r\n  Both can still be used but will be deprecated.\r\n\r\n4. [CastXML] The compiler path can be passed to castxml.\r\n\r\n   This is done by using the ``compiler_path`` attribute in the configuration.\r\n   Note that this may be important because the resulting xml file is slightly different\r\n   depending on the compiler.\r\n\r\n5. [CastXML] Added support for some fields which have no location.\r\n\r\n   These fields are: ``gp_offset``, ``fp_offset``, ``overflow_arg_area``, ``reg_save_area``\r\n\r\n6. [CastXML] Mangled names are only available for functions and variables with CastXML.\r\n\r\n  Getting the mangled attribute on a ``declaration`` will fail.\r\n\r\n7. [CastXML] Demangled names are not available.\r\n\r\n  Getting a demangled name will fail.\r\n\r\n8. [CastXML] Add new container traits:\r\n\r\n  ``unordered maps``, ``unordered sets``, ``multimaps``, ``multisets``\r\n\r\n9. [CastXML] Annotations:\r\n\r\n  Instead of using the ``__attribute((gccxml(\"string\")))`` c++ syntax (see version 0.9.5), the ``__attribute__ ((annotate (\"out\")))`` can now be used to annotate code with CastXML.\r\n\r\n10. [CastXML] Disabled relinking of:\r\n\r\n    .. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n      rebind<std::__tree_node<std::basic_string<char>, void *> >\r\n\r\n This made the ``find_container_traits_tester`` unit tests fail with ``CastXML``.\r\n This class defintion is present in the clang AST tree, but I don't know why it is\r\n usefull. Please tell me if you need it so we can re-enable that featur in pygccxml.\r\n\r\n11. [Misc] Deprecated the ``compiler`` attribute and replaced it with a global ``utils.xml_generator`` variable.\r\n\r\n The ``compiler`` attribute was misleading; it was sometimes confused with the name and version of the xml generator.\r\n\r\n This change also fixes some internal problems with the algorithms cache.\r\n\r\n12. [Misc] ``declarations.has_trivial_copy`` was defintevely removed.\r\n\r\n  Please use ``declarations.has_copy_constructor``.\r\n\r\n  This was deprecated since version 0.9.5.\r\n\r\n13. [Misc] Remove ``gccxml`` logger from logger class (was deprecated).\r\n\r\n  Please use ``cxx_parser`` instead.\r\n\r\n14. [Misc] Removed ``gccxml_runtime_error_t`` class. This was only used internally.\r\n\r\n  Please use a normal ``RuntimeError`` instead.\r\n\r\n15. [Misc] Documentation was moved to readthedocs.org\r\n\r\n  https://readthedocs.org/projects/pygccxml/\r\n\r\n16. [Misc] Add quantifiedcode check\r\n\r\n  https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/project/117af14ef32a455fb7b3762e21083fb3\r\n\r\n17. [Misc] Add option to keep xml files after errors, which is useful for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\n18. [Misc] Fix new pep8 warnings, clean up and simplify some code and comments\r\n\r\n19. [Misc] The compiler version debugging message is now hidden (closes #12)\r\n\r\n20. [Misc] Print less line separations in ``decl_printer``; this makes the output more compact.\r\n\r\n21. [Tests] Add new test for the ``contains_parent_dir`` function.\r\n\r\n22. [Tests] Add test for non copyable class with const class\r\n\r\n23. [Tests] Add test case for non copyable class due to const array\r\n\r\n24. [Doc] Small documentation update, moved people list to credits page, added new examples.\r\n\r\n25. [Misc] Add Travis unit tests for Python 3.5"}

Use new style python decorators (@property) everywhere\r\n\r\n12. Add new unit test for the example.py file\r\n\r\n13. Update the licence headers to reflect the change in maintainers"}
