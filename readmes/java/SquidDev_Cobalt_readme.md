# Cobalt [![Current build status](https://github.com/SquidDev/Cobalt/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SquidDev/Cobalt/actions "Current build status")

## What?
Cobalt is a fork of LuaJ 2.0 (Lua 5.1) with many features of LuaJ 3.0 backported.

It allows multiple Lua instances to be run at once, with no shared metatables.

## Why?
LuaJ 2.0 had too many bugs, mostly minor but annoying. Cobalt is an attempt to slim down LuaJ (only the JSE will be supported) and fix most of the bugs.

## But Lua 5.1 is outdated!
I am considering having a separate Lua 5.3 branch but that is not an immediate priority right now.
