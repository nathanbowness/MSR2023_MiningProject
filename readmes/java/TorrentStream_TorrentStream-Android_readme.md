TorrentStream-Android [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/TorrentStream/TorrentStream-Android.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TorrentStream/TorrentStream-Android)
======

A torrent streamer library for Android based on [libtorrent4j](https://github.com/aldenml/libtorrent4j).

Once built for the Popcorn Time and the [Butterproject](https://github.com/butterproject/butter-android). Now just a cool library for anyone to use.

## How to use

Add Jitpack in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add to your dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile "com.github.TorrentStream:TorrentStream-Android:${torrentstreamVersion}"
}
```

Add to your AndroidManifest.xml (only for saving to the external storage):

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### Code samples

Create your own `TorrentOptions` instance using the builder and feed it to a new `TorrentStream`.

```java
TorrentOptions torrentOptions = new TorrentOptions.Builder()
                .saveLocation(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS))
                .removeFilesAfterStop(true)
                .build();

TorrentStream torrentStream = TorrentStream.init(torrentOptions);
torrentStream.startStream("https://butterpoject.org/test.torrent");
```

If you want to get status information about the torrent then you might want to use `addListener` to attach a listener to your `TorrentStream` instance.
