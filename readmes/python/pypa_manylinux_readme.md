The goal of the manylinux project is to provide a convenient way to
distribute binary Python extensions as wheels on Linux.
This effort has produced `PEP 513 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`_ (manylinux1),
`PEP 571 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/>`_ (manylinux2010),
`PEP 599 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`_ (manylinux2014) and
`PEP 600 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/>`_ (manylinux_x_y).

PEP 513 defined ``manylinux1_x86_64`` and ``manylinux1_i686`` platform tags
and the wheels were built on Centos5. Centos5 reached End of Life (EOL) on
March 31st, 2017.

PEP 571 defined ``manylinux2010_x86_64`` and ``manylinux2010_i686`` platform
tags and the wheels were built on Centos6. Centos6 reached End of Life (EOL)
on November 30th, 2020.

PEP 599 defines the following platform tags:

- ``manylinux2014_x86_64``

- ``manylinux2014_i686``

- ``manylinux2014_aarch64``

- ``manylinux2014_armv7l``

- ``manylinux2014_ppc64``

- ``manylinux2014_ppc64le``

- ``manylinux2014_s390x``

Wheels are built on CentOS 7 which will reach End of Life (EOL)
on June 30th, 2024.

PEP 600 has been designed to be "future-proof" and does not enforce specific symbols and a specific distro to build.
It only states that a wheel tagged ``manylinux_x_y`` shall work on any distro based on ``glibc>=x.y``.
The manylinux project supports:

- ``manylinux_2_24`` images for ``x86_64``, ``i686``, ``aarch64``, ``ppc64le`` and ``s390x``.

- ``manylinux_2_28`` images for ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``, ``ppc64le`` and ``s390x``.


Wheel packages compliant with those tags can be uploaded to
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`_ (for instance with `twine
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_) and can be installed with
pip:

The various manylinux tags allow projects to distribute wheels that are
automatically installed (and work!) on the vast majority of desktop
and server Linux distributions.

This repository hosts several manylinux-related things:


Docker images
-------------

Building manylinux-compatible wheels is not trivial; as a general
rule, binaries built on one Linux distro will only work on other Linux
distros that are the same age or newer. Therefore, if we want to make
binaries that run on most Linux distros, we have to use an old enough
distro.


Rather than forcing you to install an old distro yourself, install Python,
etc., we provide `Docker <https://docker.com/>`_ images where we've
done the work for you. The images are uploaded to `quay.io`_ and are tagged
for repeatable builds.

All images are rebuilt using GitHub Actions / Travis-CI on every commit to this
repository; see the
`docker/ <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/tree/main/docker>`_
directory for source code.


Image content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All images currently contain:

- CPython 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and PyPy 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 installed in
  ``/opt/python/<python tag>-<abi tag>``. The directories are named
  after the PEP 425 tags for each environment --
  e.g. ``/opt/python/cp37-cp37m`` contains a CPython 3.7 build, and
  can be used to produce wheels named like
  ``<pkg>-<version>-cp37-cp37m-<arch>.whl``.

- Development packages for all the libraries that PEP 571/599 list. One should not assume the presence of any other development package.

- The `auditwheel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/auditwheel>`_ tool

Note that less common or virtually unheard of flag combinations
(such as ``--with-pydebug`` (``d``) and ``--without-pymalloc`` (absence of ``m``)) are not provided.

Note that `starting with CPython 3.8 <https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.8.html#build-and-c-api-changes>`_,
default ``sys.abiflags`` became an empty string: the ``m`` flag for pymalloc
became useless (builds with and without pymalloc are ABI compatible) and so has
been removed. (e.g. ``/opt/python/cp38-cp38``)

Note that PyPy is not available on ppc64le & s390x.

Building Docker images
----------------------

To build the Docker images, please run the following command from the
current (root) directory:

    $ PLATFORM=$(uname -m) POLICY=manylinux2014 COMMIT_SHA=latest ./build.sh

Please note that the Docker build is using `buildx <https://github.com/docker/buildx>`_.

Updating the requirements
-------------------------

The requirement files are pinned and controlled by pip-tools compile. To update
the pins, run nox on a Linux system with all supported versions of Python included.
For example, using a docker image:

    $ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/nox -t quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64:latest pipx run nox -f /nox/noxfile.py -s update_python_dependencies update_python_tools

Updating the native dependencies
--------------------------------

Native dependencies are all pinned in the Dockerfile. To update the pins, run the dedicated
nox session. This will add a commit for each update. If you only want to see what would be
updated, you can do a dry run:

    $ nox -s update_native_dependencies [-- --dry-run]



Example
-------

An example project which builds x86_64 wheels for each Python interpreter
version can be found here: https://github.com/pypa/python-manylinux-demo. The
repository also contains demo to build i686 and x86_64 wheels with ``manylinux1``
tags.

This demonstrates how to use these docker images in conjunction with auditwheel
to build manylinux-compatible wheels using the free `travis ci <https://travis-ci.org/>`_
continuous integration service.

(NB: for the i686 images running on a x86_64 host machine, it's necessary to run
everything under the command line program `linux32`, which changes reported architecture
in new program environment. See `this example invocation
<https://github.com/pypa/python-manylinux-demo/blob/master/.travis.yml#L14>`_)

The PEP itself
--------------

The official version of `PEP 513
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`_ is stored in the `PEP
repository <https://github.com/python/peps>`_, but we also have our
`own copy here
<https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/tree/main/pep-513.rst>`_. This is
where the PEP was originally written, so if for some reason you really
want to see the full history of edits it went through, then this is
the place to look.

The proposal to upgrade ``manylinux1`` to ``manylinux2010`` after Centos5
reached EOL was discussed in `PEP 571 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/>`_.

The proposal to upgrade ``manylinux2010`` to ``manylinux2014`` was
discussed in `PEP 599 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`_.

The proposal for a "future-proof" ``manylinux_x_y`` definition was
discussed in `PEP 600 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/>`_.

This repo also has some analysis code that was used when putting
together the original proposal in the ``policy-info/`` directory.

If you want to read the full discussion that led to the original
policy, then lots of that is here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/manylinux-discuss

The distutils-sig archives for January 2016 also contain several
threads.
