We are next working on [stabilizing the API](https://github.com/biota/sourcetracker2/issues/31), [generating the plots provided by the R version of sourcetracker](https://github.com/biota/sourcetracker2/issues/12), and other features.\n\nPlease be aware that this is an alpha release, and as such you may find bugs. The command line interface should not yet be considered stable, but we'll do our best to minimize backward-incompatible changes. We're very interested in receving bug reports and feature requests, both of which can be submitted through [our issue tracker](https://github.com/biota/sourcetracker2/issues). \n\nEnjoy! \n"}
