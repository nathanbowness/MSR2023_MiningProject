This release captures the latest updates prior to such major change and is known to work, albeit with known issues. The most annoying bugs have been fixed so far:\n1. agents now work cross platform: #62 \n2. agents now always build in non-verbose mode on both windows and linux #75 \n3. Maven install no longer reports any error: #68 and #69 \n4. commandline options are now handled with jcommander: #51 \n5. build has been switched from ant to maven #42 \n\nOur current goal is to fix all remaining issues, cleanup the parser and design and implement a new logger and/or configuration management for agent building. We will also be introducing some continous integration soon. These will produce a JavaMOP which is clean, reliable, easy to use, well tested and documented, and easy to deploy and maintain. \n"}
