However, some cases popped up where this wasn't working due to bizarre BLAST behaviour.\r\n* Now, we use [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) to translate the assembly's gene sequence and the reference alleles, and then look for a match in the translate sequences. This seems more robust!\r\n\r\nAdditionally we fixed a bug that occurred in an annoying corner-case:\r\n* Previously, if an allele had a mutated start/stop codon, exact amino acid matches could be missed. This happened because a change at the very start/end of the gene sequence would result in a not-quite-full-length nucleotide match.\r\n* Now, mutated start/stop codons can still give the appropriate exact amino acid match."}
