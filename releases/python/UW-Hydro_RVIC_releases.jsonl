In the case where a more suitable channel location is found, the pour point is moved and a warning message is printed.  This option is only available when `AGGREGATE=False`.\n"}

This means, you can import pieces of the rvic code like any other Python module.  More information on importing the `rvic` module can be found [here](https://github.com/jhamman/RVIC/wiki/RVIC-Wiki#using-rvic).\n- After building, a top level executable script `rvic` will be available (installed something like `/usr/bin` or in your virtual environment bin directory.  This is the best way to run rvic from the command line.  Type `rvic -h for run  options.  More information on this script can be found [here](https://github.com/jhamman/RVIC/wiki/RVIC-Wiki#using-rvic).\n\n**New features:**\n- Support for partially full history files.\n- Support for additional output units.\n- Correctly handle latitude dimension order discrepancies between input data sources.  \n- Support for netCDF4 compression options.\n- Testing harness for unit, system, and continuous integration.  \n"}
