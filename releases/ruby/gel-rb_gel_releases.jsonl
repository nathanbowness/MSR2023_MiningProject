It contains a broad accumulation of API compatibility improvements as well as several new features (including e.g. `gel install-gem rubocop` to system-install a gem without a lockfile). If you're upgrading or installing on a system that previously had an earlier version of Gel present, please see the following notes on compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Incompatibility: SDBM support removed** \r\nIf you've been using an older version exclusively with Ruby 3.0 or earlier, you might have been using the SDBM store format (`~/.local/gel/ruby/libs.pag` instead of `~/.local/gel/ruby/libs.pstore`). SDBM support was removed from the Ruby stdlib in 3.1 -- so any instance that was working with current Ruby versions has already made this transition -- but this release fully drops support for SDBM, even when running on older Rubies. If you're in this situation, I'm afraid you'll need to delete your `~/.local/gel` store and re-`gel install` inside your application directories; a database conversion script was unfortunately impractical in this case.\r\n\r\n**More reliable datastore management**\r\nEarlier versions could occasionally lose track of some files that had been installed as part of a gem, which would generally manifest as those files being missed by the fast-path `require` handler and falling back to a Ruby LOAD_PATH scan. While v0.8 will work with (non-SDBM) datastores generated by v0.3, if you encounter any misbehaviour (or just prefer to start from a more confidently-correct base), please consider resetting the datastore (`rm -rf ~/.local/gel`; `gel install`).\r\n\r\n**Improved binstubs**\r\nv0.8 retains compatibility with v0.3-generated binstubs, but it now generates using a new, better, template: it's more POSIX-compliant, it's compatible with `ruby -S`, and it can bootstrap into a Gel environment when run from a non-Gel Ruby instance. If you have not reset your datastore for either of the above reasons, and your binstubs work, you're welcome to keep them as they are -- but you can also `gel stub --rebuild` to easily rewrite all the binstubs into the new format.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gel-rb/gel/releases/71551304/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 6, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 3, "eyes": 0}}
