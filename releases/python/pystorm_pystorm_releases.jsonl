Otherwise, it has a couple handy logging-related features.\n\n## :warning:  API Breaking Changes :warning:\n- `need_task_ids` defaults to `False` instead of `True` in all `emit()` method calls.  If you were previously storing the task IDs that your tuples were emitted to (which is pretty rare), then you must pass `need_task_ids=True` in your `emit()` calls.  This should provide a little speed boost to most users, because we do not need to wait on a return message from Storm for every emitted tuple.\n- Instead of having `pystorm.log.level` influence the root logger's level, only your component (and its `StormHandler` if you haven't set `pystorm.log.path`)'s levels will be set.\n-  When `pystorm.log.path` is not set, pystorm will no longer issue warning about how you should set it; instead, it will automatically set up a `StormHandler` and log everything directly to your Storm logs.  This is really handy as in Storm 1.0 there's support through the UI for searching logs.\n\n## Features\n-  Added support for custom log filenames via `pystorm.log.file` (PR #25  \u2014 thanks @ kalmanolah)\n-  Added support for custom log format strings via `pystorm.log.format` (PR #33)\n-  Automatically log to Storm when `pystorm.log.path` is not set (PR #32)\n-  `__version__` is directly available under the `pystorm` namespace instead of just in `pystorm.version`\n-  `need_task_ids` defaults to `False`, which should provide a speed boost, as discussed above (Issue #29, PR #31)\n\n## Fixes\n-  Add missing `_reader_lock` in `msgpack_serializer`.  This could have caused task IDs to not match with emits if using `need_task_ids`, multithreading, and the msgpack serializer.  (PR #28)\n- Simplified `emit` logic, so that we only request `_reader_lock` if `need_task_ids` is `True` (PR #23)\n- Added missing `TicklessBatchingBolt` to `__all__` in  `__init__.py`.\n"}

Code based on Pyleus's. (Issue #5, PR #1)\n-  Added `exit_on_exception` flag to `Component` class, so you can disable calling `sys.exit` when there's an exception (while still failing the tuple). (Issue #16, PR #17)\n- Now `StormWentAwayErrors` are only logged at the `INFO` level before `sys.exit` is called.  This is to prevent sentry fatigue. (Issue #12, PR #13)\n"}
