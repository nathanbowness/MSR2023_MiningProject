(PR #75)\r\n- We fixed a bug related to the `--local-directory` CLI option which was annoyingly preventing all of our other PRs from passing and therefore being merged.  Ugh!  Thanks to @kmpaul!  (PR #77)\r\n- We also fixed another behavioral issue related to the `scheduler_ip` argument to the Worker CLI.  Thanks to @jacobtomlinson!  (PR #79)\r\n- Dask-MPI's documentation is now using the newest and awesomest documentation theme!  Yay!  Thanks to @jacobtomlinson!  (PR #80)\r\n- And finally, we are getting around to modernizing our release process!  We've added the automated PyPI release action to Dask-MPI's GitHub workflows!  Thanks to @kmpaul and @jacobtomlinson! (PR #81)\r\n\r\nEnjoy and thanks for using and contributing to Dask-MPI!", "mentions_count": 3}
