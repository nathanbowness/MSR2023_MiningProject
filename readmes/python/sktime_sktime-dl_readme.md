sktime-dl is being ported over to sktime.

TensorFlow is now a soft dependency in sktime, so we are going to initially just port
these classifiers over. We have not been very good at maintaining this repo, so
hopefully it will be easier when it is part of sktime proper. We would welcome any
contributors to deep learning components over there.

The first PR into sktime is here
https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pull/2447
