In summary: the API for estimates doesn't change depending on what your censoring your dataset is.\r\n\r\n##### Bug fixes\r\n - Fixed an annoying bug where at_risk-table label's were not aligning properly when data spanned large ranges. See merging PR for details.\r\n - Fixed a bug in `find_best_parametric_model` where the wrong BIC value was being computed.\r\n - Fixed regression bug when using an array as a penalizer in Cox models."}

See docs [here]().\r\n - `plot_covariate_group` now can plot other y-values like hazards and cumulative hazards (default: survival function).\r\n - `CoxPHFitter` now accepts late entries via `entry_col`.\r\n - `calibration.survival_probability_calibration` now works with out-of-sample data.\r\n - `print_summary` now accepts a `column` argument to filter down the displayed values. This helps with clutter in notebooks, latex, or on the terminal.\r\n - `add_at_risk_counts` now follows the cool new KMunicate suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n##### API Changes\r\n - With the introduction of formulas, all models can be using formulas under the hood.\r\n    - For both custom regression models or non-AFT regression models, this means that you no longer need to add a constant column to your DataFrame (instead add a `1` as a formula string in the `regressors` dict). You may also need to remove the T and E columns from `regressors`. I've updated the models in the `\\examples` folder with examples of this new model building.\r\n - Unfortunately, if using formulas, your model will not be able to be pickled. This is a problem with an upstream library, and I hope to have it resolved in the near future.\r\n - `plot_covariate_groups` has been deprecated in favour of `plot_partial_effects_on_outcome`.\r\n - The baseline in `plot_covariate_groups` has changed from the *mean* observation (including dummy-encoded categorical variables) to *median* for ordinal (including continuous) and *mode* for categorical.\r\n - Previously, *lifelines* used the label `\"_intercept\"` to when it added a constant column in regressions. To align with Patsy, we are now using `\"Intercept\"`.\r\n - In AFT models, `ancillary_df` kwarg has been renamed to `ancillary`. This reflects the more general use of the kwarg (not always a DataFrame, but could be a boolean or string now, too).\r\n - Some column names in datasets shipped with lifelines have changed.\r\n - The never used \"lifelines.metrics\" is deleted.\r\n - With the introduction of formulas, `plot_covariate_groups` (now called `plot_partial_effects_on_outcome`) behaves differently for transformed variables. Users no longer need to add \"derivatives\" features, and encoding is done implicitly. See docs [here](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Survival%20Regression.html#plotting-the-effect-of-varying-a-covariate).\r\n - all exceptions and warnings have moved to `lifelines.exceptions`\r\n\r\n##### Bug fixes\r\n - The p-value of the log-likelihood ratio test for the CoxPHFitter with splines was returning the wrong result because the degrees of freedom was incorrect.\r\n - better `print_summary` logic in IDEs and Jupyter exports.

Pandas 1.0 is fully supported, along with previous version. Minimum Scipy has been bumped to 1.2.0\r\n\r\n##### New features\r\n - `CoxPHFitter` and `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` has support for an elastic net penalty, which includes L1 and L2 regression.\r\n - `CoxPHFitter` has new baseline survival estimation methods. Specifically, `spline` now estimates the coefficients and baseline survival using splines. The traditional method, `breslow`, is still the default however.\r\n - Regression models have a new `score` method that will score your model against a dataset (ex: a testing or validation dataset). The default is to evaluate the log-likelihood, but also the concordance index can be chose.\r\n - New `MixtureCureFitter` for quickly creating univariate mixture models.\r\n - Univariate parametric models have a `plot_density`, `density_at_times`, and property `density_` that computes the probability density function estimates.\r\n - new dataset for interval regression involving C. Botulinum.\r\n - new `lifelines.fitters.mixins.ProportionalHazardMixin` that implements proportional hazard checks.\r\n\r\n##### API Changes\r\n - Models' prediction method that return a single array now return a Series (use to return a DataFrame). This includes `predict_median`, `predict_percentile`, `predict_expectation`, `predict_log_partial_hazard`, and possibly others.\r\n - The penalty in Cox models is now scaled by the number of observations. This makes it invariant to changing sample sizes. This change also make the penalty magnitude behave the same as any parametric regression model.\r\n - `score_` on models has been renamed `concordance_index_`\r\n - models' `.variance_matrix_` is now a DataFrame.\r\n - `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` no longer requires an `id_col`. It's optional, and some checks may be done for integrity if provided.\r\n - Significant changes to `utils.k_fold_cross_validation`.\r\n - removed automatically adding `inf` from `PiecewiseExponentialRegressionFitter.breakpoints` and `PiecewiseExponentialFitter.breakpoints`\r\n - `tie_method` was dropped from Cox models (it was always Efron anyways...)\r\n - Mixins are moved to `lifelines.fitters.mixins`\r\n - `find_best_parametric_model` `evaluation` kwarg has been changed to `scoring_method`.\r\n - removed `_score_` and `path` from Cox model.\r\n\r\n##### Bug fixes\r\n - Fixed `show_censors` with `KaplanMeierFitter.plot_cumulative_density` see issue #940.\r\n - Fixed error in `\"BIC\"` code path in `find_best_parametric_model`\r\n - Fixed a bug where left censoring in AFT models was not converging well\r\n - Cox models now incorporate any penalizers in their `log_likelihood_`\r\n\r\n"}

Docs have been added to our [documentation](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/) about how to use `WeibullAFTFitter` (spoiler: it's API is similar to the other regression models) and how to interpret the output.\r\n - `CoxPHFitter` performance improvements (about 10%)\r\n - `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` performance improvements (about 10%)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### API changes\r\n - **Important**: we changed the `.hazards_` and `.standard_errors_` on Cox models to be pandas Series (instead of Dataframes). This felt like a more natural representation of them. You may need to update your code to reflect this. See notes here: https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues/636\r\n - **Important**: we changed the `.confidence_intervals_` on Cox models to be transposed. This felt like a more natural representation of them. You may need to update your code to reflect this. See notes here: https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues/636\r\n - **Important**: we changed the parameterization of the `WeibullFitter` and `ExponentialFitter` from `\\lambda * t` to `t / \\lambda`. This was for a few reasons: 1) it is a more common parameterization in literature, 2) it helps in convergence.\r\n - **Important**: in models where we add an intercept (currently only `AalenAdditiveModel`), the name of the added column has been changed from `baseline` to `_intercept`\r\n - **Important**: the meaning of `alpha` in all fitters has changed to be the standard interpretation of alpha in confidence intervals. That means that the _default_ for alpha is set to 0.05 in the latest lifelines, instead of 0.95 in previous versions.\r\n\r\n##### Bug Fixes\r\n - Fixed a bug in the `_log_likelihood_` property of `ParametericUnivariateFitter` models. It was showing the \"average\" log-likelihood (i.e. scaled by 1/n) instead of the total. It now displays the total.\r\n - In model `print_summary`s, correct a label erroring. Instead of \"Likelihood test\", it should have read \"Log-likelihood test\".\r\n - Fixed a bug that was too frequently rejecting the dtype of `event` columns.\r\n - Fixed a calculation bug in the concordance index for stratified Cox models. Thanks @airanmehr!\r\n - Fixed some Pandas <0.24 bugs."}

This enables atleast i) using non-integer weights in the model (these could be sampling weights like IPTW), and ii) mis-specified models (ex: non-proportional hazards). Under the hood it's a sandwich estimator. This does not handle ties, so if there are high number of ties, results may significantly differ from other software.\r\n - `standard_errors_` is now a property on fitted `CoxPHFitter` which describes the standard errors of the coefficients.\r\n - `variance_matrix_` is now a property on fitted `CoxPHFitter` which describes the variance matrix of the coefficients.\r\n - new criteria for convergence of `CoxPHFitter` and `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` called the Newton-decrement. Tests show it is as accurate (w.r.t to previous coefficients) and typically shaves off a single step, resulting in generally faster convergence. See https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/convexopt/Lecture_Slides/Newton_methods.pdf. Details about the Newton-decrement are added to the `show_progress` statements.\r\n - Minimum suppport for scipy is 1.0\r\n - Convergence errors in models that use Newton-Rhapson methods now throw a `ConvergenceError`, instead of a `ValueError` (the former is a subclass of the latter, however).\r\n - `AalenAdditiveModel` raises `ConvergenceWarning` instead of printing a warning.\r\n - `KaplanMeierFitter` now has a cumulative plot option. Example `kmf.plot(invert_y_axis=True)`\r\n - a `weights_col` option has been added to `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` that allows for time-varying weights. \r\n - `WeibullFitter` has a new `show_progress` param and additional information if the convergence fails. \r\n - `CoxPHFitter`, `ExponentialFitter`, `WeibullFitter` and `CoxTimeVaryFitter` method `print_summary` is updated with new fields. \r\n - `WeibullFitter` has renamed the incorrect `_jacobian` to `_hessian_`. \r\n - `variance_matrix_` is now a property on fitted `WeibullFitter` which describes the variance matrix of the parameters.\r\n - The default `WeibullFitter().timeline` has changed from integers between the min and max duration to _n_ floats between the max and min durations, where _n_ is the number of observations. \r\n - Performance improvements for `CoxPHFitter` (~20% faster)\r\n - Performance improvements for `CoxTimeVaryingFitter` (~100% faster)\r\n - In Python3, Univariate models are now serialisable with `pickle`. Thanks @dwilson1988 for the contribution. For Python2, `dill` is still the preferred method.\r\n - `baseline_cumulative_hazard_` (and derivatives of that) on `CoxPHFitter` now correctly incorporate the `weights_col`. \r\n - Fixed a bug in `KaplanMeierFitter` when late entry times lined up with death events. Thanks @pzivich\r\n - Adding `cluster_col` argument to `CoxPHFitter` so users can specify groups of subjects/rows that may be correlated. \r\n - Shifting the \"signficance codes\" for p-values down an order of magnitude. (Example, p-values between 0.1 and 0.05 are not noted at all and p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 are noted with `.`, etc.). This deviates with how they are presented in other software. There is an argument to be made to remove p-values from lifelines altogether (_become the changes you want to see in the world_ lol), but I worry that people could compute the p-values by hand incorrectly, a worse outcome I think. So, this is my stance. P-values between 0.1 and 0.05 offer _very_ little information, so they are removed. There is a growing movement in statistics to shift \"signficant\" findings to p-values less than 0.01 anyways. \r\n - New fitter for cumulative incidence of multiple risks `AalenJohansenFitter`. Thanks @pzivich! See \"Methodologic Issues When Estimating Risks in Pharmacoepidemiology\" for a nice overview of the model. "}

Given a percentile, p, this function returns the value t such that _S(t | x) = p_. It is a generalization of `predict_median`. \n- Additional kwargs in `k_fold_cross_validation` that will accept different prediction methods (default is `predict_median`). \n- Bug fix in CoxPHFitter `predict_expectation` function. \n- Correct spelling mistake in newton-rhapson algorithm.\n- `datasets` now contains functions for generating the respective datasets, ex: `generate_waltons_dataset`.\n- Bumping up the number of samples in statistical tests to prevent them from failing so often (this a stop-gap)\n- pep8 everything\n"}
