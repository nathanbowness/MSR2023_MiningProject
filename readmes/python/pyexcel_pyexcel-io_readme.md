Introduction
================================================================================

**pyexcel-io** provides **one** application programming interface(API) to read
and write the data in excel format, import the data into and export the data
from database. It provides support for csv(z) format, django database and
sqlalchemy supported databases. Its supported file formats are extended to cover
"xls", "xlsx", "ods" by the following extensions:

.. _file-format-list:
.. _a-map-of-plugins-and-file-formats:

.. table:: A list of file formats supported by external plugins

Plugin shopping guide
------------------------

Since 2020, all pyexcel-io plugins have dropped the support for python versions
which are lower than 3.6. If you want to use any of those Python versions, please use pyexcel-io
and its plugins versions that are lower than 0.6.0.


Except csv files, xls, xlsx and ods files are a zip of a folder containing a lot of
xml files

The dedicated readers for excel files can stream read


In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

.. [#f1] zipped csv file
.. [#f2] zipped tsv file

If you need to manipulate the data, you might do it yourself or use its brother
library `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`__ .

If you would like to extend it, you may use it to write your own
extension to handle a specific file format.




Installation
================================================================================

You can install pyexcel-io via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyexcel-io


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-io.git
    $ cd pyexcel-io
    $ python setup.py install



Development guide
================================================================================

Development steps for code changes

#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-io.git
#. cd pyexcel-io

Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:

#. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

Then install relevant development requirements:

#. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
#. pip install -r requirements.txt
#. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
and update changelog.yml

.. note::

    As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
    library is not released. Once the dependecy is installed
    (will be released), the future
    version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.


How to test your contribution
------------------------------

Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is adviable that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development releases.

On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::

    $ make

On Windows, please issue this command::

    > test.bat


Before you commit
------------------------------

Please run::

    $ make format

so as to beautify your code otherwise your build may fail your unit test.
