# Welcome To PARSEC

**PARSEC** is the **P**latform **A**bst**R**action for **SEC**urity, an open-source initiative
to provide a common API to hardware security and cryptographic services in a platform-agnostic way. This abstraction layer keeps workloads decoupled from physical platform details, enabling cloud-native delivery flows within the data center and at the edge.

Read the Parsec documentation [**online**](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/).

# Why PARSEC?

Use Parsec when you need:

- A **portable interface to your platform's Root of Trust** in order to manage keys and perform cryptographic operations without knowledge of the hardware.
- A simple and portable way to access the **best available security** of your platform in your **preferred programming language**.

# What PARSEC Provides

The value proposition of Parsec is that it provides the following:

- **Abstraction** ‚Äì a common API that is truly agnostic and based on modern cryptographic principles
- **Mediation** ‚Äì security as a microservice, brokering access to the hardware and providing isolated key stores in a multi-tenant environment
- **Ergonomics** ‚Äì a client library ecosystem that brings the API to the fingertips of developers in any programming language: ‚Äúeasy to consume, hard to get wrong‚Äù
- **Openness** ‚Äì an open-source project inviting contributions to enhance the ecosystem both within the service and among its client libraries
