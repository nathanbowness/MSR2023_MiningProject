# COVID-19 Spread Simulator for Tracing App
# **NOTE: This repository is deprecated. It is handed off to [COVI-Canada](https://github.com/Covi-Canada), and further work is being done in that repository.**

_**This was the original repository for the simulator. The attempt to transfer it to [COVI-Canada](https://github.com/Covi-Canada) lead to the loss of various forks, all of which will have no parent now. After realising this mistake, I have made this repository public with the deprecation note above.**_


This is a sub-project of [Peer-to-Peer AI Tracing App](https://mila.quebec/en/peer-to-peer-ai-tracing-of-covid-19/) delegated by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/). Read more about the app in Prof. Bengio's [blog post](https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/03/23/peer-to-peer-ai-tracing-of-covid-19/).

The simulator is built using [`simpy`](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/index.html).
It simulates human mobility along with infectious disease (COVID) spreading in a city, where city has houses, grocery stores, parks, workplaces, and other non-essential establishments.

Human mobility simulation is based on Spatial-EPR model. More details on this model are [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9166) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1760).

The infection spread in this simulator is modeled according to what is known about COVID-19.
The assumptions about the COVID-19 spread and mobility implemented in the simulator are in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn8dOXgmVRX62Ux-jBSuReayATrzrd5XZS2LJuQ2hLs/edit?usp=sharing).
The same document also details our current understanding of COVID-19.
Our understanding is based on the published research as well as interactions with the epidemiologists.
We plan to update the simulator as more and more about COVID-19 will be known.


## Dependencies
To install the simulator without `ctt`
```
pip install .
```

To install the simulator with [`ctt`](https://github.com/nasimrahaman/ctt)
```
pip install '.[ctt]'
```

Please checkout `setup.py` for external dependencies.

## How to run it using command line?
Run the simulator as -
```
python run.py sim --n_people 100 --seed 0
```

The simulator will output a logfile to `output/sim_people-{N_PEOPLE}_days-{SIMULATION_DAYS}_init-{INIT_PERCENT_SICK}_seed-{SEED}_{DATE}-{TIME}/data.zip`. It is a .zip file of `list` of `dict` pickles which contains a log of the mobility activity of a population of humans in `simulator.py`.

Run the risk prediction algorithms as -
```
python risk_prediction.py
```
This file reads in the logs that are output from the simulator, and runs a risk prediction algorithm based on:
 1) The reported symptoms of that individual, given they have the app.
 2) The encounters that individual had (which contain quantized user ids and risk levels).
 3) The risk update messages that are sent when a previously encountered user's risk level changes significantly.

You may select the model which you want to specify, or add your own model in that file.
This file also handles clustering of messages (under the currently understood privacy model), which can be useful for risk prediction algorithms which
depend on knowing how many contacts happened with one individual.

## How to run tests?
Run -
```
python run.py test
```

### Parameters

```
@click.option('--n_people', help='population of the city', type=int, default=100)
@click.option('--simulation_days', help='number of days to run the simulation for', type=int, default=30)
@click.option('--out_chunk_size', help='number of events per dump in outfile', type=int, default=2500, required=False)
@click.option('--outdir', help='the directory to write data to', type=str, default="output", required=False)
@click.option('--seed', help='seed for the process', type=int, default=0)
@click.option('--n_jobs', help='number of parallel procs to query the risk servers with', type=int, default=1)
@click.option('--port', help='which port should we look for inference servers on', type=int, default=6688)
@click.option('--config', help='which experiment config would we like to run with', type=str, default="configs/naive_config.yml")
```

### Accessing Simulation Data
Load the output of the simulator as following
```
data = pickle.load(open("output/data.pkl", 'rb'))
```

## How to run it as a function?
Although not designed with this usage in mind one can still call it like this
```
from run import simulate
monitors = simulate(n_stores=100, n_parks=50, n_people=100, n_misc=100, print_progress=False, seed=0)
```

`data` is a `list` of `dict`.

## Semantics of code
`Human` class builds people, and `Location` class builds stores, parks, workplaces, households, and non-essential establishments.

## Semantics of Data
`data` is a `list`. Each entry in the `list` is an event represented as a `dict`.
The detailed information about events is in [docs/events.md](docs/events.md)

Please get in touch with me at [pgupta@turing.ac.uk](pgupta@turing.ac.uk). There are several people working on it, so it will be the best use of everyone's time and effort if we all work on different aspects of this project.

Some areas that need work are listed [here](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). We track and manage our tasks using [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11t1T66AAVeR6P341nZYP1qwLdvhCkU_EwFwUkyLziLQ/edit?usp=sharing).
