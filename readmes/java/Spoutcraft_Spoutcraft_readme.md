Spoutcraft
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Spoutcraft/Spoutcraft.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Spoutcraft/Spoutcraft)  
Spoutcraft is a Minecraft client mod that provides users with a simple and more customizable Minecraft experience. Servers running SpoutcraftPlugin push content to Spoutcraft users as needed; such as custom items, blocks, and user skins, capes, and other accessories. Players can then enjoy custom server experiences without having to manually modify their client for each server.
