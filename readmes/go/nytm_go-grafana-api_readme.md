# ⚠️ Deprecated ⚠️

This library is now deprecated, though will be left as-is for those still using it in an archived state.

The [grafana/grafana-api-golang-client](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-api-golang-client), though also deprecated, is most up-to-date and likely where Grafana will announce their newest library for working with the Grafana API.
