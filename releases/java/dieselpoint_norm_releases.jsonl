Almost all databases support the MERGE command. But not MySql. Thanks, MySql. Let's all move to Postgres, shall we?\n\nThis release also includes:\n- Support for @Column \n- A new, non-standard annotation, @DbSerializable.\n- Support for primitive classes (Integer, Long, String) as POJOs.\n- Better support for Enum fields. \n\nSee the docs for more.\n"}
