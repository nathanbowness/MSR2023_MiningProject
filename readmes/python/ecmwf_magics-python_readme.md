Magics is the latest generation of the ECMWF's meteorological plotting software and can be either
accessed directly through its Python or Fortran interfaces or by using Metview.


Features:

- supports plotting of contours, wind fields, observations, satellite images, symbols, text, axis and graphs (including boxplots)
- can plot GRIB 1 and 2 coded data, gaussian grid, regularly spaced grid and fitted data

Limitations:

- development stage: **Alpha**,


Installation
------------

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install Magics


System dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The python module depends on the ECMWF *Magics* and *eccodes* libraries

They can be installed from PyPI with::
     $ pip install ecmwflibs



You may run a simple selfcheck command to ensure that your system is set up correctly::

    $ python -m Magics selfcheck
    Found: Magics 'Magics 4.10.0'.
    Library: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ecmwflibs/.dylibs/libMagPlus.dylib
    Magics home: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ecmwflibs
    Your system is ready.


Usage
-----

First, you need a well-formed GRIB file, if you don't have one at hand you can download our
a 2m temperature grib file::

    $ wget http://download.ecmwf.int/test-data/magics/2m_temperature.grib


You may try out the high level API in a python interpreter::



   from Magics import macro as magics

   name = 'magics'
   #Setting of the output file name
   output = magics.output(output_formats = ['png'],
    		output_name_first_page_number = "off",
    		output_name = "magics")

   #Import the  data
   data =  magics.mgrib(grib_input_file_name  = "2m_temperature.grib", )

   #Apply an automatic styling
   contour = magics.mcont( contour_automatic_setting = "ecmwf", )
   coast = magics.mcoast()
   magics.plot(output, data, contour, coast)


Running the test program will create a png named magics.png
