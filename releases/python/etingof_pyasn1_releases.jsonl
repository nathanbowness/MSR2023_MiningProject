WITH COMPONENTS` constraint support.\r\n\r\n- Added `WithComponentsConstraint` along with related\r\n  `ComponentPresentConstraint` and `ComponentAbsentConstraint` classes\r\n  to be used with `Sequence`/`Set` types representing\r\n  `SET ... WITH COMPONENTS ...` like ASN.1 constructs.\r\n\r\nThe other important change is that `sizeSpec` attribute of ASN.1 objects is now deprecated\r\nin favor of uniform `subtypeSpec`, which is now used for all constraints.\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `subtypeSpec` attributes and keyword argument. It is now\r\n  recommended to pass `ValueSizeConstraint`, as well as all other constraints,\r\n  to `subtypeSpec`.\r\n- Added `isInconsistent` property to all constructed types. This property\r\n  conceptually replaces `verifySizeSpec` method to serve a more general\r\n  purpose e.g. ensuring all required fields are in a good shape. By default\r\n  this check invokes subtype constraints verification and is run by codecs\r\n  on value de/serialisation.\r\n\r\nIn the bug fixes department we have just one fix:\r\n\r\n- Fixed a design bug in a way of how the items assigned to constructed\r\n  types are verified. Now if `Asn1Type`-based object is assigned, its\r\n  compatibility is verified based on having all tags and constraint\r\n  objects as the type in field definition. When a bare Python value is\r\n  assigned, then field type object is cloned and initialized with the\r\n  bare value (constraints verificaton would run at this moment).\r\n\r\nComplete list of changes can be found in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etingof/pyasn1/blob/master/CHANGES.rst).\r\n\r\n"}

Before this change,\r\n  `SequenceOf`/`SetOf` instances immediately become value objects behaving\r\n  like an empty list. With this change, `SequenceOf`/`SetOf` objects\r\n  remain schema objects unless a component is added or `.clear()` is\r\n  called.\r\n  This change can potentially cause incompatibilities with existing\r\n  pyasn1 objects which assume `SequenceOf`/`SetOf` instances are value\r\n  objects right upon instantiation.\r\n  The behaviour of `Sequence`/`Set` types depends on the `componentType`\r\n  initializer: if no `componentType` is given, the behavior is the\r\n  same as `SequenceOf`/`SetOf` have. If `componentType` is given, but\r\n  neither optional nor defaulted components are present, created\r\n  instance remains being the schema object. If, however, either optional or\r\n  defaulted component is present, created instance immediately\r\n  becomes a value object.\r\n- Added `.reset()` method to all constructed types to turn value object\r\n  into a schema object.\r\n\r\nAlso, a couple of minor usability improvements:\r\n\r\n- Added `omitEmptyOptionals` option which is respected by `Sequence`\r\n  and `Set` encoders. When `omitEmptyOptionals` is set to `True`, empty\r\n  initialized optional components are not encoded. Default is `False`.\r\n- Added `PyAsn1UnicodeDecodeError`/`PyAsn1UnicodeDecodeError` exceptions\r\n  to help the caller treating unicode errors happening internally\r\n  to pyasn1 at the upper layers.\r\n- Added support for subseconds CER/DER encoding edge cases in\r\n  `GeneralizedTime` codec.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, bug fixes \\o/\r\n\r\n- Fixed 3-digit fractional seconds value CER/DER encoding of\r\n  `GeneralizedTime`.\r\n- Fixed `AnyDecoder` to accept possible `TagMap` as `asn1Spec`\r\n  to make dumping raw value operational\r\n\r\nComplete list of changes can be found in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etingof/pyasn1/blob/master/CHANGES.rst).\r\n"}
