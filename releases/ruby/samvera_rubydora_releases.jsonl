This helps greatly in handling large files.\n\nPreviously, rubydora read the entire file content into a string\nand passed the string to rest-client, so the original file remained open.\nSince `rest-client` closes the file, the changed methods alter the state\nof passed in file/io objects. Hence, the major version bump.\n"}
