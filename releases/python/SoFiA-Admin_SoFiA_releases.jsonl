It introduces a major new feature and comes with several urgent bug fixes.\r\n\r\nThe major new feature is the ability to re-apply the noise normalisation in every single iteration of the S+C finder after smoothing of the cube. Such a feature can be useful in situations where large-scale artefacts such as continuum residuals or sidelobes are present in a data cube.\r\n\r\nIn addition, several bugs have been fixed that resulted in SoFiA crashing under various circumstances. Several known issues still exist that will be addressed in the upcoming stable release 1.4, including problems with Busy Function fitting and minor issues with the CNHI finder and linker.\r\n\r\nA more general overview of the most notable changes and bug fixes is given below.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n- The ability to apply the **noise normalisation** in each individual iteration of the S+C finder has been implemented. (bee788f8573cc380c01d13d22664a4a86f2fc848)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug-fixes\r\n\r\n- The handling of **2D images** has been improved. (5cf8a5ac608c83cd842db883a73418722aa978c4, 2db5f8636fe58446c6b86ff27a8eb6684e0482a8, 6da3f63ffa0f35fec14ad119060c1d8037e3aaa5)\r\n- An issue with **catalogue-based source finding** has been fixed. (468e0045f3e08201d11d075233815cf0f5f8b5ea)\r\n- SoFiA will no longer crash when trying to **compress** large output files. (967b4a82633c7c3c563804a936c3b32dc12e80be)\r\n- Some issues with **WCS conversion** have been fixed. (64161fb23111aa29d3e3a2b7a22e98005061ff7a, 074dea7bb25bc170c4bf0a5ff7a03ec15fb0e1d5)\r\n- An issue with incompatible **NumPy data types** that resulted in the S+C finder to crash (see issue #159) has been fixed. (a9c3d677072f5260eea60eb908e673fbc0533eb5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- The **precision** of parameters in the output catalogue has been increased. (5ac044e72fba2291b8c4f6b86bd8681c1f1541b2)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\n- A few of the source parameters returned by the **linker** are currently believed to be incorrect for reasons still to be investigated (see issue #125). However, this should not affect the average SoFiA user and would only become an issue if the default parameter space for reliability calculation was changed. We therefore recommend to leave the value of the `reliability.parSpace` parameter at its default for the time being.\r\n- The **CNHI finder** does not appear to be deterministic (see issue #154), and the number of sources detected by the algorithm varies when run repeatedly with the same settings. The cause and impact of this are under investigation.\r\n- **Busy Function** fitting is currently broken (see issue #168). We instead advise to fit the Busy Function to the source spectra produced by SoFiA using stand-alone fitting software such as BusyFit (https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/BusyFit).\r\n- Due to an issue with Python\u2019s zlib compression module, very **large output files** (> a few GB) cannot be automatically compressed at the moment (see issue #139), and **uncompressed** files will instead be written whenever the compression algorithm fails.\r\n"}

It introduces a few new features and comes with a large number of improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nThe most notable new features include the introduction of source **quality flags** that indicate if a source might be truncated for a number of reasons, new control parameters to automatically remove detections at the **linking stage** (e.g. based on a maximum size threshold), and an experimental feature to automatically identify and flag lines of sight that are dominated by **artefacts** such as residual continuum emission.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these new features, several changes have been made to improve the user experience. The most important one of these changes affects the way in which **source bounding boxes** are defined in the catalogue. Originally, SoFiA would define bounding boxes as `[min, max + 1]` which would make it straightforward to use them in Python array slicing commands. However, as this is presumably not what the typical user would na\u00efvely expect, the definition was changed to the more logical `[min, max]`.\r\n\r\n> **Users who have processed bounding boxes in their own scripts in the past will need to update their code to account for the new definition.**\r\n\r\nAnother significant change occurred as a result of our attempts to make **reliability filtering** more robust. Originally, reliability filtering would by default be carried out in `[n_pix, snr_max, snr_sum]` parameter space. However, it turned out that `n_pix` and `snr_sum` were highly correlated, effectively reducing the parameter space from 3-D to 2-D. To reduce the degree of correlation, we have replaced `n_pix` with `snr_mean` which does not strongly correlate with either of the other two parameters. In addition, we no longer apply a fixed flux threshold to discard detections believed to be unreliable due to their low signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, the user can now supply a threshold in `snr_sum / sqrt(n_pix)`, which is a much better proxy of integrated signal-to-noise ratio, to discard low-SNR detections.\r\n\r\nA more general overview of the most notable changes and bug fixes is given below.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n- **Quality flags**: SoFiA now provides a flag that indicates if a source touches the boundaries of the cube, blanked pixels or neighbouring sources.  (67881fb32ec394a1e08ff8fb00194ed7bc3fc79c)\r\n- **Inverted cube**: An option to invert the input data cube was added to facilitate the search for absorption features. (e554505664b15ab32aa81139a748b3d0c74b520b)\r\n- **Source list**: The user can now provide a source list with any input mask to direct SoFiA to only retain certain sources from the input mask and discard all other ones. (18fe69305a15a56822d2dfd0d95862d2341f2252)\r\n- **Memory tracking**: A new option will direct SoFiA to regularly report on its peak memory usage throughout the pipeline run. (18fe69305a15a56822d2dfd0d95862d2341f2252)\r\n- **Flagging of artefacts**: A new experimental feature for automated flagging of artefacts such as residual continuum emission has been added. (9f6bdda977368346f84e0195b61c43f2ddc9384e, fdce62e5e8ffe455ccb9b29cb4ea029e7a8d61f3)\r\n- **New linker options**: The linker now offers additional filtering options to discard detections, e.g. maximum size thresholds. Some of these have been added to the GUI as well. (2c80693199525590f9280c5191e0c69e9490a8c5, 2d692dfc1c9ba3dacc3b5ab83cb9aea73798c802)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug-fixes\r\n\r\n- Improved **mask handling** by fixing a few bugs and implementing additional sanity checks. (21e4a3b046833e6dbae4c9bcea8a5c1f6c42c323)\r\n- A bug in the **source names** generated by SoFiA was fixed whereby the coordinate part of the name was not correctly rounded. (7a3121bed8805a4fb35e243800c0363426225dfd)\r\n- Fixed a bug related to the import of **compressed** FITS files. (83c6d8b35b511cb83059688a9f8610664bec63ba)\r\n- Source **bounding boxes** and other parameters were not correctly updated after mask dilation and parameterisation, causing a few issues. (4ef57895d35e3d09a17828cad1118ab98de5eb2f, 0ed685b9847f87f5151d2028258a97efd9656680)\r\n- Added several sanity checks to ensure that the **reliability** module doesn\u2019t simply crash on faulty user input. (2dfeaa53de5b92999108a20174aaa8b167b51b3d)\r\n- A NumPy compatibility issue with **NumPy 1.10** or higher has been fixed. (bce9ffe4c34d7aacfd1fab03ecb7274bdd7fd326, ed14b0a5d5e08bc77cb99f5b583462e4fac200b3)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- **Mask dilation**: Originally, masks were dilated by a fixed amount along the spectral axis, whereas mask dilation is now based on flux conversion in all three dimensions. (157de7b16cba17e9ebd485a8ad09d370935754f3)\r\n- **Reliability SNR threshold**: Instead of a fixed cut in parameter space, SoFiA now applies a threshold in `snr_sum / sqrt(n_pix)` to filter out sources deemed unreliable due to low SNR. (590699f2870c495966f98fcfb2cbb7d1251ce695, efe3a0e84cbc4ceb45dd651ec28c735e890d8459)\r\n- **Bounding boxes**: Source bounding boxes are now reported as `[min, max]` rather than the original `[min, max + 1]`. The former behaviour was more suitable for use in Python array slicing calls, but the new behaviour is probably what most users would expect. (2c80693199525590f9280c5191e0c69e9490a8c5)\r\n- **Reliability parameter space**: The default of `reliability.parSpace` was changed to replace `n_pix` with `snr_mean` to ensure that the parameters used in calculating reliability are only weakly correlated. (15ff158cfd1852638eab65143391dcafac29369a)\r\n- **Graphical user interface**: The GUI has been continuously updated and provides a lot of additional control parameters and an up-to-date user manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\n- A few of the source parameters returned by the **linker** are currently believed to be incorrect for reasons still to be investigated (see issue #125). However, this should not affect the average SoFiA user and would only become an issue if the default parameter space for reliability calculation was changed. We therefore recommend to leave the value of the `reliability.parSpace` parameter at its default for the time being.\r\n- The **CNHI finder** does not appear to be deterministic, and the number of sources detected by the algorithm varies when run repeatedly with the same settings. The cause and impact of this are under investigation.\r\n- **Busy Function** fitting is currently broken. We instead advise to fit the Busy Function to the source spectra produced by SoFiA using separate fitting software such as BusyFit (https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/BusyFit).\r\n"}

SoFiA now allows users to measure and correct for the local noise variation in a running window across the cube. In addition, all noise measurement algorithms can now be applied to only negative, only positive or all pixels in an attempt to make the noise measurement more robust against outliers (such as sources).\r\n\r\nIn addition to these new features, several changes have resulted in an overall **better performance** of the pipeline in terms of both speed and memory usage. Several temporal spikes in memory usage have been removed, and changes in time-critical algorithms have improved the overall speed of SoFiA, in particular in relation to noise measurement. Our aim is to continue to improve SoFiA\u2019s algorithms to reduce the time and memory footprint of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe most notable changes and bug fixes are listed below.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n- Compression enabled for position-velocity diagrams.

It introduces several new features and comes with a large number of improvements and bug fixes. As SoFiA is now **feature-complete** with respect to the original plan, the major version number has been incremented from 0 to 1.\n\nThe most notable changes include improvements in how source **reliability** is determined, the introduction of several **new source parameters** for extended galaxies, the possibility to write the source catalogue in **SQL format**, and the option to **configure** certain aspects of the graphical user interface. Numerous bug fixes across almost the entire set of SoFiA modules have reduced the frequency of crashes and led to a much more stable pipeline.\n\nPlease note that due to a few changes in parameter names and default values, parameter files created with SoFiA 0.x are no longer compatible with SoFiA 1.x (and vice versa). Attempting to run an older parameter file in SoFiA 1.0.0 may result in the pipeline aborting the source finding run with error messages. In such cases we recommend to create a fresh parameter file from scratch.\n\n### New features\n- Generation of **IAU-compliant source names** (ff938fdefe6f91c32bcf37297fd78d39f9107ab2).\n- Introduction of **GUI configuration options** (cd2511702ce4704ce62c575c8f84169eab8377ed).\n- **Kernel sizes** for the reliability calculation module are now calculated from either the covariance matrix or the variance matrix rather than just the parameter ranges (b5ba49097842447b3bd6a49fe8801142becfa773).\n- Reliability calculation can now be done in a **user-specified parameter space** of arbitrary dimension (865183cea2cd2d5e5ee74162dc3a3417fa5b760b).\n- Calculation of the position angle of the **kinematical major axis** of sources (0140cdad7933e5e4468e9d08a49af6e499363fe0).\n- Fitting of **ellipse** to > 3\u03c3 pixels of source with equal weighting of each pixel (2d17afce7670d8363c5e45a6c13f8180296b02a7).\n- Output catalogue in **SQL format** for insertion into SQL databases (1b58871a5989a956e29fbe3e021e625089aef615).\n\n### Bug-fixes\n- Fixed bug in **mask optimisation** module caused by wrong (old) parameter names (56ba72304a33eafee8b8334cd78dd04cc57f6645).\n- Fixed bug in merging of **XML output catalogues** (4bb1dab23f841770c933b118acb4254a71c078b1).\n- Fixed bug in **moment map** generation (a0ccca222adfca736699fdd2d537699a1823a112).\n- Fixed several issues with **sub-cube** handling (a1ac26d16a4499b820b2b0d176684d14c7ac8f44, d84cf7779e16f967374a00e606fe3e503b12e69a, 3aae9214ea02eded8f1c368d668bf9f60c96267d, 9182804b99babcd1c122cdbafb6925a8e1c731a6, 1fa9a9573794f22d023e172c818c3ec6328f8f09).\n- Fixed an incompatibility issue with the latest versions (\u2265 2.0) of the **GSL** (9339f81f57fae00f02f199c3012c870628aa60a9).\n- Fixed a bug that caused the internal **rms calculation** to crash on noise-free data cubes (2d712370a746be9f924f3e5bb5eec77469cc329b).\n- Fixed a bug in the **WCS** calculation module caused by the speed of light not being defined (d7b62a74b2000703c8c6aab11b6dbba2ec26584e).\n- Fixed a bug that resulted in **output cubelets** to be masked (a0ccca222adfca736699fdd2d537699a1823a112).\n- Fixed a bug that caused the **2D-1D wavelet** filter to work incorrectly (b31e31388fa3a4f88e1b9fd14f574980c443ca45).\n- Fixed a bug that caused the **reliability** calculation to crash when non-existing source parameters were specified (06c8b6b76750300be2fe8cf7cae76e7ab0b6b19f).\n\n### Other changes\n- The SoFiA **version number** is now written to the output catalogue (1ef29ecb5ea157a975dacb763519d8da3d5b0c95).\n- The user can now choose to compile SoFiA **without the GUI** (c29b3beb7f994c1aab2b7b195ad7c5dfc74a59e1).\n- Various updates and improvements of the **linker** module (72891ff0bf31035332c15e4151786442ffb0be61, 72b6d15d0294537d9285bebf3f8f315c1bace278, ff1eb802d1286f21c0ab2f77b92fc27163ce7e51).\n- **Input masks** can now be either the size of the full input data cube or the size of the selected sub-cube (1fa9a9573794f22d023e172c818c3ec6328f8f09).\n"}

It introduces several new features and comes with a large number of improvements and bug fixes. Among the highlights are the implementation of the 2D\u20131D wavelet de-noising algorithm, the CNHI source finder, and the option of optically motivated source finding. In addition, the graphical interface and user manual have been greatly improved and updated, and SoFiA\u2019s memory footprint has been significantly reduced. Note that several of the newly implemented features may not have been fully tested at this stage and could still contain errors.\n\n### New features\n- The **2D\u20131D wavelet de-noising** algorithm of [Fl\u00f6er & Winkel (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASA...29..244F) is now available in SoFiA. Note that this module currently still uses a lot of memory, and further modifications will be needed to improve its performance.\n- The **Characterised Noise HI** (CNHI) source finder by [Jurek (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASA...29..251J) is now available in SoFiA.\n- SoFiA can now be used to do **optically motivated source finding** by searching only small sub-regions around the positions of sources read from a separate catalogue file.\n- An alternative **mask optimisation** method that works by dilating the original source mask is now available.\n- SoFiA now offers to **compress** output data files using gzip.\n- SoFiA can now save a copy of the data cube after application of any input filters.\n\n### Bug fixes\n- The **memory usage** of most modules has been greatly reduced, and most pipeline runs will now require no more memory than about 3 to 4 times the size of the input cube.\n- The handling of **NaN** (used for blanked data) has been improved and corrected in several modules.\n- The **catalogue display** widget was updated to correctly load catalogues files whenever a base name or output directory is specified in SoFiA.\n\n### Other changes\n- **PyFITS** has been replaced with **AstroPy** and is no longer required to install and run SoFiA.\n- The **NumPy** version requirement was changed from \u2265 1.7 to \u2265 1.8.\n- The names of a few **parameters** and **values** have been **changed** to achieve greater consistency. Older parameter files will need to be updated as affected parameters will automatically assume their default values otherwise. See issue #55 for details.\n- The **GUI** has been completely overhauled. To save space on the screen, each module now has its own vertical tab in the GUI. A small icon indicates whether the module in a particular tab has been activated or not. A \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d function in the GUI now provides instant help on individual fields and buttons. In addition, a convenient full-screen mode is now available, and the catalogue display widget now allows the content of selected cells to copied to the clipboard and the sort order of rows to be changed from ascending to descending.\n- The automatic **noise scaling** algorithm can now be applied separately to each of the three cube dimensions.\n- The creation of a **diagnostic plot** by the reliability calculator is now optional (and disabled by default).\n- The **default kernels** for the S+C finder have been changed.\n- At each step, SoFiA reports the **time** that has passed since starting the pipeline.\n- The **user manual** has been updated and expanded significantly.\n"}

It introduces a few features and fixes a number of bugs that were still present in the previous version.\n\n### New features\n- The channel number was added as an additional column in output **spectra** of individual sources.\n- The **noise scaling** module now also allows the option 'negative' to calculate the rms.\n- SoFiA is **Qt 5** ready! When installing SoFiA, the software will automatically detect which version of Qt is installed and compile the source code for the appropriate version of Qt 4 or 5.\n- SoFiA now accepts an additional argument on the command line to immediately **load a parameter file** from disk at start-up.\n- Support for **flagging**: spatial and spectral ranges to be flagged and excluded from the source finding can now be specified.\n- Support for **analytic weights functions** that can be applied to the data before source finding.\n\n### Bug fixes\n- Spectral parameters derived from the **Busy Function** fit were previously calculated relative to a small sub-cube rather than the full cube. This has now been fixed.\n- Several changes have been implemented to reduce the huge **memory footprint** of SoFiA. In future releases we will attempt to reduce that footprint even further.\n- A bug in the GUI that led to the **clip mode** settings for the **threshold finder** being ignored by SoFiA has been fixed.\n- A small fix improves the reading of SoFiA parameter files and now assigns the correct **data type** to all parameters read in.\n- A **security vulnerability** that allowed manipulated SoFiA parameters files to execute arbitrary code has now been fixed.\n- SoFiA now correctly handles **non-standard WCS coordinates** in FITS files created with GIPSY.\n\n### Other changes\n- The S+C finder is now **verbose** by default to allow users to track the progress of the source finding.\n- Plots created by the **reliability calculation** module are now written as PDF files rather than PNG images to reduce the dependence on external libraries.\n- The mask for **merging** neighbouring pixels into sources was changed from a **cuboid** to an **elliptical cylinder** (ellipse in spatial coordinates, constant range in spectral coordinates). A merging radius of 0 will now only merge directly connected pixels (in the spatial domain), but not diagonally connected ones.\n"}

It introduces several new features and fixes a few bugs still present in the previous version.\n\n### New features\n- **WCS support:** Position and frequency/velocity are now converted into proper world coordinates in addition to pixel coordinates. WCS support for further parameters, such as line widths or fluxes, will be implemented in a future release.\n- **PV diagram:** SoFiA now offers to fit an ellipse to the moment-zero map of each source and produce a position-velocity diagram along the morphological major axis during the creation of cubelets.\n- **W\u2098\u2085\u2080 parameter:** SoFiA now includes measurement of the W\u2098\u2085\u2080 line width parameter as defined in [Courtois et al. 2009, AJ, 138, 1938](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....138.1938C). This feature is still untested and will need to used with caution!\n- **Handling of units:** SoFiA now includes the correct units of all source parameters in the output catalogue, both in the ASCII and XML catalogues.\n- **Name of output files:** SoFiA now offers the possibility to specify a base name for all output files that is different from the input file name (the default).\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Handling of **NaN values** ('not a number') has been improved and fixed throughout the code.\n- A bug that resulted in **FITS header entries** not being read correctly on some installations has been fixed. This bug originally resulted in an incorrect number of dimensions of the cube being reported by SoFiA.\n\n### Other changes\n- SoFiA now also requires the [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) package for Python.\n\nPlease see the README file included in the distribution for instructions on how to install and run SoFiA.\n"}
