The plugin doesn't require any configuration. \r\n+ It currently adds to the commit message every song played in the last 10 minutes. This can be changed by editing `(minutes=10)` on line 77 of the Music plugin script. \r\n+ This plugin is restricted by what Rhythmbox changes in its XML-based database.  The most recently played song may not appear in the commit message.\r\n\r\n### New (Mac): Support for Music\r\n+ The Music plugin now supports the Music app that replaces iTunes in newer versions of macOS. [Please see the Wiki](https://github.com/cmdln/flashbake/wiki/Plugins) for installation instructions. Most importantly, the Apple Script now has to be copied over to the root of the Documents folder.\r\n+ Older versions of macOS now have a separate iTunes plugin with a supporting Apple Script. [Please see the Wiki](https://github.com/cmdln/flashbake/wiki/Plugins) for installation instructions. As with the Music for macOS feature, the iTunes Apple Script must be in the root of the Documents folder.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated features\r\n+ **Growl:** No longer supported by Flashbake as the project has been deprecated\r\n+ **Identica:** The social network as we knew it is no longer active\r\n+ **Banshee:** This music player isn't being actively developed. If you still need Banshee support please open an issue in the Flashbake repo on GitHub.\r\n+ **Scrivener:** There wasn't time to add the Scrivener plugin to Flashbake for the initial Python 3 release. There are plans for it to return in the future."}

Per IPIfy's code samples, this solution uses the Requests library, which has been added to setup.py.\r\n\r\nI also commented out some code in __init.py__ that looked like it was a place marker for future development. The problem was this code forced Location.py results to the top of the commit message. Expected behavior is that plugin results end up in the commit message in the order they're placed in the Flashbake config file.\r\n\r\nIssues #33 and #35 should be closed.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ianpaul for contributing these fixes."}
