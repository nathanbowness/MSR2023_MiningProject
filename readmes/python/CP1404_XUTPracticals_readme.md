# Practicals for Python Programming at XUT

This repository contains Python code and instructions for practicals for the XUT delivery of Python Programming, based on CP1404 at James Cook University.

Many files contain `# TODO` comments, which are part of the instructions for what students need to do.  
Complete instructions are found in each prac folder.

## Solutions
Selected practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn by evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical problems. 

**Important**: Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools... _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own coding.

## Practicals are assessed

Assessment will be based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section. You will be marked as follows:

- 4 = Excellent response to all questions (Always aim for this!)
- 3 = Good response to most or all questions, but some omissions or problems
- 2 = Reasonable response to some questions, but some significant omissions or problems
- 1 = Reasonable response to at least one question
- 0 = Minimal or no attempt
- LATE practicals will receive 1 mark for decent work, or 0 marks for poor work. Do not be late.

**Note**: This subject focuses on learning best practices and patterns for solving problems using programming in Python, and it is important that you learn these foundations according to the teaching philosophy of the subject. For this reason (to help you learn properly!), you will not achieve full marks for working/complete practicals unless they are done in the way that we teach. Here are some reasons that you might lose marks for your practicals (and assignments):

- Your work looks too similar to any provided solutions
- Your work includes concepts and code not taught in the subject
- You miss or skip part of a question (you must attempt all requirements for all questions)
- Your work does not follow the core concepts and patterns (e.g., using global variables, while True loops or similar techniques), even if they work!

## Structure
Each practical is usually structured in multiple parts:

-   **Part 1** is usually a walkthrough or a warm-up that should not take
    long but shows you working code (which you can reference and learn
    from),

-   **Part 2** is usually a "fill-in-the-blanks" where you must do a small
    task, mostly modifying existing code,

-   and **Part 3** is usually a "do-from-scratch" exercise where you do the
    whole task with the benefit of having completed the earlier parts.

-   The **practice/extension** section provides further challenges for you
    to practise and extend your programming skills. (You do not need to
    complete these sections for your prac marks.)

**Important:** You should not expect to learn and do well in this
subject if you only do the minimum contact hours (like just these pracs).  
You need to be practising and revising your programming skills regularly multiple
times every week. You can find even more practice projects at
