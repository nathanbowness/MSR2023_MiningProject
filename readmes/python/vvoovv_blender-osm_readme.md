* Options to use custom tileable building textures (e.g. from textures.com)
* Satellite imagery and web maps projected on a terrain

* **blender-osm** imports buildings from OpenStreetMap _without_ any texture applied. Building height and number of floors are used to create the final scene. Composition into 3D parts for a building with the complex structure is also processed. A large number of roof shapes is supported. If a terrain is provided, buildings are placed on the terrain automatically.
* **blender-osm** downloads and imports real world terrain data with resolution about 30 meter.
* **blender-osm** can import GPX-tracks and project them on the terrain.
* River, lakes, forests, vegetation are imported as polygons. If a terrain is provided, they are projected on the terrain.
* Imported roads, paths and railways have width. They are represented by Blender curves with a profile object. If a terrain is provided, roads are projected on the terrain.

Get the addon at [gumroad.com](https://prochitecture.gumroad.com/l/blender-osm)! You might prefer to pay some price for the addon to support its development. However it is completely optional. The addon source code is available under GPL license!
