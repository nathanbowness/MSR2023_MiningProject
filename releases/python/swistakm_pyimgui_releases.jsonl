This minor release consists mainly of small features, bug fixes, and adjustments that could be squeezed in for those who won't be able to easily go to 2.0.\r\n\r\nBuild pipeline did go fully on AppVeyor using `Cibuildwheel 2.1.3`. This should ensure support for Python 3.6 to 3.9 on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. This implies the dropping of Python version 2.7 to 2.4 as announced in the previous minor release, but also 3.5. The current minor release has been built manually for all previously supported versions to be consistent with the made announcement. Python version support dropping will be effective for the next major release.\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, the project management team has changed a bit. Due to personal reasons, our dear @swistakm, creator and previous maintainer of the project, has been obliged to distance himself from the project. We are deeply grateful for what he started.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this transition, the repository has been changed from @swistakm personal one to the @pyimgui/dev organization one. If you wish to help with the development and management of this project, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @learn-more who helped me to take on this project and moderated the list of issues.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pyimgui/pyimgui/releases/52405967/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 5}

Big thanks to @KinoxKlark for taking up this challenge!\r\n\r\nRecent progress was sluggish mostly due to inefficient build pipelines. Building multi-platform extensions as binary wheels isn't easy. Preparing new artifacts for a minor release took often multiple days spent on fighting with issues on two different CI providers. Also free offering for OSS projects doesn't offer fast parallel builds. I simply could't afford spending so much of my personal time on doing this.\r\n\r\nWe'll be converging on Appveyor platform because it has way better support for multi-platform builds and their macOS image actually supports newer Python release. Unfortunately due to that change we are unable to provide Python3.3 wheels for macOS in ordinary release process. That's why this version will not have such a wheel. Anyway, September 2017 was the end of life for that release so I hope no body will miss it. \r\n\r\nFor next minor and patch releases we will be supporting some of other Python EOL releases but we will drop them in next major release (see Announcement section). We could support it for longer but it really makes pipelines more brittle and complex."}
