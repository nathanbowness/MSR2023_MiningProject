For instance, in the code below, `x`, `y`, `z` will be in\r\nmeters\r\n```\r\nx, y, z = ts.get_particle(['x', 'y', 'z'], iteration=1000)\r\n```\r\n- In `ts.get_field`, slicing can now be done in several directions, and for\r\n1d, 2d, 3d, and circ geometries. As a consequence, this breaks backward\r\ncompatibility for 3d field:\r\n```get_field(field=field, coord=coord, iteration=iteration)```\r\nused to return the central slice along `y` while it now returns the full 3d field.\r\nIn addition, the name of the argument of `get_field` that triggers slicing\r\nhas been changed from `slicing_dir` to `slice_across` (and `slicing` has been\r\nchanged to `slice_relative_position`).\r\n- `openPMD-viewer` does not rely on Cython anymore. Instead, it uses `numba`\r\nfor functions that perform a substantial amount of computation.\r\n- A new function (`ts.iterate`) was introduced in order to quickly apply a\r\ngiven function to all iterations of a time series. See the docstring of\r\n`ts.iterate` for more information.\r\n- The function `get_laser_envelope` does not support the argument `index` anymore\r\n(which was effectively used in order to perform slicing). Instead, users should use\r\nthe argument `slicing_dir`. In addition, `get_laser_envelope` now supports the\r\nargument `plot_range`.\r\n- The function `get_laser_waist` does not support the agument `slicing_dir` anymore.\r\n\r\n"}

Here are the main changes:\n- Support for the deprecated widget package `IPython.html` has been dropped. From now on, users need to install the widget package `ipywidgets`, for the GUI to work.\n- The initialization of an `OpenPMDTimeSeries` object can now be made faster by setting the optional argument `check_all_files` to `False`.\n- The data reader can now support `macroWeighted` quantities. As consequence, output files from [PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu) can now be correctly read.\n- The package does not assume anymore that all species contain the same particle quantities. For instance, the package will support a file that contains the positions of ions, and the positions, momenta and weighting of electrons. As part of this, the attribute `OpenPMDTimeSeries.avail_ptcl_quantities` has been replaced by a dictionary `OpenPMDTimeSeries.avail_record_components`.\n- This release introduces automatic PEP8 verification as part of the automatic tests that are run on Travis CI (see CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- The evaluation of the waist and duration of the laser is now based on Gaussian fit of the transverse and longtudinal profile respectively.\n"}
