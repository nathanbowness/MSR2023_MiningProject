In addition to these,\r\nsignificant work has been done to dramatically improve performance and reduce\r\nresource consumption on very highly parallel pipelines with large numbers of \r\ninput / output files.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n   - Preliminary support for executing pipelines on Google Cloud Services\r\n     (Compute Engine) and mounting storage for pipelines from Google Cloud \r\n     Storage\r\n\r\n   - Preliminary support for executing pipelines on Amazon Web Services \r\n     using EC2 and mounting storage for pipelines from S3\r\n\r\n   - The 'groovy' command can now run embedded groovy (executed outside\r\n     Bpipe) using the groovy runtime bundled with Bpipe\r\n\r\n   - Support aliasing to string values in addition to outputs \r\n    \r\n   - Experimental support for beforeRun hook in command config: execute\r\n     arbitrary groovy code before a command executes\r\n\r\n   - Many performance improvements, esp. for large, highly\r\n     parallel pipelines\r\n     \r\n   - Support configuration for number of retries for status\r\n     polling of HPC jobs (statusPollRetries setting)\r\n     \r\n   - Support for 'optional' inputs in pipelines: to make input optional, \r\n     suffix with 'optional'. Also can add 'flag' to add flags \r\n     in commands eg: ${input.csv.optional.flag('--csv')}\r\n\r\n   - New operator: merge point operator (>>>) automatically configures a stage\r\n     to merge outputs from a previous parallel split\r\n\r\n   - Add region.bedFlag(flag) method for convenience when passing \r\n     regions to commands \r\n\r\n   - 'var' expressions may now be added in the main pipeline script,\r\n      not just pipeline stages. These define optional\r\n      variables, and provide a default.\r\n     \r\n   - JMS support now responds to 'ping' message with 'pong' reply\r\n     if JMS 'Reply-To' is set to allow for status monitoring\r\n     \r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n   - Fix incorrect \"abnormal termination\" messages\r\n     printed to console when pipeline stopped with 'bpipe stop'\r\n\r\n   - Fix incorrect 'pre-existing' printed for outputs that were \r\n     created by pipeline\r\n\r\n   - Fix genome not accessible in pipeline the first time downloaded, \r\n     printing error\r\n\r\n   - Re-execute checks if a commmand in the same stage has executed \r\n    \r\n   - synchronize initialization of dir watcher to fix sporadic \r\n     ConcurrentModificationExceptions \r\n    \r\n   - Fix empty embedded parallel stage list causing resolution of incorrect\r\n     downstream input \r\n    \r\n   - Fix leak of 'var' variables across branches when 'using' applied to \r\n     pipeline stage \r\n\r\n   - Fix error if 4 or more arguments passed to \"to\" in transform \r\n\r\n   - Fix bpipe complaining spurious outputs not created on retry,\r\n     but not original run \r\n     \r\n   - Fix some bugs where branch names were not being observed \r\n     \r\n   - Fix branch name sometimes inserted without separating period for transforms \r\n    \r\n   - Avoid redundantly putting branch name into files \r\n\r\n   - Improved detail in error / log messages in a few places \r\n     \r\n   - Fix missing branch and '..' in filenames \r\n     \r\n   - Change: globally defined variables must now be held constant\r\n     once pipeline starts \r\n     \r\n   - Fix split regions not stable between runs, set region id as branch\r\n     name \r\n     \r\n   - Fix bed.split producing different splits if run repeatedly on same bed \r\n     \r\n   - Fix errors output if SLF4J referenced in user loaded libraries\r\n     \r\n   - Fix npe / improve error message when filter used with mismatching output ext \r\n     \r\n   - Fix error in stage body resulting in confusing 'no associated storage'\r\n     assertion failure \r\n\r\n   - Add 'allowForeign' option to 'from' to let it process non-outputs \r\n     \r\n   - Lessen the retries and retry interval when file cannot be cleaned\r\n     up "}

Fix: a `send` command encountered during `bpipe test` would not send the\r\n   message but would record it as sent so that it would not be sent if\r\n   the pipeline is then subsequently executed.\r\n\r\n - Fix: various issues with `bpipe stats` printing bad dates / times\r\n\r\n - you can now run `bpipe stats` while a pipeline is runnign to get realtime\r\n   info\r\n\r\n - The bpipe agent now supports a `ping` command that will respond to confirm\r\n   the agent is alive (via ActiveMQ).\r\n\r\n - You can now set parameters (variables) from within `bpipe.config` via\r\n   a `parameters` section. This sets variables the same as if you set them \r\n   via `-p name=value` when running bpipe.\r\n\r\n - You can now set pipeline limits (memory,concurrency,etc) from a `config` section \r\n   within a pipeline script\r\n\r\n - Bpipe now supports gitlab through its `send` functionality. Issues can be created\r\n   or updated added with syntax like: `send issue(title: ...., assignee: ...) to gitlab`\r\n"}

To achieve this, Bpipe now depends\non new Java APIs available in Java 1.7. This means that\nBpipe now requires Java 1.7 and will not work any longer\nwith Java 1.6.\n\nAdditionally, a range of small bugs have been fixed and \nsmaller features added. \n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\nOf note, there is one change that can\naffect backwards compatibility. This relates to use of the \n'transform' construct when multiple files of the same type are\ntransformed to multiple files of a different type. In the past\nyou could write a single transform such as:\n\n```\ntransform('.txt') to('.csv') {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nPreviously this would transform every text file in the inputs\nto a corresponding CSV file as output. From 0.9.9.2 forward\nthis will only transform a single input file. For multiple files, the\ntransform must now be specified as:\n\n```\ntransform('*.txt') to('.csv') {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis change has been made to resolve ambiguity, since there was no \nway previously to specify that a stage transforms exactly 1 input file\nof a given type.\n\n## Change list\n- Large scale refactoring for performance with\n   large numbers of inputs / outputs.\n   Bpipe now requires Java 1.7!\n- Issue #180: bpipe doesn't allow empty branch list \n- Issue #184: chr not passed to nested parallel pipeline \n- fix wrong output referenced for 2nd double ext in\n   produce eg: $output.bar.txt \n- support for modules in TorqueCommandExecutor \n- fix potential failure to cleanup files on error \n- Issue #175: Check state can be confused b/w branches \n- Handle errors in log init so that log fail doesn't prevent\n   ability to run Bpipe (java logging tries to obtain exclusive \n   locks which aren't supported on some file systems. \n- Update to groovy 2.4.6 (helps performance)\n- Fix ambiguous behavior of transform() when multiple inputs\n   match transform pattern. New behavior requires transform('*.ext') to\n   match upstream multiple files ending with .ext (minor possibilty for \n   backwards incompatibility)\n- Fix output resolved as input for produce+double ext + numbered input \n- Fix exception  when check saved without pass/fail set \n- Fix leak of tail / sed processes under OSX in some\n   situations\n- Fix bootstrap theme for docs not recognised \n- Support to open a debugger Groovy console at any point \n   in a pipeline using debug() function\n- Add settings.gradle to stop build failing if\n   checked out to directory other than 'bpipe' \n- Fix possible hang when multi command used inside\n   produce(...) \n- support for \"mem_param\" for torque executor\n   this allows to choose which parameter Bpipe should use\n   between \"mem\", \"pvmem\", etc.  by setting mem_param=\"mem\"\n   in a command config \n- Issue #176: support multiple commands per config in multi \n- Various documentation fixes and cleanups\n- fix double file extension on input not resolving second and\n   later input (eg: when referenced in form $input2.foo.bar)\n"}

Update saved command info after cleanup.  \n- ensure stop time is always set for commands \n- close possible file handle leak in (undocumented) capture command\n- fix: more robust checking for file existence on distributed file systems which \n   may exhibit delays before files become visible locally\n- Avoid misleading termination message when user deliberately stops \n   pipeline \n- Incorrect input used as basis for output file name in transforms inside \n   'from', if competing input available from previous stage\n- fix: rare deadlocks - use dedicated thread pool per pipeline tier to \n   avoid possibility of deadlocks in heavily nested pipelines\n"}

Loads into the \n   context of current branch rather than global. Pipeline stages \n   not supported, only variables.\n- prevent error if files used by Bpipe are not writable but\n   are deletable \n- prevent premature wildcard expansion of\n   quoted arguments passed to Bpipe    \n- support for cleanup as command in pipeline stage \n- prevent error if files used by Bpipe are not writable but \n   are deletable \n- attempt to ensure log messages written\n   even if exit due to outofmemory error \n- log message if file is not cleaned up because it doesn't\n   exist: help to diagnose problems with files not cleaned up \n- better log info about where config files are \n- allow memory to be integer for torque/slurm/etc, fix error\n   querying status in torque/slurm/etc, include queuing system\n   command id in bpipe status output \n- show pending and waiting jobs with bpipe status, don't throw ugly error \n   if no commands ever run \n- Fix: downstream references to inputs\n   by index throwing \"expected more inputs\" error incorrectly \n- avoid confusing stack overflow when user defines branch\n   variable with same name as pipeline stage \n- accept 'MB' or 'GB' in command line option for memory,\n   cache runtime directory instead of creating new File objects\n   all the time to figure it out \n- prevent null pointer exception when list containing null \n   provided to 'from' \n- fix multiple inputs not\n   forwarding correctly when referenced using \"$inputs\" \n- Bug fixes for lsf, added walltime option for Lsf \n- caching of dependency lookups by \n   canonical path to speed up large, complex pipelines \n- caching of canonical path with check of basePath to ensure\n   consistency \n- fix dependency issues after\n   cleanup when non-default output directory used \n- Performance optimisations for systems where canonicalPath is\n   very slow, better logging to resolve dependency issues \n"}

============\n- fix: errors may printed about files not existing when attempting \n   to move to trash\n- fix bpipe jobs not printing jobs after user ctrl-c's out of \n   run command\n- fix incorrect default for procs_mode variable for torque \n- fix ugly stack trace error when transform called without arguments \n- fix failing to escape trailing . in split patterns \n- branch.dir now ha a default value so that it is easier to put in reusable\n   pipeline stages \n- Ensure walltime gets interpreted as\n   integer even if passed as String / BigDecimal / Long etc \n- fix trash option not working in bpipe cleanup \n- Fix default output directory not applied to second\n   produce argument if first specifies a directory \n- fix produce() with reference only to output.dir causing\n   retry test to incorrectly indicate commands would run again\n- Fix incorrect file reported for errors when multiple\n   external files loaded, added some comments, removed hard\n   tabs \n- fix branch variable not overriding default value of\n   variable specified with var \n- Fix files not checked after 'produce' if previously output and then \n   removed outside of bpipe \n- Fix files not checked after 'produce' if\n   previously output and then removed outside of bpipe \n- fix 'inputs' variable with double file extension not always resolving\n   only files matching both extensions     \n- fix output() function causing spurious errors about incompatible inputs \n   when combined with output variable extensions \n- fix command not running when explicitly specified by produce() if another\n   implicit output referenced by command \n- Support for produce using wildcard based on regex (via ~) \n- Add information about total run time to report and command log \n- support to specify branch filter on command line, to limit\n   running to a specific branch (for testing, usually) \n- fix explicit output() combined with produce(...) resulting in\n   inconsistent behavior \n- Fix stack traces printed out when errors occur to use actual name of user \n   scripts instead of groovy generated ones \n- fix build.gradle not working with existing gradle wrapper \n- Implement default behavior for transform with\n   more to() values than from() values instead of failing \n- Fix output referenced inside check causing check to be\n   skipped / behave incorrectly\n"}
