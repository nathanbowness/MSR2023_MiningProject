# JDEE

The JDEE is an add-on software package that turns Emacs into a
comprehensive system for creating, editing, debugging, and documenting
Java applications.

## About the project

As of 2015-07-13, https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/ is the primary source repository.

See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for migration instructions.

Additional information can be found at http://jdee.sourceforge.net/rootpage.html and at https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/wiki

## Requirements

Emacs 24.4 is the oldest version that JDEE can be expected to run in.

If you install JDEE through the Emacs package system, it will take
care of installing the prerequisites for you:
* flycheck
* memoize
* dash
These packages can be found on ELPA and/or MELPA.

JDEE also requires [JDEE Server](http://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee-server) for some operations.

## Installing with the Emacs package system

The project is available in MELPA. To install it do the following:
1. Add MELPA to your `.emacs` or `init.el` if you don't have it:
```emacs-lisp
;;; Add this at the top of the init.el file:
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(when (< emacs-major-version 24)
  ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
(package-initialize)
```
2. Install JDEE from Emacs using its package manager:
```
M-x list-packages
```
There select JDEE and install: i x

3. Install [JDEE Server](http://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee-server) from github

Follow short readme at [JDEE Server](http://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee-server).

4. Customize `jdee-server-dir` to make it point to directory with JDEE Server jars.

_Warning!_ Don't install JDEE Server inside JDEE installed from MELPA (`~/.emacs.d/elpa/jdee-xxx`), because it will be deleted with next update of JDEE! Create a separate directory, for example: `~/.emacs.d/jdee-server`.

Customized `jdee-server-dir` in your init file should look something like:
```emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables
 '(jdee-server-dir "/Users/you/.emacs.d/jdee-server"))
```

For additional information, see the [old installation instructions](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/peterwvj/jdee/blob/master/doc/flat/install.html).

## Installing from source (for JDEE devs only)

1. Clone [the github repository](https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/).
2. Open the cloned JDEE directory in dired.
3. Being in dired, install using command: ```package-install-from-buffer```

For development you will need to install Cask:

1. Install [Cask](http://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

2. Run ```cask install``` from the JDEE directory (make sure that the
   ```cask``` command is in your PATH).

3. Run the tests: ```make test```

To use this built distribution without installation, in your .emacs add:

```emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/jdee")
  (require 'jdee)
```

## Building the documentation in other formats
JDEE ships with documentation in Info format, but if you want you can generate the docs in other formats too.

To generate Info, HTML and PDF documentation:

- Install texinfo.

- For PDF generation, you also need texi2dvi, texinfo-tex, texlive-ec
  and texlive-cm-super.

- In the doc/ subdirectory, run: ```makeinfo --info --html --pdf jdee.texi```

## Features

Some of the features of JDEE include:

- source code editing with syntax highlighting, auto indentation using the
  native GNU Emacs Java mode
- Symbol completion (jdee-complete-in-line)
- Code generation: templates, import insertion/deletion/ordering
  etc.
- browse JDK doc, using the browser of your choice (jdee-help-symbol and
  jdee-help-docsets)
- browse your source code (jdee-find-class* and semantic integration)
- compilation with automatic jump from error messages to responsible line in the
  source code using ant (jdee-ant-build).
- run Java application in an interactive (comint) Emacs buffer
- integrated debugging with interactive debug command buffer and automatic
  display of current source file/line when stepping through code (jdee-debug)
- supports Oracle/OpenJDK Java 7
- runs on any platform supported by GNU Emacs 24.3 and later
- easily and infinitely customizable

### [Known Issues](https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/issues)

- Static imports don't quite work
- Limited support for Java template beyond basic highlighting, parsing, and
  indenting.
- Indentation after multi-line annotations might be unexpected
