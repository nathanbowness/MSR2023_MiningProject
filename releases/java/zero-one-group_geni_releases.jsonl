The idea is that the `core` namespaces should refer to only Spark SQL and the `ml` namespaces refer to Spark ML. This will help the mapping of Geni functions to the original Spark functions.\r\n- Added a simple benchmark piece that compares the performance of Pandas vs. Geni on a particular problem.\r\n- An asciinema screencast for the downloading the uberjar and interacting with the Geni REPL."}

Download the uberjar, and simply try out the REPL with `java -jar geni-repl-uberjar-0.0.21.jar`! An nREPL server is automatically started with an `.nrepl-port` file, so that common Clojure text editors should be able to jack in automatically.\r\n\r\nThe initial namespace automatically requires:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(require '[zero-one.geni.core :as g]\r\n         '[zero-one.geni.ml :as ml])\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that functions such as `g/read-csv!` and `ml/logistic-regression` are immediately available.\r\n\r\nThe Spark session is available as a Clojure Future object, which can be dereferenced with `@spark`. To see the full default spark config, invoke `(g/spark-conf @spark)`!"}
