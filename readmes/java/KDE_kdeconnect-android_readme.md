# KDE Connect - Android app

KDE Connect is a multi-platform app that allows your devices to communicate (eg: your phone and your computer).

## (Some) Features
- **Shared clipboard**: copy and paste between your phone and your computer (or any other device).
- **Notification sync**: Read and reply to your Android notifications from the desktop.
- **Share files and URLs** instantly from one device to another.
- **Multimedia remote control**: Use your phone as a remote for Linux media players.
- **Virtual touchpad**: Use your phone screen as your computer's touchpad and keyboard.

All this without wires, over the already existing WiFi network, and using TLS encryption.
