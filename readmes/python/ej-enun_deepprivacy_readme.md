# DeepPrivacy


![](images/example.gif)

DeepPrivacy is a fully automatic anonymization technique for images.

This repository contains the source code for the paper [*"DeepPrivacy: A Generative Adversarial Network for Face Anonymization"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04538) published at ISVC 2019, and Â [*"Image Inpainting with Learnable Feature Imputation
"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01077) published at GCPR 2020.

The DeepPrivacy GAN never sees any privacy sensitive information, ensuring a fully anonymized image. 
It utilizes bounding box annotation to identify the privacy-sensitive area, and sparse pose information to guide the network in difficult scenarios.

DeepPrivacy detects faces with state-of-the-art detection methods.
[Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) is used to generate a sparse pose information of the face, and [DSFD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10220) is used to detect faces in the image.

## Information
Check out the original version here:

Check out [GCPR readme](GCPR.md) to reproduce our results from our publication "Image Inpainting with Learnable Feature Imputation".


## New features in version 2
- FP16 inference
- Support for face detection and landmark detection with a single SSD model (retinanet).
- Face alignment before anonymization - improves performance for rotate faces.
- Heavily refactored code.
- All improvements from our paper "Image Inpainting with Learnable Feature Imputation" are included.
- Support for standard image inpainting datasets (CelebA-HQ and Places2).
- Support for video inference


## Installation
Install the following: 
- Pytorch  >= 1.7.0 (Some checkpoints requires a bug fix from pytorch 1.7 - the current master branch)
- Torchvision >= 0.6.0
- NVIDIA Apex (If you want to train any models - nolt needed for inference)
- Python >= 3.6

Simply by running our `setup.py` file:

```
python3 setup.py install
```
or with pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/hukkelas/DeepPrivacy/
```

#### Docker
In our experiments, we use docker as the virtual environment. 

Our docker image can be built by running:
```bash
cd docker/

docker build -t deep_privacy . 
```

## Usage

We have a file command line interface to anonymize images.
```
python3 anonymize.py --source_path input_image.png --target_path output_path.png
```
You can change the model with the "-m" or "--model" flag (see model zoo).
The cli accepts image files, video files, and directories.

The cli is also available outside the folder `python -m deep_privacy.cli`.

Also check out `python -m deep_privacy.cli -h ` for more arguments.


### Webcam
Test out the model with
```
python webcam.py
```
Also check out `python webcam.py -h ` for more arguments.

### Retinanet Detector
Combined keypoint and face detection in one single-shot model (SSD-based).
Uses five landmarks: eyes, nose, and mouth (left and right).
Model is based on [RetinaFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641).
The model is significantly faster, but has poorer detection than DSFD.

### DSFD + RCNN
Uses [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) is for keypoint detection, and [DSFD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10220) for face detection.
