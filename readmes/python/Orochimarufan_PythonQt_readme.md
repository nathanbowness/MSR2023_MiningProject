PythonQt

This is a fork of http://pythonqt.sourceforge.net

Summary
-------

PythonQt is a library to embed Python in Qt applications and
extend their functionality through Python scripts.

The core library uses Qt's QMetaObject system to
convert data between Qt/C++ and Python.

The QtAll extension provides wrappers of most Qt classes
to be used in Python, similar to PyQt and PySide.
