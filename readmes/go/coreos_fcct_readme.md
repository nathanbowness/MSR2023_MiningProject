# Butane

Butane (formerly the Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler, FCCT) translates human readable Butane Configs
into machine readable [Ignition](https://github.com/coreos/ignition) Configs. See the [getting
started](docs/getting-started.md) guide for how to use Butane and the [configuration
specifications](docs/specs.md) for everything Butane configs support.

For information on developing Butane, using it as a library, or understanding how the binaries released
in this repository are built, see the [development docs](docs/development.md).
