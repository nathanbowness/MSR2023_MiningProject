This is built on top of mangos v1, but includes a number of breaking changes.\r\n\r\n* The `compat` package is gone.\r\n\r\n* A new `OpenContext` and support API for building concurrent applications is available for req, rep, surveyor, respondent, and sub protocols.\r\n\r\n* Dialing is \"synchronous\" by default now (so if a peer is down at first, the caller will get a chance to notice.) . This is tunable by the `OptionDialAsynch` socket option for dialers.\r\n\r\n* The old `Port` API has been completely revamped with a better `Pipe` API, which includes notifications before and after the pipe has been attached to the socket (and also detached from the socket).\r\n\r\n* Significant performance improvements have been made.\r\n\r\n* The REQ/REP pattern is much more responsive to the case where a peer drops while a request is outstanding.\r\n\r\n* It is now sufficient to just import a transport packet, the old method of explicitly adding a transport is gone.\r\n\r\n* The underlying API for transport and protocol implementations has undergone quite a lot of change.  These APIs are still not really stable, so and may change further.  (We consider these APIs \"internal\" for now.)"}
