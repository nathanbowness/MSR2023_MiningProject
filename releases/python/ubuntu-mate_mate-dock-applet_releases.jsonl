This is useful when the dock has limited space on its panel and will prevent it from expanding over other applets. To scroll app icons, the mouse pointer must be moved over either the first or last icon in the dock. If scrolling is possible in that direction, the app icon will darken and an arrow will be displayed over it.\r\n\r\n![scroll arrow](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/0.81%20scroll%20up.png)\r\n\r\nIf the mouse pointer hovers over an icon in this state, the dock will scroll in the indicated direction. \r\nAs with icons, the arrows are drawn using the current icon theme and their appearance will therefore vary from theme to theme.\r\n\r\nApp scrolling is automatically configured and enabled when using the Mutiny layout from Mate Tweak. When using any other layout scrolling can be enabled using a new preferences setting.\r\n\r\n![scrolling preferences](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/0.81%20scrolling%20prefs.png)\r\n\r\nIf 'Variable' is selected, scrolling is disabled and the dock will behave as in take as much space on the panel as it needs, possibly expanding over other applets as in previous versions. If 'Fixed' is selected, the dock will claim enough space to display the specfied number of app icons, and will begin scrolling icons when it contains more than this number.\r\n\r\nA few things to note about scrolling:\r\n* The implementation is still in an early state and bugs can be expected...\r\n* It is Gtk3 only\r\n* The current approach of setting scrolling on or off via a preferences item is a short term workaround while [this](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/727) issue with the MATE panel and python introspection is fixed. Once done, future versions of the applet will be able to automatically enable and disable app scrolling as and when needed.\r\n\r\nThe other big change for this version is that applet the no longer uses its own method of matching applications and instead uses the [bamf](https://launchpad.net/bamf) library for this. What this means for users is that from now on the applet will be a lot better at matching applications and windows to their dock icons. For package maintainers it means the applet has the following new dependencies: bamfdaemon, libbamf and gir1.2-bamf \r\n \r\nThere are also two minor changes to mentions. Firstly, popup windows (action lists and window lists) no longer steal focus from other windows. Secondly, when using a solid fill for the active icon background, the contrast between the icon and the background has been improved.\r\n\r\nFinally, a screenshot of V0.81 applet on Ubuntu Mate 18.04. Note that the dock is just about to scroll.\r\n\r\n![V0.81 Mutiny 18.04](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/0.81%20Mutiny.png)\r\n"}

Once done, these settings will of course be retained. Also note the tip on the dialog box: when pinning apps to specific workspaces it can also be useful to make sure that unpinned apps from other workspaces are not displayed in the dock, and that indicators/window list items from other workspaces are also not displayed.\r\n\r\n### Unpinning apps\r\n\r\nUnpinning an app now displays a notification e.g.:\r\n\r\n![unpinning notification](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/unpin_notify.png)\r\n\r\nIf the Undo button is clicked, the app is re-pinned and placed back in the dock at its previous position.\r\n\r\n### Progress bars \r\n\r\nOld progress bars were a bit scruffy looking: \r\n\r\n![old progress bars](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/old_pb.png)\r\n\r\nbut have now been tidied up a bit:\r\n\r\n![new progress bars](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/new_pb.png)\r\n\r\n"}

This is for GTK3 versions of the applet only.\r\n\r\n### Dragging and dropping data between running applications\r\nIf data is dragged from an application onto another running application's dock icon, the new application will be made active allowing the dragged data to dropped onto it. This can be especially useful on small screens or single monitor setups. However, this is also for GTK3 only.\r\n\r\n###  Keyboard shortcuts can now be used to activate and select applications in the dock.\r\nThe shortcuts are:\r\n\r\n* &lt;Super&gt; 1 - 0 for the first 10 applications in the dock\r\n* &lt;Super&gt;&lt;Alt&gt; 1 - 0 for applications 10-20 in the dock\r\n\r\nFor example, to activate the 5th application, it would be necessary to hold down the Super key          (i.e. the Windows) key and press 5. For the 12th application, it would be necessary to hold down both the Super key and the Alt key and press 2.\r\n\r\nWhen these shortcuts are used, the effect is as follows:\r\n  * If the app is not running, it will be started.\r\n  * If the app is running and only has a single window open, the window will cycled between minimised and activated states.\r\n  * If the app is running and has multiple windows open, each use of the shortcut will activate and display each window in turn.\r\n\r\n### Minor changes\r\nIn addition to these new features the following changes have also been made to the applet:\r\n* The Hints and Tips section of the About dialog has been updated with information regarding the new drag and drop and shortcut features.\r\n* A bug has been fixed which would have prevented action and window lists from appearing\r\n\r\n### New Dependency\r\nFinally, package maintainers need to note a new dependency of the applet - Keybinder. For example, on Arch Linux this is the libkeybinder-3.0 package, on Ubuntu 16.04 it is gir1.2-keybinder-0.0 and on Ubtuntu 16.10, gir1.2-keybinder-3.0\r\n"}

In previous versions of the applet, an icon would pulse only once.\n\n## New indicator and active icon background types\n\nThe applet has a new indicator type, a single solid bar, and a new active icon background type where the background is filled with a colour based on the app's icon. See below:\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/Bar%20ind%20and%20solid%20fill%20icon%20bg.png)\n\nThe preferences dialog has been updated to allow the user to choose which types of indicator and icon background to use, and displays a live preview:\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/New%20indicator%20and%20icon%20bg%20prefs%201.png)\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/New%20indicator%20and%20icon%20bg%20prefs%202.png)\n\nWhen using Gtk3 versions of MATE, the bar indicator will be drawn using the highlight colour defined by the current Gtk3 theme. In the screenshots above the Arc Darker theme was used, hence the the blue bars. The screenshot below shows the Ambiant-Mate theme in use, along with appropriately green indicators.\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/Bar%20indicators%20and%20Ambient-mate.png)\n\nFor technical reasons it isn't possible to read the current theme's highlight colour on Gtk2 versions of MATE. Therefore bar indicators will be drawn in grey. Since this colour won't fit in well with many themes, a new preference option has been added which allows the colour of bar indicators to be specified. This can be found on the 'Misc' tab of the Preferences dialog.\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/Fallback%20bar%20ind%20colour.png)\n\nClicking on the colour button will display the standard Gtk colour selection dialog, from which a new bar colour can be chosen.\n\nTo accomplish all this, the code which relates to drawing dock items has been reworked. This will allow new types of indicator and active icon backgrounds to be more easily added in future.\n\n## About dialog\n\nThis now looks a bit nicer, and displays license and hints and tips info.\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/dock%20about%200.76%201.png)\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/dock%20about%200.76%202.png)\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/dock%20about%200.76%203.png)\n"}

The effect of clicking an app's icon now depends on whether or not the app is running and how many windows it has open.\n- If the app is not running, clicking its icon will start it\n- If the app is running and has only a single window open, the window will be activated\n- If the app is running and has more than one window open, the window list will be displayed (it can be dismissed by selecting a window, moving the mouse away from the applet and window list, or clicking the app's icon again)\n\nAs previously, shift-clicking a running app's icon will start a new instance of the app (not all apps support  multiple instances however...)\n\n### Window lists\n\nOn MATE Gtk3, window lists and action list windows will now use colours from the Gtk theme and should match the panel:\n\n![win list colours](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10033637/18865053/2635a646-8491-11e6-90f3-27e5aa80b117.png)\n\nOn both Gtk2 and Gtk3, when a custom panel colour is set, window lists and action lists will use this colour for their background, and choose a suitable foreground colour to ensure that text is legible.\n\n### Integration with Compiz\n\nA new configuration option has been added which allows the user to select whether to use the applet's built in window list for selecting windows, or to use Compiz:\n\n![win selection option](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10033637/18865077/549cd680-8491-11e6-827d-c9c1e09d6fb0.png)\n\nFor the Compiz option, note:\n- Compiz must be being used as the window manager. This is easy to achieve with MATE Tweak.\n- The Compiz Scale and DBus Plugins must be activated in Compiz Config Settings Manager. See below\n\n![ccsm scale](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10033637/18865297/68a65150-8492-11e6-84d7-48c8a52e069d.png)\n\n![ccsm dbus](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10033637/18865300/72580554-8492-11e6-9b9a-4c2ee4192a0f.png)\n\nWhen an app has more than one window open, clicking on it's dock icon will display previews of all of the open (and non-minimized) windows, e:g:\n\n![compix thumbnail previews](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10033637/18865477/5f9caa2c-8493-11e6-82e3-46fa6b5b2365.png)\n\n**Important**:\n\nIt seems that Compiz does not display or allowed selection of minimized windows in the Scale plugin or its Application Switcher (Alt-Tab replacement). This can cause problems when they need to be unminimized since it means that there's no way to select them. The easiest way to get around this is to use the dock's built in window cycling ability, i.e. by moving the mouse over the dock icon and using the mouse wheel to activate or restore each window in turn.\n"}

Getting libunity on an Ubuntu based distro is easy (and it will probably be installed by default, as is the case with Ubuntu MATE) but its availability may vary on other distros... The applet will still work without problem if libunity is not installed, but obviously will not display counts or progress bars.\n- Firefox needs this extension [detailed  on OMGUbuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/08/firefox-unity-download-progress-bar-addon) to display download counts and progress bars.\n"}

Unfortunately, this is only for the GTK3 version of the applet. Its just not possible to do this sort of thing with Python and GTK2, so GTK2 users are going to be forever stuck with the clunky old method...\n\nThe window list which appears when the mouse hovers over a dock icon has been reworked. This is how it used to look:\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/16.04%20old_win_list.png)\n\nAnd this is how it looks now:\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/16.04%20gtk2%20new%20win%20list.png)\n\nAside from the new look and the fact that app window titles are ellipsized when they get too long, there are a few things to note. Firstly, any additional actions that the app supports are now shown at the top of the window list. In the screenshot above Chrome has two for opening new windows. These actions were previously available from the dock right click menu, but here they're more readily accessible. \n\nSecondly, the option to pin/unpin the app is now always shown at the bottom of the list. Again, this is to make it more accessible. \n\nLastly, when a window is selected the window list no longer closes afterwards. This is to make switching and cycling between multiple open windows much more convenient and much less annoying. To close the window list, simply move the mouse away from it....\n\nThe new window lists work on both GTK2 and GTK3 - the above screenshots were GTK2, the one below is GTK3 on Ubuntu MATE 16.10 Alpha 1:\n\n![](https://github.com/robint99/screenshots/blob/master/16.10%20gtk3%20with%20actions.png)\n\nNote that the separators in this screenshot appear narrower than in the others because a different GTK theme is being used and it draws separators differently... Also note that further changes to the window list will follow in the future, and it is still work in progress.\n\nThe final change for this release is that the way in which the dominant colour of the current wallpaper is calculated has been changed is and is now quicker and lighter on resources than before.\n"}

For each window, the list displays the app icon, an indicator showing which window is currently active, the window title, and a close icon. Clicking the close icon closes the window, clicking anywhere else   makes the window active.\n\nRemoved the list of app windows from the applet right click menu as they are no longer required.\n\nChanged the way the applet works when a running app's dock icon is clicked. This no longer minimizes/maximises all windows, but simply activates the app's last active window.\n\nUsing the mouse scroll wheel over a running app's dock icon now scrolls through each of the app's open windows, unminimizing them and activating them as necessary\n\n.desktop files located in the user's home directory now take    precedence over those located elsewhere in the filesystem. This allows users to create their own .desktop files (e.g. to customize an app's icon)   and have them recognized by the applet.\n\nChanged factory service file to explicitly invoke applet with python 3\n\nThe applet now saves its settings in ~/.config/mate_dock_applet.conf as well as in dconf. On first being added to a panel, the applet checks to see if this file exists and if it does it offers to use this configuration. This allows e.g. an easy way to restore the applet after an accidental deletion from the panel, and also a way to move applet configurations from one computer to another.\n"}
