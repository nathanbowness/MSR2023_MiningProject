python-registry
===============

Introduction
------------
python-registry is a pure Python library that provides read-only
access to Windows NT Registry files.
These include NTUSER.DAT, userdiff, and SAM. The interface is two-fold:
a high-level interface suitable for most tasks, and a low level
set of parsing objects and methods which may be used for advanced
study of the Windows NT Registry. The library is portable across all
major platforms.

Usage
-----

Most users will find the `Registry.Registry` module most appropriate.
The module exposes three classes: the `Registry`, the `RegistryKey`,
and the `RegistryValue`. The `Registry` organizes parsing and access
to the Windows Registry file. The `RegistryKey` is a convenient
interface into the tree-like structure of the Windows NT Registry.
A `RegistryKey` may have children `RegistryKeys`, and may also have
values associated with it. A `RegistryValue` can be thought of as
the tuple (name, datatype, value) associated with a `RegistryKey`.
python-registry supports all major datatypes, such as `RegSZ`,
`RegDWord`, and `RegBin`.

To open a Windows Registry file, its this easy:


    import sys
    from Registry import Registry
    
    reg = Registry.Registry(sys.argv[1])


Print all keys in a Registry


    def rec(key, depth=0):
        print "\t" * depth + key.path()
    
        for subkey in key.subkeys():
            rec(subkey, depth + 1)
    
    rec(reg.root())


Find a key and print all string values


    try:
        key = reg.open("SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run")
    except Registry.RegistryKeyNotFoundException:
        print "Couldn't find Run key. Exiting..."
        sys.exit(-1)
    
    for value in [v for v in key.values() \
                       if v.value_type() == Registry.RegSZ or \
                          v.value_type() == Registry.RegExpandSZ]:
        print "%s: %s" % (value.name(), value.value())


Advanced users who wish to study the structure of the Windows
Registry may find the `Registry.RegistryParse` module useful.
This module implements all known structures of the Windows Registry.

  - Bug reports.
  - Feedback.

python-registry was originally developed to scratch one of
the author's itches.  Now he hopes it can be of use to
someone outside of his lonely NYC apartment.


License
-------
As of version 0.2.0, python-registry is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
Before that, python-registry was released under the GPLv3.


Sources
-------
Nearly all structure definitions used in python-registry
came from one of two sources:
1) WinReg.txt, by B.H., which may be accessed at:
   http://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/WinReg.txt
2) The Windows NT Registry File Format version 0.4, by
   Timothy D. Morgan, which may be accessed at:
   https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsentinelchicken.com%2Fdata%2FTheWindowsNTRegistryFileFormat.pdf
Copies of these resources are included in the
`documentation/` directory of the python-registry source.


The source directory for python-registry contains a `sample/`
subdirectory that contains small programs that use python-registry.
For example, `regview.py` is a read-only clone of Microsoft Window's
Regedit, implemented in a few hundred lines.
