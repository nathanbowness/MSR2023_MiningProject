There is now an all new command decorator that takes all the heavy lifting out of argument parsing!\r\n3.

It is now a regular bot framework that can do other things! Special thanks to @goduncan for this!\r\n- **MAJOR:** HubCommander now has a `@hubcommander_command` decorator to take out most of the heavy lifting for argument parsing. It is a wrapper around Python's `argparse` library with a bunch of other convenience abilities. Please review the [ReadMe for decorators](https://github.com/Netflix/hubcommander/blob/develop/docs/decorators.md) on how to leverage this powerful feature.\r\n- We now have a logo!\r\n- Added `!AddKey`, `!GetKey`, `!ListKeys`, `!DeleteKey` commands for managing GitHub SSH repository deploy keys.  Thanks @willbengtson \r\n- Added new features: `!SetTopics` for adding GitHub repository topics\r\n- Fixed some bugs\r\n- Added some unit tests for decorators\r\n\r\n\r\nPRs:\r\n------\r\n1. #35 \r\n1. #36 \r\n1. #38 \r\n1. #40 \r\n1. #44 \r\n1. #45 \r\n1. #49 \r\n1. #51 \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n--------------\r\n- @goduncan\r\n- @willbengtson \r\n- @dmart \r\n"}
