[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3989/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3989) [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a99505cea4bd4cd195b9b65b6114ee90)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/alicevision/CCTag?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=alicevision/CCTag&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Detection of CCTag markers made up of concentric circles. Implementations in both CPU and GPU.

The library is the implementation of the paper:

Marker library
---------

Markers to print are located [here](markersToPrint).

**WARNING**
Please respect the provided margins. The reported detection rate and localization accuracy are valid with completely planar support: be careful not to use bent support (e.g. corrugated sheet of paper).

The four rings CCTags will be available soon.

CCTags requires either CUDA 8.0 and newer or CUDA 7.0 (CUDA 7.5 builds are known to have runtime errors on some devices including the GTX980Ti). The device must have at least compute capability 3.5.

Check your graphic card CUDA compatibility [here](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/wiki/Compatibility).

Building
--------

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) text file.

Running
-------

Once compiled, you might want to run the CCTag detection on a sample image:

```bash
$ build/src/detection -n 3 -i sample/01.png
```
For the library interface, see [ICCTag.hpp](src/cctag/ICCTag.hpp).
