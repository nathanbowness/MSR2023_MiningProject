This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`.\r\n\r\n    Use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely.\r\n\r\n*   Responses now expose the HTTP status code and headers from Splash as `response.splash_response_status` and `response.splash_response_headers` (#158)\r\n\r\n*   The `meta` argument passed to the `scrapy_splash.request.SplashRequest` constructor is no longer modified (#164)\r\n\r\n*   Website responses with 400 or 498 as HTTP status code are no longer handled as the equivalent Splash responses (#158)\r\n\r\n*   Cookies are no longer sent to Splash itself (#156)\r\n\r\n*   `scrapy_splash.utils.dict_hash` now also works with `obj=None` (225793b)\r\n\r\n*   Our test suite now includes integration tests (#156) and tests can be run in parallel (6fb8c41)\r\n\r\n*   There\u2019s a new \u2018Getting help\u2019 section in the `README.rst` file (#161, #162), the documentation about `SPLASH_SLOT_POLICY` has been improved (#157) and a typo as been fixed (#121)\r\n\r\n*   Made some internal improvements (ee5000d, 25de545, 2aaa79d)"}
