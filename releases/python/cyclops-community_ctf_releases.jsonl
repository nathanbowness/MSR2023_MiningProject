The release also includes bug fixes, improvements to start-up time at larger parallel scale, capability for writing tensors to disk via MPI_I/O,  and improvements for multitype contraction/summation support.  Semantics of Transform with sparse output changed for summations to only modify existing sparse elements rather than create new nonzeros.\n\nStrong and weak scalability plots of this version for the sparse MP3 code in examples/sparse_mp3.cxx are below\n[spmp3_ss_edison_jul2016.pdf](https://github.com/solomonik/ctf/files/388215/spmp3_ss_edison_jul2016.pdf)\n[spmp3_ws_edison_jul2016.pdf](https://github.com/solomonik/ctf/files/388223/spmp3_ws_edison_jul2016.pdf)\n"}

Renewed support for CUDA-based offloading\n2. New macro -DTUNE, activates model tuning, which adjusts performance model parameters. A benchmark aimed to execute a characteristic training set is included in bench/model_trainer and can be used to tune models for any architecture. Output at the end of the benchmark should be pasted into src/shared/init_models.cxx. It is not advisable to always run with -DTUNE on. Current parameters are based on a 16 node Edison runs with 4 processes per node and should be reasonable in most settings. Cubic polynomial model also available, but not used due to inferior observed modelling quality.\n3. Added a mapping search that exhaustively tries all possible mappings. As no effective benefit was observed from this expanded search space and the search itself slowed time down for low-cost contractions (e.g. in CCSDT), this mapping search is only done when the time estimated by the old scheme is longer than 1 second.\n4. Fixed up configure file and generated config.mk file to be more effective and better documented.\n"}
