The prior routine could fail to identify some paths that could be joined. While the new routine runs in about the same amount of execution time as the old one and does not typically change plot time, some grid-based plots with heavy endpoint overlap are seeing reductions of up to 15% in plot time.\r\n- [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/): Plots run via the Python API can now be paused by a keyboard interrupt.\r\n- Removed `bezier_segmentation_tolerance` and `smoothness` parameters from configuration file; replaced with a single `curve_tolerance` parameter that has physical units. If you use a custom configuration file that specifies the old parameters, you may need to update your configuration file.\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes, improvements, and maintenance:\r\n\r\n- Add notice in AxiDraw Naming utility that  updating firmware will removed any assigned nickname.\r\n- [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) and [CLI API](https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/): Add support for Python 3.11. Python 3.7 - 3.11 are now supported.\r\n- [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/): Now also raise an error _in the Plot context_ on failure to connect or loss of USB connectivity.\r\n- [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/): The `fw_version_string` variable is now always populated by [plot_run()](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/#plot_run), for any mode that connects to the hardware via USB.\r\n- Bug fix: When using digital output B3 and also having a physical transit time for the pen to raise and lower, B3 will switch at the beginning of the transit time, not the end. (Fixes issue introduced in prior version.)\r\n- Removed API changelog notes in the online [CLI API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) and [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) documentation for changes older than two years. These entries are still available in the archived download of the previous API version, and the extended changelog is still available in changelog.txt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Getting the software\r\n\r\n**Inkscape (GUI) software releases** are hosted at https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation (short link: https://axidraw.com/sw ).

(Previously, each had an immutable default value.) While potentially useful in the Python API, this adds significant capability to the AxiDraw Command-line Interface [AxiCLI](https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/): You can now use separate config files in AxiCLI to (e.g.) cycle the pen, perform manual walks, or plot the document.\r\n- Issue #126: AxiCLI now returns a non-zero exit code on keyboard or pause button interrupt\r\nwhile plotting (but not during delays between multiple pages), as well as on\r\ncertain errors, such as an initial failure to connect over USB or the loss of an active USB connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes, improvements, and maintenance:\r\n- General documentation updates for the [CLI API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) and [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/).\r\n- Issue #131: Python Interactive API will now raise an error on movement commands when no USB connection is active.\r\n  - Related: Updated all Python API examples, ensuring that each demonstrates checking for an active connection.\r\n  - Related: Updated Python API documentation to ensure that each example shows checking for an active connection.\r\n  - Related: Update Python API documentation: Emphasize that it is important to check for an active connection.\r\n- Issue #132: Fixed an issue where the AxiCLI progress bar could fail to initialize properly when resuming a plot.\r\n- Renamed Python example script low-level_usb.py -> low_level_usb.py\r\n- Streamline feedback to user when the USB connection is lost during a plot; reduce possible duplicate error messages and (by default) do not print the exact command/response that indicated the loss of connection.\r\n- Fix a case where a warning message could be printed multiple times.\r\n- Fixed an issue that could cause an erroneous warning message to be printed when exceeding plot bounds.\r\n- Fixed an issue with AxiDraw Layer Control and per-layer pen-down height settings.\r\n- Use a short timeout interval when checking online for updates.\r\n- Re-order information printed when checking online for updates.\r\n- Significant refactoring and reorganization of the main code base. \r\n- Avoid a traceback on certain types of malformed SVG objects.\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Getting the software\r\n\r\n**Inkscape (GUI) software releases** are hosted at https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation (short link: https://axidraw.com/sw ).

Useful for resetting any changes made by other manual walks.\r\n* Add AxiDraw SE/A1 and SE/A2 as default models, available to select in Inkscape-based GUI, Python API, and CLI API.\r\n* Improved model for time duration of raising/lowering pen-lift servo motor, initially motivated by a bug in time calculations (when using custom configured travel endpoints) identified in https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/pull/118\r\n* [Command-line Interface (CLI) API](https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/) Add Control+C as a software-controlled method to pause a plot in progress, motivated by https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/issues/75.\r\n* New `connected` variable in [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) that can be polled to report whether the computer is currently connected to the AxiDraw through an open serial connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes, improvements, and maintenance:\r\n* Fix an error that was causing layer-based programmatic pauses to not work when plotting in Layers mode.\r\n* The internal \"global step counters\" are no longer automatically cleared when plotting or updating parameters. Only when first energizing the motors at a given resolution. This makes the QS and HM EBB commands more useful, as the step counters more likely reflect the position where the motors were initially energized, assuming firmware 2.6.2 or newer.\r\n* Updated lxml dependency to v 4.6.5 following a security advisory.\r\n* Documentation updates ([CLI API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/), [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/), [Inkscape extensions](http://axidraw.com/guide)) for the new and updated features.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/evil-mad/axidraw/releases/60433481/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

An archive for manual installation is attached to this release as well.\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Key changes\r\n\r\n* Significantly faster processing of the SVG document before starting a plot or rendering a preview. Sincere thanks to Michal Migurski @migurski for contributing this improvement. The degree of speedup will depend on the nature and size of the document. In some cases, plots and plot previews that took minutes to start will now begin in seconds.\r\n\r\n* Webhook notifications. If enabled, the AxiDraw software can post to a specified URL when a plot completes. This can be used, in combination with various services including IFTTT, to provide various forms of notifications and operations such as email alerts, mobile alerts, or integration with other hardware. Added some extended [documentation](http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Webhooks) on our Wiki about how to use this feature.\r\n\r\n* Python and CLI APIs can now output a \"plot digest object\", or \"Plob\" file instead of a full SVG. The Plob is a restricted-format subset of SVG that the AxiDraw software reduces the file to before plotting. It represents the state of the file after stripping out items that will not be plotted and after optimizing what remains. In cases where it is helpful to optimize a file for speed before plotting and plot later (or optimize once and plot many times), it may be helpful to first digest the document to a Plob, and then plot that Plob later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minor features related to the above key changes\r\n\r\n* Added two new spatial index scripts to [plotink](https://github.com/evil-mad/plotink): An R-tree used to speed searches for nearby path ends and a grid index used for nearest-neighbor searches\r\n* Added new `webhook` and `webhook_url` entries to the Inkscape GUI, the configuration file, and the list of options for the AxiDraw [CLI API](https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/)  and [Python API](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/).\r\n* Added new `digest` option to the AxiDraw CLI API and Python API, which can not only output the Plob digest, but also (optionally) disable plotting or previewing a file to do so more quickly.

Both contain a permalink to the latest release of the API download as well as installation instructions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Under the hood\r\n\r\nFrom a development standpoint, version 3.0 represents a major refactoring and significant change in the strategy of how the AxiDraw plots SVG documents.\r\n\r\nHistorically, this software (following antecedent projects like EggBot) has parsed the SVG document essentially one element at a time, plotting each element, and then going onto the next element in the document. The advantages of this scheme include a short time interval between initiating a plot and actually plotting, because the document is parsed piecemeal, and each element is planned at the moment that we get to it. This distributes the \"up front\" computation time for parsing different types of SVG elements across the duration of the plot.\r\n\r\nStarting with version 3.0, a copy of the SVG document is now fully processed to create an intermediate \"digest\" prior to plotting, and plotting is performed from the digest only.  (In cases where the software returns the SVG to the user -- for example when using Inkscape or when rendering a preview -- that SVG is rendered starting from the original document, pre-digest.)\r\n\r\nThis method adds overhead in terms of memory use and initial computation time, but has two key advantages:\r\n\r\n(1) Errors in parsing the SVG document can only occur before plotting starts, not while plotting\r\n\r\n(2) The digest reduces the document to a list of simple \"vertex list\" paths only. \r\n\r\nWe now start with the inherently *destructive* process of replacing all of our paths with simple vertex lists. Doing so, we gain much more latitude for types of processing that were not previously possible (without ruining the essential character of the original SVG). For example, when all objects on a layer are converted to lists of vertices, it's easy to reverse paths, and it's easy to optimize even between subpaths of different compound paths. And so forth.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the AxiDraw software has always reduced each curve to a vertex list at some point in the plotting process -- no changes to curve handling in this update -- but now we're doing it *up front*, so that we can take advantage of that with better plot optimization.\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Notable changes\r\n\r\n* The plot optimization functions have been fully rewritten.\r\n  * Optimizes order individual subpaths from compound paths\r\n  * More effective detection of paths that can be joined together\r\n  * If enabled, plot optimization can automatically reverse paths\r\n* New option to randomize start location of closed paths\r\n* Redesigned GUI for Axidraw Control Inkscape extension\r\n  * Options are now subdivided, reducing the number of main tabs\r\n  * More compact; takes up less screen space\r\n* Updated documentation, across the board:\r\n  * Updated AxiDraw user guide: http://axidraw.com/guide\r\n  * Updated python API documentation, complete with changelog: https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/ \r\n  * Updated CLI API documentation, complete with changelog: https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/\r\n* Old Plot optimization tool deprecated, renamed to `Plot optimization (Legacy)`.\r\n* CLI API: New `axicli --version` command (in addition to `axicli version`)\r\n* Fixed incorrectly bundled EggBot hatch fill .inx file"}

Future releases will only work under python 3.\r\n* The Mac, Windows, and Linux releases of the AxiDraw software for Inkscape now also include the EggBot and WaterColorBot software for Inkscape.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Installing the Inkscape-based versions of this software:\r\n\r\nInstaller applications and instructions are maintained at [https://axidraw.com/sw](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation) and summarized below. We *do not* guarantee that you can successfully install a working copy of the software from the files in the repository at any given moment and highly recommend that you follow one of our instructions for the tested and curated packages linked here instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mac (macOS 10.11-10.15)\r\n\r\n1. Download and run the Mac installer, `AxiDraw_Mac_263.zip`, linked in the assets below.\r\n\r\n2. Download and install [Inkscape 1.0 for Mac](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0/mac-os-x/1010-1015/dl/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n1. Download and run the Windows installer, `AxiDraw_263r2.exe`, linked in the assets below.\r\n\r\n2. Download and install [Inkscape 1.0 for Windows](https://inkscape.org/release/1.0/windows/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nInstall and launch Inkscape 1.0. Then, download and unzip `ad_ink1_263r2.zip`, linked in the assets below. Copy its contents -- about 32 files and folders, not one folder containing them -- into your Inkscape User Extensions directory and relaunch Inkscape.  You can find the location of your User Extensions directory from within the \"system\" tab of your Inkscape Preferences.\r\n\r\nYou may also need to add your user name to the `dialout` group in order to access the USB port. Please see:\r\nhttps://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Installing_software#Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## User Guide\r\n\r\nThe current version of the PDF AxiDraw User Guide is available to download at [http://axidraw.com/guide](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/AxiDraw_User_Guide).  This is the primary user guide for the AxiDraw and includes instructions for using the machine itself as well as its Inkscape-based software.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Python and CLI (command-line interface) versions of this software:\r\n\r\nThe AxiDraw API, in both its python module and CLI forms, can be installed following the specific instructions listed given on the documentation pages for the [python module](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/) or [command-line interface](https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/).   While there is extensive and separate documentation for the two APIs, one installer installs both pieces of software.\r\n\r\nThe API software is also available to download as `AxiDraw_API.zip`, linked in the assets below.  \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n### Firmware Update\r\n\r\nA firmware update, to EBB firmware v 2.6.5 is recommended for all AxiDraw machines, if you have older firmware installed. You can check which version you have by using the \"Config\" tab of the software.\r\n\r\n- Mac users: Download Firmware_v265_Mac.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB. \r\n- Windows users: Download and run Firmware_v265_Win.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB.\r\n- Linux users: Please follow the directions [here](http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Updating_EBB_firmware), using the attached file Firmware_v265_Raw.zip.\r\n\r\n"}

"https://api.github.com/repos/evil-mad/axidraw/zipball/v1.7.8-r1", "body": "This update contains a significant number of changes. We would recommend that all users upgrading read through the updated [AxiDraw User Guide](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/AxiDraw_User_Guide).\r\n\r\n### Enhancements and bug fixes in this release include: \r\n\r\n* New preview mode\r\n   * Preview mode shows what a plot will look like, and shows pen-up moves\r\n   * Can be used for off-line simulation, without the AxiDraw present.\r\n   * Option to show pen-down movement, pen-up movement, or both\r\n   * Also allows one to calculate plot duration (#27) and total path length drawn\r\n* New multiple-copies feature\r\n  * Plot a full file, or certain layers some number of times or continuously\r\n  * An optional delay can be added between subsequent plots\r\n* Add a range of new per-layer controls\r\n  * Add escape sequence for layers that should not be printed (#29)\r\n  * Add optional delay between layers via escape sequence\r\n  * Control codes allow speed and pen height control per layer. Documentation at: http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/AxiDraw_Layer_Control\r\n* Improve the clarity and layout of the Inkscape-extension GUI. Some controls (such as pen lift and lowering speeds) changed from numeric to pop-up multiple choice.\r\n* Add a new user-facing control for acceleration rate.\r\n* Faster parsing of plots.\r\n* Much more responsive pause/resume functionality.\r\n* More responsive setup mode.\r\n* Add support for SVG symbol tags.\r\n* Gracefully ignore several additional SVG elements, including font and anchor tags.\r\n* Save a random seed that can be used when pausing and resuming.\r\n* Add feature to Hershey Text to preview only handwriting-like samples\r\n* Layers hidden via the GUI will not be plotted\r\n* Many under-the-hood changes to support future CLI interface\r\n* Support for alternate size machines: AxiDraw V3 XLX, AxiDraw V3/A3\r\n* Automatically check for power supply plugged in\r\n* A large number of bug fixes including:\r\n   * Certain glitches when pausing and resuming have been identified and removed (#12)\r\n   * When resuming, no longer re-draw the last segment drawn before pausing. \r\n   * Gracefully handle return-to-home request when no resume data found\r\n   * Fix bug that could cause loss of resume data when pressing button out of sequence\r\n   * A rare and long-standing bug (#14) was fixed. It could cause a stray line to be drawn when a duplicate point exists on a path _and_ acceleration is enabled _and_ the speed is slow enough.\r\n   * A rare and long-standing bug was fixed that could cause a segment to be skipped when a duplicate point exists on a path.\r\n   * A rare and long-standing bug was fixed that could cause a segment to be skipped when traveling near maximum speed, and hitting a segment of just the right length.\r\n   * Do not throw an error if the plot area exceeds allowable boundaries by less than one motor step worth of distance; prevents possible error when paths bump up against x=0 or y=0.\r\n   * Properly ignore invisible nodes\r\n   * Handle various error displays more gracefully.\r\n   * Handle USB connection loss more gracefully (#32).\r\n   * Corner handling improved to take care of a number of issues including #41.\r\n   * Significant internal refactoring to manage acceleration and maximum speeds on a more consistent basis.\r\n   * Better handling of pen-up position at reset. \r\n   * Improved handling of polyline objects\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feedback and bug reports are highly welcome._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Installation: \r\n\r\nInstaller applications and instructions are maintained at [https://axidraw.com/sw](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation)\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading, you can either use installers and instructions or perform a manual installation, as described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (Optional) Manual installation instructions: \r\n\r\n\r\n**Mac:**\r\n * Download v178_Mac_Linux.zip and unzip it (11 files plus one folder)\r\n * In the finder, open a new window (File > New Finder Window) and then select Go > Go to Folder...\r\n * Paste the following folder location into the dialog box:\r\n`/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/share/inkscape/extensions/`\r\nand click the \"Go\" button to open that location. This is your \"Inkscape extensions\" folder.\r\n * Copy the 11 files plus one folder into your Inkscape extensions folder, overwriting any like-named files there.\r\n\r\n**Windows:**\r\n * Download v178_Win.zip and unzip it (11 files plus one folder)\r\n* Your extensions directory is usually located at:\r\n`C:\\Program Files\\Inkscape\\share\\extensions\\`\r\nor possibly\r\n`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inkscape\\share\\extensions\\`\r\n * Copy the 11 files plus one folder into your Inkscape extensions directory, overwriting any like-named files there.\r\n * Note that we generally recommend running the full installer, as it also contains a USB driver. If you need to manually install the driver, download and run UBWDriverInstaller_v20.exe.\r\n\r\n**Linux:**\r\n * Download v178_Mac_Linux.zip and unzip it (11 files plus one folder)\r\n * Your extensions directory is usually located at:\r\n`~/.config/inkscape/extensions`\r\n  * Copy the 11 files plus one folder into your Inkscape extensions directory, overwriting any like-named files there.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Firmware Update\r\n\r\nA firmware update, to EBB firmware v 2.6.2 is recommended for all AxiDraw machines, if you currently have older firmware installed. You can check which version you have by using the \"Version\" tab in the software.\r\n\r\n- Mac users: Download Firmware_v262_Mac.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB. \r\n- Windows users: Download and run Firmware_v262_Win.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB.\r\n- Linux users: Please follow the directions [here](http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Updating_EBB_firmware), using the attached file Firmware_v262_Raw.zip.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Additional notes:\r\n\r\nWe are _not_ yet recommending an upgrade to Inkscape 0.92. (Why? We have still heard regular reports of installation difficulty and font handling is not as reliable in the new version.) Barring unexpected changes, the next major release of AxiDraw software will _require_ Inkscape 0.92. Please contact technical support if you would prefer to use 0.92 in the short term; we are in final testing of the new version and could use a few more beta testers. :)"}

https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/issues/7 : Allow each SVG layer to be plotted with a different speed and/or pen height.\r\n- https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/issues/11 : Optionally report distance plotted\r\n- https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/issues/17: Use \"sleep\" cycles to pause communication only on longer moves (> 50 ms). This can prevent shuddering/chattering type motion that been observed as a result of slow communications.\r\n- #23 Add manual command to enter bootloader\r\n- Suppress warnings from other layers when plotting a single layer \r\n- Improve speed of parsing SVG file\r\n- A new version of Hershey Text, including many new fonts and an option to create a font table\r\n- Catch and survive certain communication errors that previously would terminate the plot \r\n- Clarify error messages associated with text (flowroot) objects\r\n- Use smaller (higher resolution) time slices while computing trajectories, giving slightly smoother motion.\r\n- Various other fixes for stability and performance\r\n\r\nMac and Windows installers for v1.2.2 are available at: http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation\r\n\r\nThe ZIP archives attached in the release contain the AxiDraw control extensions for manual installation, along with these helpers and dependencies:\r\n- plotink helper routines for Inkscape extensions.\r\n- eggbot_hatch.py and Hershey Text from the [EggBot extensions for Inkscape](https://github.com/evil-mad/EggBot) .\r\n- Pyserial 2.7 (windows) or 3.0 (mac/linux). \r\n\r\nThese ZIP archives are AxiDraw_122_MacLinux.zip and AxiDraw_122_Win.zip.\r\n\r\n**Firmware Update**\r\n\r\nA firmware update, to EBB firmware v 2.5.1 is now recommended for all AxiDraw machines. \r\n- Mac users: Download UpdateEBB_Macv251.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB. \r\n- Windows users: Download and run UpdateEBB_Winv251.zip, and run it with AxiDraw connected to your computer via USB.\r\n- Linux users: Please follow the directions [here](http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Updating_EBB_firmware), using the attached file EBF_v251.zip.\r\n\r\n**Additional notes:**\r\n- We are _not_ yet recommending an upgrade to Inkscape 0.92.\r\n- This release was formerly packaged as v1.2.1, but has been updated to v1.2.2 to correct a packaging error."}
