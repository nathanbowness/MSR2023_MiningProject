Please refer to appropriate release notes for changes between particular `rc` releases.\r\n\r\nKarafka 2.0 is a **major** rewrite that brings many new things to the table but also removes specific concepts that happened not to be as good as I initially thought when I created them.\r\n\r\nPlease consider getting a Pro version if you want to **support** my work on the Karafka ecosystem!\r\n\r\nFor anyone worried that I will start converting regular features into Pro: This will **not** happen. Anything free and fully OSS in Karafka 1.4 will **forever** remain free. Most additions and improvements to the ecosystem are to its free parts. Any feature that is introduced as a free and open one will not become paid.\r\n\r\n### Additions\r\n\r\nThis section describes **new** things and concepts introduced with Karafka 2.0.\r\n\r\nKarafka 2.0:\r\n\r\n- Introduces multi-threaded support for [concurrent work](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Concurrency-and-multithreading) consumption for separate partitions as well as for single partition work via [Virtual Partitions](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Pro-Virtual-Partitions).\r\n- Introduces [Active Job adapter](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Active-Job) for using Karafka as a jobs backend with Ruby on Rails Active Job.\r\n- Introduces fully automatic integration end-to-end [test suite](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/tree/master/spec/integrations) that checks any case I could imagine.\r\n- Introduces [Virtual Partitions](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Pro-Virtual-Partitions) for ability to parallelize work of a single partition.\r\n- Introduces [Long-Running Jobs](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Pro-Long-Running-Jobs) to allow for work that would otherwise exceed the `max.poll.interval.ms`.\r\n- Introduces the [Enhanced Scheduler](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Pro-Enhanced-Scheduler) that uses a non-preemptive LJF (Longest Job First) algorithm instead of a a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) one.\r\n- Introduces [Enhanced Active Job adapter](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Pro-Enhanced-Active-Job) that is optimized and allows for strong ordering of jobs and more.\r\n- Introduces seamless [Ruby on Rails integration](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Integrating-with-Ruby-on-Rails-and-other-frameworks) via `Rails::Railte` without need for any extra configuration.\r\n- Provides `#revoked` [method](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Consuming-messages#shutdown-and-partition-revocation-handlers) for taking actions upon topic revocation.\r\n- Emits underlying async errors emitted from `librdkafka` via the standardized `error.occurred` [monitor channel](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Error-handling-and-back-off-policy#error-tracking).\r\n- Replaces `ruby-kafka` with `librdkafka` as an underlying driver.\r\n- Introduces official [EOL policies](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Versions-Lifecycle-and-EOL).\r\n- Introduces [benchmarks](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/tree/master/spec/benchmarks) that can be used to profile Karafka.\r\n- Introduces a requirement that the end user code **needs** to be [thread-safe](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/FAQ#does-karafka-require-gems-to-be-thread-safe).\r\n- Introduces a [Pro subscription](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Build-vs.-Buy) with a [commercial license](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/blob/master/LICENSE-COMM) to fund further ecosystem development.\r\n\r\n### Deletions\r\n\r\nThis section describes things that are **no longer** part of the Karafka ecosystem.\r\n\r\nKarafka 2.0:\r\n\r\n- Removes topics mappers concept completely.\r\n- Removes pidfiles support.\r\n- Removes daemonization support.\r\n- Removes support for using `sidekiq-backend` due to introduction of [multi-threading](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Concurrency-and-multithreading).\r\n- Removes the `Responders` concept in favour of WaterDrop producer usage.\r\n- Removes completely all the callbacks in favour of finalizer method `#shutdown`.\r\n- Removes single message consumption mode in favour of [documentation](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Consuming-messages#one-at-a-time) on how to do it easily by yourself.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis section describes things that were **changed** in Karafka but are still present.\r\n\r\nKarafka 2.0:\r\n\r\n- Uses only instrumentation that comes from Karafka. This applies also to notifications coming natively from `librdkafka`. They are now piped through Karafka prior to being dispatched.\r\n- Integrates WaterDrop `2.x` tightly with autoconfiguration inheritance and an option to redefine it.\r\n- Integrates with the `karafka-testing` gem for RSpec that also has been updated.\r\n- Updates `cli info` to reflect the `2.0` details.\r\n- Stops validating `kafka` configuration beyond minimum as the rest is handled by `librdkafka`.\r\n- No longer uses `dry-validation`.\r\n- No longer uses `dry-monitor`.\r\n- No longer uses `dry-configurable`.\r\n- Lowers general external dependencies three **heavily**.\r\n- Renames `Karafka::Params::BatchMetadata` to `Karafka::Messages::BatchMetadata`.\r\n- Renames `Karafka::Params::Params` to `Karafka::Messages::Message`.\r\n- Renames `#params_batch` in consumers to `#messages`.\r\n- Renames `Karafka::Params::Metadata` to `Karafka::Messages::Metadata`.\r\n- Renames `Karafka::Fetcher` to `Karafka::Runner` and align notifications key names.\r\n- Renames `StdoutListener` to `LoggerListener`.\r\n- Reorganizes [monitoring and logging](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki/Monitoring-and-logging) to match new concepts.\r\n- Notifies on fatal worker processing errors.\r\n- Contains updated install templates for Rails and no-non Rails.\r\n- Changes how the routing style (`0.5`) behaves. It now builds a single consumer group instead of one per topic.\r\n- Introduces changes that will allow me to build full web-UI in the upcoming `2.1`.\r\n- Contains updated example apps.\r\n- Standardizes error hooks for all error reporting (`error.occurred`).\r\n- Changes license to `LGPL-3.0`.\r\n- Introduces a `karafka-core` dependency that contains common code used across the ecosystem.\r\n- Contains updated [wiki](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/wiki) on everything I could think of.\r\n\r\n### What's ahead\r\n\r\nKarafka 2.0 is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere are several things in the plan already for 2.1 and beyond, including a web dashboard, at-rest encryption, transactions support, and more.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/karafka/karafka/releases/73749569/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

Since we enqueue jobs only from the listeners, we can safely close jobs queue once listeners are done. By extracting this responsibility from listeners, we remove corner cases and race conditions. Note here: for non-blocking jobs we do wait for them to finish while running the `poll`. This ensures, that for async jobs that are long-living, we do not reach `max.poll.interval`.\r\n- `Shutdown` jobs are executed in workers to align all the jobs behaviours.\r\n- `Shutdown` jobs are always blocking.\r\n- Notion of `ListenersBatch` was introduced similar to `WorkersBatch` to abstract this concept.\r\n- Change default `shutdown_timeout` to be more than `max_wait_time` not to cause forced shutdown when no messages are being received from Kafka.\r\n- Abstract away scheduling of revocation and shutdown jobs for both default and pro schedulers\r\n- Introduce a second (internal) messages buffer to distinguish between raw messages buffer and karafka messages buffer\r\n- Move messages and their metadata remap process to the listener thread to allow for their inline usage\r\n- Change how we wait in the shutdown phase, so shutdown jobs can still use Kafka connection even if they run for a longer period of time. This will prevent us from being kicked out from the group early.\r\n- Introduce validation that ensures, that `shutdown_timeout` is more than `max_wait_time`.
