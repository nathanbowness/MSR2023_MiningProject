OSProfiler provides a tiny but powerful library that is used by
most (soon to be all) OpenStack projects and their python clients. It
provides functionality to be able to generate 1 trace per request, that goes
through all involved services. This trace can then be extracted and used
to build a tree of calls which can be quite handy for a variety of
reasons (for example in isolating cross-project performance issues).
