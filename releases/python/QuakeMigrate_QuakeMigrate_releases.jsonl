The codebase has been largely\r\nre-written, delivering dramatic improvements in run-time and memory usage, many\r\nnew features and far greater flexibility to the user. There have also been a\r\nlarge number of bug fixes relating to the stability and performance of the\r\npackage. All users are encouraged to update to this release.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate releasing `v1.1.0` soon, with a significant expansion of\r\ntutorials and related documentation, and some further improvements to\r\nuser-flexbility. (And maybe a couple more bug-fixes!) So please give us your\r\nfeedback!!\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who has been part of the journey so far! With your help,\r\nwe have tested the code thoroughly, but it is inevitable that we won\u2019t\r\nhave covered every possible use-case and combination of parameters \u2013 so please\r\ncontinue to provide feedback. And please let us know when it works well, too!\r\nIt is our favourite source of motivation.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **Cross-platform support:** QuakeMigrate has now been successfully built and\r\n  run on Linux, Mac and Windows! The core development of the code continues to\r\n  be carried out largely on Linux, so additional feedback & testing from\r\n  Windows and Mac users will continue to be appreciated.\r\n* **Documentation:** We now have comprehensive documentation automatically\r\n  built from the source code, plus installation instructions (for Linux, Mac\r\n  and Windows) and a limited set of tutorials. More coming soon!\r\n* **Local magnitude calculation:** support for built-in local magnitude\r\n  calculation (and output of cut raw, real and Wood-Anderson simulated\r\n  waveforms for each event).\r\n* **Single-phase support:** QuakeMigrate now supports flexible multiple-phase\r\n  stacking. For example, users processing Z-only nodal data may wish to only\r\n  stack P-wave onset functions. The flexible implementation allows users to\r\n  design onset functions for any phase of their choosing (with P and S the\r\n  default for the time being). But if you want to design an onset function to\r\n  identify and migrate/stack Vsh, Vsv etc. it is now easy to do!\r\n* **Publication-ready plots:** significant improvements to the information\r\n  content, clarity and aesthetics of automatic plots (including from the\r\n  trigger, locate, local-magnitude calculation and auto-picking modules &\r\n  sub-modules).\r\n* **Examples:** Two new examples; another demonstration of using QuakeMigrate\r\n  to detect and locate high-frequency basal icequakes (amongst crevassing\r\n  noise!), plus detecting dike-induced earthquakes during the 2014\r\n  B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion - featuring an event rate of more than\r\n  150 earthquakes per hour (~ 4000 per day!).\r\n* **Tests:** we have made our first steps on the journey to including a\r\n  comprehensive suite of tests, to verify correct operation after installation.\r\n  These are based on the included `icequake_iceland` and `dike_intrusion`\r\n  example use-cases. More to come soon.\r\n* **Logging:** flexible log output \u2013 currently split mainly between \u201cinfo\u201d,\r\n  \u201cwarning\u201d and \u201cdebug\u201d levels. We recommend sticking with the default \u2013\r\n  \u201cdebug\" returns a lot of additional info!!\r\n* **Modularity:** the picker and onset sub-modules are now built on an abstract\r\n  base class, making it straightforward to build and share new alternatives\r\n  that integrate with the core migration machinery of the package.\r\n* **License:** QuakeMigrate 1.0.0 is released under the GPL v3 license.\r\n\r\n### Users who have been using the `development` branch\r\n`v1.0.0` serves as a citable release of the version of the code that has been\r\navailable on the `development` branch since January 2020 \u2013 however note there\r\nhave been a significant number of further enhancements and bug fixes over this\r\nperiod, particularly since May 2020. We intend to maintain a far more granular\r\nseries of releases in future \u2013 thank you for your patience!\r\n\r\n### Users upgrading from the `0.x.x` series\r\nUsers upgrading from the `0.x.x` series will notice differences in the absolute\r\nvalue of the coalescence functions calculated, due to bug-fixes affecting the\r\ncore migration and stacking functions. However, the relative values of the\r\ncoalescence functions through time should remain largely unchanged, meaning\r\ntrigger results and relative uncertainty estimates are still valid. Absolute\r\nuncertainty estimates, however, were previously being over-estimated, and\r\ntrigger thresholds will need to be updated. To re-emphasise: there have been\r\nmajor bug-fixes and improvements reaching throughout the entire package. To\r\nbenefit from these improvements we highly recommend re-processing the data\r\nthrough all stages (detect, trigger & locate), though we have tried to\r\nincorporate backwards-compatibility for all old output file formats wherever\r\npossible, for example to allow you to solely re-run locate().\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nThis provides a limited summary of the major changes to the code since the\r\nprevious release. For full details please see the linked pull requests, and\r\ncommit messages therein.\r\n\r\n- Change to top-level package name - `QMigrate` \u2192 `quakemigrate` See #85\r\n- `quakemigrate.core`\r\n  * C libraries now build automatically when installing the package.\r\n  * C functions have been cleaned up and documented properly. See #21.\r\n- `quakemigrate.export` \u2013 new!\r\n  * Add some export utilities to a new module (`export`).\r\n  * Currently includes functions to take the outputs of QuakeMigrate to: ObsPy\r\n    catalogue; ObsPy catalogue to NLLoc OBS file; ObsPy catalogue to MFAST SAC\r\n    input; QuakeMigrate to pyrocko Snuffler input.\r\n- `quakemigrate.io`\r\n  * Refactor the I/O system entirely. This was in response to Issue #66. See\r\n    68c13f7 for full details.\r\n  * The re-write of the `quakemigrate.io.data` sub-module includes fixing bugs\r\n    and making breaking changes related to the detrending and\r\n    upsampling/decimation of waveform data. See c1ff447 and #103.\r\n  * Add support for reading response information (via a light wrapper of the\r\n    obspy function) and functions for response removal & Wood-Anderson\r\n    seismogram simulation, for use with the new\r\n    `quakemigrate.signal.local_mag` module.\r\n  * Add a new, more comprehensive, transparent & flexible\r\n    `check_availability()` function, to check what data is available given a\r\n    set of provided quality criteria.\r\n  * Added functions for removing response and simulating WA response\r\n    here, allowing for this functionality to be accessed from anywhere across\r\n    the package. This includes the ability to output real and/or WA cut\r\n    waveforms (as velocity or displacement seismograms), for example for\r\n    spectral analysis. Response removal parameters are specified (along\r\n    with the instrument response inventory) when creating the `Archive`\r\n    object.\r\n  * The format of triggered event files, event files, pick files and\r\n    station-availabiity files have been heavily overhauled. See #76.\r\n  * Fix to allow for numerical station names.\r\n- `quakemigate.lut` \u2013 significant rewrite (see #54, #65)\r\n  * Significant changes to API \u2013 see examples.\r\n  * Users from the 0.x series will need to update their look-up table files\r\n    (using an included utility function) or re-compute them.\r\n  * Fully-documented, including a tutorial in the documentation.\r\n  * Handling of a possible bug/ambiguity in the scipy RegularGridInterpolator\r\n    API. The default for the fill_value parameter does not appear to be\r\n    consistent with documentation.\r\n  * The traveltime lookup tables are now stored in a dictionary structure\r\n    `maps[station][phase]` to enable migration of a flexible combination of\r\n    seismic phases, and to make it possible to migrate onsets for a subset of\r\n    the phases and stations contained in the LUT. See #75, #103.\r\n  * The 3-D grid on which the lookup tables are defined is now more intuitive\r\n    to build. The user simply chooses the positions of a pair of opposite\r\n    corners (the lower-left and upper-right) in geographic coordinates, the\r\n    geographic and cartesian projections (using pyproj), and a node spacing\r\n    along each axis.\r\n    The number of grid nodes will be calculated automatically to span the\r\n    volume of interest.\r\n  * User-specified units: the user must specify when making an LUT whether to\r\n    use units of metres or kilometres; this will then be used consistently\r\n    throughout the package. See #79.\r\n- `quakemigrate.plot` \u2013 new! See #83.\r\n  * Extracted all base plotting methods to individual modules within the\r\n    `quakemigrate.plot` module. No longer using a class to pass the information\r\n    around.\r\n  * Revamp all of the figures produced by QuakeMigrate to include more useful\r\n    information and to make better use of the available space. See 72b1c47 for\r\n    details.\r\n- `quakemigrate.signal`\r\n  * Refactor to be more flexible with the input data.\r\n    * QuakeMigrate now allows for single-component data to be used, or\r\n      stacking to be performed on just one phase (e.g. just P or just S). The\r\n      required changes reached quite deep into the package and have changed how\r\n      Onset objects are created, but is ultimately very straightforward to use.\r\n      See #103.\r\n    * Channel names can now be specified by the user, by default they are \u201cZ\u201d\r\n      for vertical component, and \u201c[N,1]\u201d and [\u201cE,2\u201d] for horizontal\r\n      components.\r\n  * Internally use `obspy.Trace` objects to store data up to the point of\r\n    passing it to the C functions; this adds greater flexibility and more\r\n    built-in methods for quality checking, filtering, re-sampling etc. than the\r\n    previous framework using arrays.\r\n  * `quakemigate.signal.onsets` \u2013 significant re-write\r\n    * Extracted the embedded onset function generation from the core QuakeScan\r\n      class to a new submodule, `quakemigrate.signal.onsets`.\r\n    * Various changes to parameter names \u2013 see examples.\r\n    * Created an Abstract Base Class \u2013 Onset. This class can be used as a base\r\n      class for a class implementing an alternative onset function algorithm,\r\n      while ensuring compliance with the embedded code in QuakeScan.\r\n    * Created a new class OnsetData to store the pre-processed waveforms used\r\n      for onset calculation, the onset functions themselves, and all associated\r\n      parameters and attributes.\r\n    * Significant expansion to the options available for data quality-checking;\r\n      now exposed to the user, giving the flexibility to select which to use.\r\n    * The STA/LTA onset function remains the default.\r\n  * `quakemigate.signal.pickers` \u2013 significant re-write\r\n    * Extracted the embedded picking functions from the core QuakeScan class to\r\n      a new module, `quakemigrate.signal.pickers`.\r\n    * General improvements to picking through a mix of fixes and features.\r\n      Major improvement to clarity/style.\r\n    * Created an Abstract Base Class \u2013 PhasePicker. This class can be used as a\r\n      base class for a class implementing an alternative phase picking\r\n      algorithm, while ensuring compliance with the embedded code in\r\n      QuakeMigrate.\r\n    * The user can provide a different onset function for phase picking using\r\n      GaussianPicker than they used for migration in locate().\r\n    * Bug fixes related to calculating the pick threshold; new option to use\r\n      the median absolute deviation of the noise, rather than a percentile.\r\n      See #116.\r\n    * Fitting a 1-D Gaussian to the phase onset function remains the default\r\n      method of phase picking.\r\n  * `quakemigate.signal.trigger`\r\n    * Add dynamic trigger threshold method based on the median absolute\r\n      deviation, a robust statistical estimator that is insensitive to extreme\r\n      outliers. See #59.\r\n    * Added the ability to trigger events restricted to a specific region of\r\n      the grid (specified as geographic coordinates, and illustrated on the\r\n      trigger summary plot).\r\n    * Numerous bug-fixes related to the handling of overlapping triggers.\r\n    * Fix an indexing bug in trigger that caused the last event to be missed if\r\n      it was a single sample in length.\r\n  * `quakemigrate.signal.local_mag` \u2013 new! See #71\r\n    * A comprehensive suite of codes for local earthquake magnitude calculation\r\n      by measuring displacement amplitudes from Wood-Anderson simulated\r\n      seismograms.\r\n    * This can optionally be used as part of a locate run to automatically\r\n      output ML estimates for each located event.\r\n- General changes\r\n  * Update to various class attributes. Deprecation warnings + internal\r\n    attribute re-mappings have been included to ease the transition.\r\n  * Add additional examples (Rutford icequakes + Iceland dike intrusion). This\r\n    includes a script that performs data download from IRIS through an FDSN\r\n    client. See #105.\r\n  * Option to locate events from a user-provided triggered event file, as well\r\n    as the existing functionality to automatically read triggers between two\r\n    timestamps from the default output directory structure. See #53.\r\n  * Re-write `setup.py` to automatically build the C extension library and link\r\n    it to the rest of the package. Should be more robust on different\r\n    platforms. Functions to read .dll or .so files (depending on operating\r\n    system) have been added to automatically load the correct linked library.\r\n    See #84.\r\n  * Add a system of module imports through `__init__.py` files to reduce the\r\n    verbosity of input statements.\r\n  * New, intuitive directory structure for outputs, allowing straightforward\r\n    batch processing of data archives. See #68.\r\n  * Option to run trigger() multiple times from the same detect() output by\r\n    using different run sub-names. Also incorporated into the functions used by\r\n    locate() to read triggered event files.\r\n  * Add readthedocs documentation with sphinx. Here we can host the\r\n    documentation for the source code, instructions on installation, and\r\n    tutorials on how to use the package.\r\n  * The internal reference frame has Z being positive down (the depth frame).\r\n    Station elevations in the station input file are in the positive up\r\n    (elevation/natural frame) and converted internally.\r\n  * More information on intermediate results is retained in the final output\r\n    files. For example, the coalescence and normalised coalescence values for a\r\n    triggered event, along with which value it was triggered against.\r\n  * Added tests based on the \"Iceland Icequake\" and \"Volcanotectonic_Iceland\"\r\n    example use-cases to veryify correct operation ofter installation.\r\n  * Added Continuous Integration (Travis CI) allow us to catch breaking\r\n    issues before new features/fixes are merged and, in particular, should\r\n    help us keep on top of changes related to upstream changes to\r\n    dependencies.\r\n  * License: QuakeMigrate v1.0.0 is released under the GPLv3 license.\r\n- Optimisations\r\n  * Optimise compute by changing the flags passed to the the compiler. Bumped\r\n    more of the compute() method to the C library to maximise efficiency.\r\n    See a9ffdb6\r\n  * Moved to logging with the native Python logging module, which allows for\r\n    writing logs to file as well as stdout in a more concise manner. See #81\r\n\r\n## Thanks!\r\nThank you to all those who have contributed to this release, whether by writing\r\ncode, reporting bugs, or suggesting new features and improvements!
