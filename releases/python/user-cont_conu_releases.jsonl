It now returns iterator always. On\r\n  top of it, we have implemented more convenience methods to return logs as\r\n  bytes and unicode.\r\n\r\n* Backend class can (and should) be used as a context manager. This was done\r\n  for the sake of creating a temporary directory meant for the backend\r\n  instance. The context manager ensures the temporary directory will be removed.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* We added support for docker-py version 1 so it can work in CentOS.\r\n* conu will check whether required binaries are present and if not,\r\n  `CommandDoesNotExistException` will be raised.\r\n* Our documentation was improved and contains now more examples and the python\r\n  interface should be explained in more detail.\r\n* When creating docker containers, conu now utilizes option `--cidfile`.\r\n* `execute()` method can be blocking and non-blocking.\r\n* Backend provides new methods `cleanup_containers()` to cleanup containers\r\n  created during the session."}
