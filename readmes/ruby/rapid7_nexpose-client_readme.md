# DEPRECATED
The [RESTful API for the Nexpose/InsightVM Security Console](https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/index.html) has rendered this library obsolete. If you require a Ruby library for that API you can use a [generated client](https://github.com/rapid7/vm-console-client-ruby). Clients for other languages can be generated from the Swagger specification. Note that generated clients are not officially supported or maintained by Rapid7.

While this project is no longer under active development, it is still maintained by Rapid7 for internal testing needs. Pull requests will continue to be reviewed and accepted, and new versions published as requested.

This gem is heavily used for internal, automated testing of the Nexpose product. It provides calls to the Nexpose XML APIs version 1.1 and 1.2, and JSON API 2.1. It also includes a number of helper methods which are not currently exposed through alternate means.

Since version 1.0 nexpose-client uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). This allows for confident use of the [pessimistic operator](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rubys-pessimistic-operator) in scripts or larger ruby projects.
