# Nintendo Clients
> :warning: Keep in mind that Nintendo is actively banning Switch devices. This package tries to mimic the behavior of a real Switch as closely as possible, but using it is at your own risk. Make sure that you know what you are doing.

This package implements a client for various 3DS, Wii U and Switch servers. Check out the [documentation](nintendoclients.readthedocs.io) for the list of servers that are currently supported.

### Installation
This package requires Python 3.8 or later and can be installed with pip: `pip install nintendoclients`.

This package does not have a stable interface yet (it may receive backwards compatibility breaking changes at any time). If you use it in a project, it is recommended to pin a specific version.
