evohome-client
==============

Build status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/watchforstock/evohome-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/watchforstock/evohome-client)

Python client to access the [Total Connect Comfort](https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/Account/Login) RESTful API.

It provides support for **Evohome** and the **Round Thermostat**.  It supports only EU/EMEA-based systems, please use [somecomfort](https://github.com/kk7ds/somecomfort) for US-based systems.

This client uses the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library. If you prefer an async-friendly client, [evohome-async](https://github.com/zxdavb/evohome-async) has been ported to use [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) instead.
