Thanks to all who reported bugs and who are asking me directly via e-mail. Keep on your good work ;) and use my gradle-plugin.\n\n**New:**\n- added `checkForAbsolutePaths`-property to enable absolute paths for all path-properties (it defaults to `false` to behave like before)\n- added `additionalBundlerResources` for being able to have additional files available to the used bundler\n- added feature for copying additionalAppResources to `build/jfx/app` when calling `jfxJar` and `jfxRun`, making it possible to have all that files available (like native files being required to not reside in the jar-files) by setting `copyAdditionalAppResourcesToJar = true` (issue #39)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n- made it possible to specify absolute paths for all path-properties, fixes issue #36\n- reverted the idea of registering the real tasks after project-evaluation, only add ant-javafx.jar after project-evaluation (fixes issue #31)\n- adjusted CI-files for AppVeyor and TravisCI to handle functional tests\n- fixed possible file-handler leak (unreported)\n\n**Changes:**\n- removed the `skipDaemonModeCheck`-property, please remove this from your configuration/buildscript\n\n**Enhancements:**\n- implemented some functional tests, mostly using the example-projects as test-projects (running against Gradle 2.10 and Gradle 3.0)\n- added example project: windows installer with license\n- added example project: debian installer with license\n- added example project: adjusted launcher-icon\n- added example project: additional bundler-files\n- extracted plugin-version into separated file to have example-projects working at their place without having the need to adjust these version-numbers on every release\n- refactored a bit to have cleaner code\n"}

It was the very first time I had to do some JVM-bytecode analysis and using [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/) for the first time for \"hacking\" something existing before using it. As Gradle 3 now uses daemon mode per **default**, it became mandatory to finally find some working fix for it ... but the real fix should come from Oracle, it even got reported by me, but as the javapackager is built with short-living JVMs, this will take its time to get fixed.\n\nFor further information about how this works, please take a look into the `MonkeyPatcher`-class.\n\nAnother thing to mention: this time an enhancement was implemented/integrated and released before the [javafx-maven-plugin](https://github.com/javafx-maven-plugin/javafx-maven-plugin) got it, namely the adjustments for the jfxRun-task, this does **not** mean that the javafx-maven-plugin gets less attention from me.\n\nIf something does NOT work with the new fixes, please report these as seperated issues.\n\nHappy coding! *eats-cake* \ud83c\udf70 \n\nNew:\n- added `alternativePathToJarFile`-property to specify the jar-file which gets used for javafx-jar-transformation\n- added `usePatchedJFXAntLib`-property to disable gradle daemon workaround of the JDK-bug (which might be required when patching does result in crashing the JVM)\n- added `useEnvironmentRelativeExecutables`-property to change the executables being used from the JDK instead of environment-relative (which could differ due to multiple local java-installations)\n- added possibility to adjust java-command used for `jfxRun`-task: it is now possible to pass parameters to your jfx-application\n- added possibility to adjust java-command used for `jfxRun`-task: it is now possible to pass parameters to the java-executable, e.g. to specify some javassist-module or other JVM-related stuff (like Xmx or other funny things)\n\nBugfixes:\n- fixed issue #29 and #30 regarding stdout/stderr not printed when Gradle is in daemon mode (which is default for Gradle 3 now)\n- fixed issue #12 regarding gradle daemon mode: **IT IS NOW SUPPORTED**\n\nChanges:\n- removed the usage of `skipDaemonModeCheck`-property, please remove this from your configuration/buildscript (will be removed in the next minor-release)\n- the javafx-gradle-plugin now requires ASM being present on classpath of the buildscript for being able to work around the JDK-bug (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8148717)\n\nEnhancements:\n- fixed issue #26 by providing a way to specify jar-file used for javapackager\n- updated proguard example using new `alternativePathToJarFile`-property\n- updated README.md to show minimal setup and other stuff\n"}

Available via maven-central, might take some while that it is available (as always).\n\nNew:\n- added new property to skip workaround for gradle daemon mode (which causes problems with the runtime-folder, see issue #12 for more information), this makes it now possible to create native builds within the IDE (at least once)\n\nBugfixes:\n- fixed some classloader-problem when using javafx-gradle-plugin in combination with Netbeans IDE having netbeans-gradle-plugin installed _(I'm very sorry about this, don't know why this wasn't detected by me before)_\n- updated workaround-detection for creating native bundles without JRE, because [it got fixed by latest Oracle JDK 1.8.0u92](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/8u92-bugfixes-2949473.html)\n\nEnhancements:\n- made it possible to specify file-association icon as [String](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html), [File](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html) or [Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html)\n- changed the way for adding `ant-javafx.jar` to the classloaders (by using more stuff provided by the gradle-api)\n\nMigrated from javafx-maven-plugin:\n- (bugfix) added workaround for native linux launcher inside native linux installer bundle (DEB and RPM) not working, see issue [#205](https://github.com/javafx-maven-plugin/javafx-maven-plugin/issues/205) for more details on this (it's a come-back of the [issue 124](https://github.com/javafx-maven-plugin/javafx-maven-plugin/issues/124))\n- (new) added ability to write and use custom bundlers! This makes it possible to customize the work which is required for your bundling-process.\n- (new) added new property to disable \"native linux launcher inside native linux installer\"-fix `skipNativeLauncherWorkaround205 = true`\n- (improvement) moved workarounds and workaround-detection into its own class (makes it a bit easier to concentrate on the main work inside JfxNativeTask)\n\n**Note:**\nThere won't be any [GString](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/lang/GString.html)-support, please use `toString()` inside your buildscript\n\nAnother note: I know, dependency-filtering is not yet implemented, but as this is a rather unused feature, I will take the time ;)\n"}
