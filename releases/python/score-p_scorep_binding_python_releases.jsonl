It introduces the notion of `instrumenters`, which care about the interface between Score-P and Python. Different instrumenters are available. Other changes are:\r\n\r\n* Introduce python context managers (used in the `with` statement) for user regions as well as enabling and disabling the instrumenter\r\n* Use the sys.setprofile for the default instrumenter (should speed up the tracing)\r\n* Allow to \"unregister\" the instrumenter to disable the recording of python calls (unregistering reduces the overhead)\r\n* Add a dummy instrumenter (allows to leave user instrumentation in the code, even if no Score-P is loaded, it does nothing)\r\n* Add rewind support\r\n* Update the CI to bionic"}
