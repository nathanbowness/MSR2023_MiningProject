This makes editing the model easier as there are no doubles to come in the way. This is the better version of the older functionality provided as it now properly controls the normals as well. (Thanks to Colby for the suggestion)\r\n\r\n* <b>Grouping Multiple Materials</b> - As of the latest version, materials which are equal are now grouped together. This helps in editing car parts, the materials of which are duplicated in each part. (again thanks to Colby for this suggestion)\r\n\r\n* <b>Better Compatibility</b> - Thanks to several members who reported importing and exporting issues, the newer version is compatible with more types of DFFs. There is still work to do to support the console models however."}
