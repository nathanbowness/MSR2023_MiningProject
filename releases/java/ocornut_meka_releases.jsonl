[Calindro]\r\n- Z80: Fixed HALT timing. [Calindro]\r\n- VDP: Setting address via palette write preserve upper address bits. Fixes tests #4 and #15 of FluBBA's VDP Tester. [Omar]\r\n- VDP: Writing to palette sets the read buffer. Fixes test #10 of FluBBA's VDP Tester. [Omar]\r\n\r\n**Emulation (Audio)**\r\n- PSG: Added support for Game Gear stereo emulation! [Maxim]\r\n- PSG: Emulate the PSG volumes \"ideally\" rather than matching some real systems' suboptimal output. [Maxim]\r\n- Emu2413: Fixed commands 0x26-0x28 from turning off the drums. [ValleyBell]\r\n- Rewrote sound engine and fixed audio issues that many users had. Still issues and PAL mode are broken... The sound is also now functional under Linux and MacOS. [Omar]  \r\n\r\n**Emulation (Memory System, Mappers, Peripherals)**\r\n- Added support for variant of MSX-based Korean 8KB mapper used by 'Nemesis'. [Omar]\r\n- Added support for '4 PAK All Action' mapper. [Omar]\r\n- Added support for 'Janggun-ui Adeul' mapper.

[Omar]\r\n- Hardware reset leaves RAM cleared with $F0 patterns on Japanese SMS. This allow 'Ali Baba' and 'Block Hole' to run properly. Better clearing patterns could be implemented for other systems/countries after we've done more research. [Omar]\r\n- Added support for mirrored VDP ports in $80..$BF range, as required by some Korean games such as 'Pooyan', 'Sky Jaguar' or 'E.I.'. [Omar]\r\n- Light Phaser: Adding per-game hacky light phaser function to reduce drift between perceived cursor and what the game will end up using, particularly useful for 'Missile Defense 3-D' and '3D Gunner'. [Omar]\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n- Changed default key mapping for Player 1 buttons to use Z/X. [Omar]\r\n- Setup panel allows to select display driver and resolution.

[Omar]\r\n- Added `VARS` command (\"Variables\") to display content pointed by symbols in RAM. [Omar]\r\n- Added `TRACE` command to trace past execution. [Omar]\r\n- Improved the range of disassembly before PC cursor when running loops. [Omar]\r\n- Fixed `CLOCK` command display for period longer than 10 minutes. [Maxim]\r\n- Added support for parsing the bank in NO&GMB/WLA symbol format. Symbols are turned into ROM addresses. [Omar]\r\n- Added support for parsing SJASM symbol format. [Omar]\r\n- Added support for parsing TASM symbol format. [Omar]\r\n- Added a \"Reload Symbols\" menu option (useful when manually crafting symbols while reverse engineering). [Omar]\r\n- Added shortcuts button in interface for \"Stop/Continue\", \"Step\", \"StepOver\", \"StepOut\", \"Stack\". [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: uses recorded Z80 execution history to allow semi-freely scrolling up and down in disassembly. [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: display symbols given their full ROM bank mapping (if bank information is provided by symbols file). [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: display symbols in 'RST xx' instructions. [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: opcodes shown in lower-case, increased spacing for readability. [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: display symbols+offset on JP/JR/CALL/RET/DJNZ instructions. [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: display symbols on IX/IY indexed instructions given the current value of IX/IY. [Omar]\r\n- Disassembler: fixed issues with prefixed instructions. [Omar]\r\n- Improved disassembler view centering, increased the track-back buffer, fixed issues with prefixed instructions. [Omar]\r\n- Better support for 24-bits constants (for `PRINT`, etc.). [Omar]\r\n- Debugger is always available at runtime. Obsoleted /DEBUG command-line parameter. [Omar]\r\n- Debugger window can be resized. [Omar]\r\n\r\n**Tools**\r\n- CheatFinder: added a new cheat finder application. [Omar]\r\n   - Can search for 1-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit values.\r\n   - Can search in RAM,ROM,VRAM,VREG,PRAM,SRAM,Z80 spaces for maximum flexibility,\r\n     although for actual cheat-finding purpose RAM is likely to be more searched for.\r\n   - Reduce the match set by using ==,!=,<,>,<=,>= operators, compare with a constant \r\n      or the old value stored in each match memory location.\r\n   - Highlight matches in the memory editor for easier visibility.\r\n   - Undo button.\r\n- TilemapViewer: support for legacy graphic mode 2 used by SG-1000 games. [Omar]\r\n- TilemapViewer: support for 256x256 tilemap used in PAL/SECAM wide screen mode. [Omar]\r\n- TileViewer: support for showing full 16 KB range of tiles in legacy graphic modes.

[Omar]\r\n- Made \"Ocean\" the default theme and increased default GUI resolution. [Omar]\r\n- Made \"SMS Power! theme more readable. [Omar]\r\n- TextInput: support for text selection, hold SHIFT+Left/Right keys to select text. [Omar]\r\n- TextInput: support for CTRL+Left/Right to jump to previous/next word. [Omar]\r\n- TextInput: support for clipboard (CTRL+X,CTRL+C,CTRL+V) shortcuts, tied to OS clipboard. [Omar]\r\n- Depth order of windows is preserved accross sessions. [Omar]\r\n- Increased mouse horizontal range when using scrollbars. [Omar]\r\n- Added 'game_window_scale' directive on configuration file to resize game window. [Omar]\r\n- Discontinued ALT+P (=F12) and CTRL+X (=F10) shortcuts. [Omar]\r\n- Added ALT+V shortcut to start/stop VGM logging. [Omar]\r\n- Menu entries display their shortcuts. Tidied up some menu entries. [Omar]\r\n- Pressing DEL key in a text input box delete the character ahead of cursor.

[Omar]\r\n- 3-D Glasses mode doesn't halve framerate of the interface anymore. [Omar]\r\n\r\n**Sources/Development**\r\n- Now build with a C++ compiler, fixed all incompatible C constructs + lots of cleanup. Codebase can now freely take advantage of all C++ compiler features. [Omar]\r\n- Updated from Allegro 4 (software rendering based) to Allegro 5.2.40 (with OpenGL/DirectX backends). This required a lot of changes and rewrite in the codebase. It probably added new bugs, and performances seems to vary depending on computer settings and video drivers. [Omar, Maxim] Please do report if you have any issue/slowdown so we can fix them!\r\n- Added a batch script 'tools/dist_bin_win32.bat' to create binary Win32 package. [Omar]\r\n- Removed #ifdef-out code that was used by the MS-DOS version. [Omar]\r\n- Removed code for the old OPL3 based YM2413 emulator. [Omar]\r\n- Removed easter egg code for emulating the NES.
