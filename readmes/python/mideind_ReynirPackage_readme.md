********
Overview
********

Greynir is a Python 3 (>= 3.7) package,
published by `Miðeind ehf. <https://mideind.is>`__, for
**working with Icelandic natural language text**.
Greynir can parse text into **sentence trees**, find **lemmas**,
inflect **noun phrases**, assign **part-of-speech tags** and much more.

Greynir's sentence trees can *inter alia* be used to extract
information from text, for instance about people, titles, entities, facts,
actions and opinions.

Full documentation for Greynir is `available here <https://greynir.is/doc/>`__.

Greynir is the engine of `Greynir.is <https://greynir.is>`__,
a natural-language front end for a database of over 10 million
sentences parsed from Icelandic news articles, and
`Embla <https://embla.is>`__, a voice-driven virtual assistant app
for smart devices such as iOS and Android phones.

Greynir includes a hand-written
`context-free grammar <https://github.com/mideind/GreynirPackage/blob/master/src/reynir/Greynir.grammar>`__
for the Icelandic language, consisting of over 7,000 lines of grammatical
productions in `extended Backus-Naur format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form>`__.
Its fast C++ parser core is able to cope with long and ambiguous sentences,
using an `Earley-type parser <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser>`__
as `enhanced by Scott and Johnstone <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642309000951>`__.

Greynir employs the `Tokenizer <https://pypi.org/project/tokenizer/>`__ package,
by the same authors, to tokenize text, and
uses `BinPackage <https://pypi.org/project/islenska/>`__ as its database of
Icelandic vocabulary and morphology.

********
Examples
********

Use Greynir to easily inflect noun phrases:
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from reynir import NounPhrase as Nl

    # Create a NounPhrase ('nafnliður') object
    karfa = Nl("þrír lúxus-miðar á Star Wars og tveir brimsaltir pokar af poppi")

    # Print the NounPhrase in the correct case for each context
    # (þf=þolfall/accusative, þgf=þágufall/dative). Note that
    # the NounPhrase class implements __format__(), allowing you
    # to use the case as a format specification, for instance in f-strings.

    print(f"Þú keyptir {karfa:þf}.")
    print(f"Hér er kvittunin þín fyrir {karfa:þgf}.")

The program outputs the following text, correctly inflected::

    Þú keyptir þrjá lúxus-miða á Star Wars og tvo brimsalta poka af poppi.
    Hér er kvittunin þín fyrir þremur lúxus-miðum á Star Wars og tveimur brimsöltum pokum af poppi.

Use Greynir to parse a sentence:
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from reynir import Greynir
    >>> g = Greynir()
    >>> sent = g.parse_single("Ása sá sól.")
    >>> print(sent.tree.view)
    P                               # Root
    +-S-MAIN                        # Main sentence
      +-IP                          # Inflected phrase
        +-NP-SUBJ                   # Noun phrase, subject
          +-no_et_nf_kvk: 'Ása'     # Noun, singular, nominative, feminine
        +-VP                        # Verb phrase containing arguments
          +-VP                      # Verb phrase containing verb
            +-so_1_þf_et_p3: 'sá'   # Verb, 1 accusative arg, singular, 3rd p
          +-NP-OBJ                  # Noun phrase, object
            +-no_et_þf_kvk: 'sól'   # Noun, singular, accusative, feminine
    +-'.'                           # Punctuation
    >>> sent.tree.nouns
    ['Ása', 'sól']
    >>> sent.tree.verbs
    ['sjá']
    >>> sent.tree.flat
    'P S-MAIN IP NP-SUBJ no_et_nf_kvk /NP-SUBJ VP so_1_þf_et_p3
        NP-OBJ no_et_þf_kvk /NP-OBJ /VP /IP /S-MAIN p /P'
    >>> # The subject noun phrase (S.IP.NP also works)
    >>> sent.tree.S.IP.NP_SUBJ.lemmas
    ['Ása']
    >>> # The verb phrase
    >>> sent.tree.S.IP.VP.lemmas
    ['sjá', 'sól']
    >>> # The object within the verb phrase (S.IP.VP.NP also works)
    >>> sent.tree.S.IP.VP.NP_OBJ.lemmas
    ['sól']

*************
Prerequisites
*************

This package runs on CPython 3.7 or newer, and on PyPy 3.7 or newer.

To find out which version of Python you have, enter::

    $ python --version

If a binary wheel package isn't available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org>`__
for your system, you may need to have the ``python3-dev`` package
(or its Windows equivalent) installed on your
system to set up Greynir successfully. This is
because a source distribution install requires a C++ compiler and linker::

    $ # Debian or Ubuntu:
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev

Depending on your system, you may also need to install ``libffi-dev``::

    $ # Debian or Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

************
Installation
************

To install this package, assuming Python 3 is your default Python::

    $ pip install reynir

If you have **git** installed and want to be able to edit
the source, do like so::

    $ git clone https://github.com/mideind/GreynirPackage
    $ cd GreynirPackage
    $ # [ Activate your virtualenv here if you have one ]
    $ pip install -e .

The package source code is now in ``GreynirPackage/src/reynir``.

*****
Tests
*****

To run the built-in tests, install `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__,
``cd`` to your ``GreynirPackage`` subdirectory (and optionally activate your
virtualenv), then run::

    $ python -m pytest

**********
Evaluation
**********

A parsing test pipeline for different parsing schemas, including the Greynir schema,
has been developed. It is available `here <https://github.com/mideind/ParsingTestPipe>`__.
