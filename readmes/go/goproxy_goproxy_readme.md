A minimalist Go module proxy handler.

Goproxy has fully implemented the
[GOPROXY protocol](https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol). Our goal is to find
the most dead simple way to provide a minimalist handler that can act as a
full-featured Go module proxy for those who want to build their own proxies.
Yeah, there is no `Makefile`, no configuration files, no crazy file
organization, no lengthy documentation, no annoying stuff, just a
[`goproxy.Goproxy`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goproxy/goproxy#Goproxy) that
implements the [`http.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler).

## Features

* Extremely easy to use
	* Two structs: [`goproxy.Goproxy`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goproxy/goproxy#Goproxy) and [`goproxy.DirCacher`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goproxy/goproxy#DirCacher)
	* One interface: [`goproxy.Cacher`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goproxy/goproxy#Cacher)
* Built-in [`GOPROXY`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables) support
	* Defaulted to `https://proxy.golang.org,direct` (just like what Go is doing right now)
* Built-in [`GONOPROXY`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables) support
* Built-in [`GOSUMDB`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables) support
	* Defaulted to `sum.golang.org` (just like what Go is doing right now)
* Built-in [`GONOSUMDB`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables) support
* Built-in [`GOPRIVATE`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables) support
* Supports serving under other Go module proxies by setting [`GOPROXY`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#environment-variables)
* Supports [proxying checksum databases](http://golang.org/design/25530-sumdb#proxying-a-checksum-database)

## Installation

Open your terminal and execute

```bash
$ # Use it programmatically (RECOMMENDED).
$ go get github.com/goproxy/goproxy
$ # Or use our minimalist CLI implementation.
$ go install github.com/goproxy/goproxy/cmd/goproxy@latest
```

done.

> The only requirement is the [Go](https://go.dev), at least v1.13.

## Quick Start

Create a file named `goproxy.go`

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/goproxy/goproxy"
)

func main() {
	http.ListenAndServe("localhost:8080", &goproxy.Goproxy{})
}
```

and run it

```bash
$ go run goproxy.go
```

then try it by setting `GOPROXY` to `http://localhost:8080` by following the
instructions below. In addition, we also recommend that you set `GO111MODULE` to
`on` instead of `auto` when you are working with Go modules.

### Go 1.13 and above (RECOMMENDED)

Open your terminal and execute

```bash
$ go env -w GOPROXY=http://localhost:8080,direct
```

done.

### macOS or Linux

Open your terminal and execute

```bash
$ export GOPROXY=http://localhost:8080
```

or

```bash
$ echo "export GOPROXY=http://localhost:8080" >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
```

done.

### Windows

Open your PowerShell and execute

```poweshell
C:\> $env:GOPROXY = "http://localhost:8080"
```

or

```md
1. Open the Start Search, type in "env"
2. Choose the "Edit the system environment variables"
3. Click the "Environment Variablesâ€¦" button
4. Under the "User variables for <YOUR_USERNAME>" section (the upper half)
5. Click the "New..." button
6. Choose the "Variable name" input bar, type in "GOPROXY"
7. Choose the "Variable value" input bar, type in "http://localhost:8080"
8. Click the "OK" button
```

done.
