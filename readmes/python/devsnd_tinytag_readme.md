  * Just a few hundred lines of code (just include it in your project!) 

tinytag only provides the minimum needed for _reading_ meta-data.
It can determine track number, total tracks, title, artist, album, year, duration and any more.

    from tinytag import TinyTag
    tag = TinyTag.get('/some/music.mp3')
    print('This track is by %s.' % tag.artist)
    print('It is %f seconds long.' % tag.duration)
    
Alternatively you can use tinytag directly on the command line:

    $ python -m tinytag --format csv /some/music.mp3
    > {"filename": "/some/music.mp3", "filesize": 30212227, "album": "Album", "albumartist": "Artist", "artist": "Artist", "audio_offset": null, "bitrate": 256, "channels": 2, "comment": null, "composer": null, "disc": "1", "disc_total": null, "duration": 10, "genre": null, "samplerate": 44100, "title": "Title", "track": "5", "track_total": null, "year": "2012"}

Check `python -m tinytag --help` for all CLI options, for example other output formats

List of possible attributes you can get with TinyTag:

    tag.album         # album as string
    tag.albumartist   # album artist as string
    tag.artist        # artist name as string
    tag.audio_offset  # number of bytes before audio data begins
    tag.bitdepth      # bit depth for lossless audio
    tag.bitrate       # bitrate in kBits/s
    tag.comment       # file comment as string
    tag.composer      # composer as string 
    tag.disc          # disc number
    tag.disc_total    # the total number of discs
    tag.duration      # duration of the song in seconds
    tag.filesize      # file size in bytes
    tag.genre         # genre as string
    tag.samplerate    # samples per second
    tag.title         # title of the song
    tag.track         # track number as string
    tag.track_total   # total number of tracks as string
    tag.year          # year or date as string

For non-common fields and fields specific to single file formats use extra

    tag.extra         # a dict of additional data

The `extra` dict currently *may* contain the following data:
   `url`, `isrc`, `text`, `initial_key`, `lyrics`, `copyright`

Aditionally you can also get cover images from ID3 tags:

    tag = TinyTag.get('/some/music.mp3', image=True)
    image_data = tag.get_image()

To open files using a specific encoding, you can use the `encoding` parameter.
This parameter is however only used for formats where the encoding isn't explicitly
specified.

    TinyTag.get('a_file_with_gbk_encoding.mp3', encoding='gbk')
