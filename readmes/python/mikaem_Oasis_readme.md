Description
-----------

Oasis is a high-level/high-performance Open Source Navier-Stokes solver written in Python. The solver has been found to scale well weakly up to 256 CPUs on the Abel supercomputer at the University of Oslo. The scaling test was using the P2P1 version of the NSfracStep solver with IPCS_ABCN.

    Weak scaling on the Abel supercomputer. Timings are sampled every 10'th time step. The figure shows both the best result (over 10 time steps), the worst, and the standard deviation of the timings.
