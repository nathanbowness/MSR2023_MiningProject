Fixed the issue that causes the wrong odds (due to selecting the wrong defender) to be displayed if units from different players were on the same plot\r\n- BUG37: Fix strange divide by zero bug in CvPlayerAI::AI_transferYieldValue. It's weird that this happened so I am adding an assert to help detect issues caused by variables unexpectedly having negative values!\r\n- BUG38: Adapted from K-mod, alberts2, DarkLunaPhantom. Various fixes concerning \"Typos, order of operations mistakes, memory leaks, missing initialisers, style changes.\"\r\n- BUG40: Adapted from K-mod. Whenever we check the attitude towards our own team, we're always friendly :P\r\n- BUG41: Adapted from K-mod \\ Unofficial patch. CvUnit::healTurns and CvUnit::canHeal - Now handles damage and healing from plot features (thanks LunarMongoose)\r\n- EXP2: The cap on negative attitude from requesting military help from the king has been lowered to prevent players from permanently being able to buy discounted military units\r\n- EXP3: If war is declared on another European nation, the aggressor will receive a major diplomatic attitude penalty with its king as well\r\n- EXP4: To receive revolutionary support, we now require the player to be on good terms with the potential supporter's king as well\r\n- EXP5: AI players fighting the revolutionary war will no longer consider a bribe to sign peace with their king. Also they will no longer reply with the \"we'd love to, but you would have to ask them\" nonsense :P\r\n- GAME1: African slaves now have the same restrictions as native slaves with respect to allowed professions\r\n- OPT3: From K-mod: \"Made some minor efficiency improvements to CvUnitAI::AI_promote\"\r\n- OPT4: From K-mod: Disabled some obsolete BtS code.\r\n- OPT5: Adapted from K-mod. Blocked most python callbacks and recoded those who only had a python implementation in C++. The callbacks can be reenabled in XML.\r\n- OPT6: Optimized and refactored CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_tradeRoutes / CvSelectionGroupAI::AI_getYieldsLoaded. Added a helper CvSelectionGroupAI::processTradeRoute\r\n- NOCHEAT1: Slaves and prisoners may no longer found cities (XML must be updated to disallow)\r\n- ACO1: Implemented a modified version of PieceOfMind's Advanced Combat Odds modcomp for BTS that supports the limited combat rounds feature in RaR\r\n- AI14: Prevent the AI from purchasing smuggling ships when offered since it doesn't know how to put them to use\r\n- AI15: Tweak AI to produce less coastal transports and more wagons\r\n- AI16: Block AI from producing YIELD_CANNON\r\n- AI17: Restricting the UNITAIs considered by great generals / admirals\r\n- AI18: Adapted from K-mod. AI explorers will now try to make contact with mapped but unmet players. Added missing const.\r\n- AI19: By mistake I had broken CvPlayerAI::AI_needsProtection by omitting to return true when a transport needed protection.\r\n- AI20: Added isProfessionalMilitary() mainly to prevent the AI from having units with GGs attached join cities.\r\n- AI21: Prohibit the AI from ever exporting tools, blades, muskets and cannons to Europe. We can make the logic more refined in the future but for now the AI needs strict hand-holding\r\n- EVENTS3: The WHALING event is no longer recurrent since the event's logic cannot handle it correctly"}
