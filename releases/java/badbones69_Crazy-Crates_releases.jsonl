Please check the console for the error log.'`\r\n- `/cc convert` command to convert supported plugin's crate files to Crazy Crate's crate files.\r\n  - This converter will allow users to easily convert their config.yml from CratesPlus to Crazy Crate's file system. Crazy Crates does not support all the same features as CratesPlus and as such can't convert all crates and their settings perfectly.\r\n- New `/cc open <crate> [player]` command now will try and open a crate for a player if they have a key. If they do not then it will deny them and give them a little knock-back like when right-clicking a physical crate with no key. This makes it possible to use something like an NPC as a crate instead of a physical crate. Though the command will not open any physical-based crates.\r\n- Aliases for `/cc forceopen` `/cc fopen` `/cc fo`\r\n- Items: option can now use flags to add to items. Just add the flag as an option and it will add to the item.\r\n- Flags: option has been added to display items so the display items can now use flags as well.\r\n  - List of Flags: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html\r\n- Potions can now use the same color code as Leather Armor.\r\n- New Patterns: option can be used in the Display Item to display colored banners and shields.\r\n- You can now use patterns in the Items: option to give colored banners and shields to players.\r\n  - Usage: `<Pattern>:<Color>`\r\n- New Command `/cc transfer <crate> <player> [amount]` is used for transferring virtual keys from player to player.\r\n  - This can be used as a way for players to sell their virtual keys to each other.\r\n- New messages in the Messages.yml file for the new command.\r\n  - `Same-Player: '&cYou can't use this command on yourself.'`\r\n  - `Not-Enough-Keys: '&cYou do not have enough keys to transfer.'`\r\n  - `Transferred-Keys: '&7You have transferred %amount% %crate% keys to %player%.'`\r\n  - `Received-Transferred-Keys: '&7You have received %amount% %crate% keys from %player%.'`"}

There are 2 options for this. \r\n1. The color name directly.\r\n2. Use the R,G,B color code to set a specific color.\r\nExample: `- 'Item:Leather_Chestplate:Blue'` `- 'Item:Leather_Chestplate:0,0,255'`\r\n- You can now add Custom Model Data to items in the display items or prizes. If you wish to use them then you need to use a `#` instead of `:` so CC can know it is a data number. \r\nUsage: `<ID>:<Durability>#<CustomModelData>`\r\nExamples:\r\n1. `- 'Item:Wool:14#12'`\r\n2. `- 'Item:Apple#3'`\r\n- `No-Prizes-Found` message in the Messages.yml for when no prizes are found in a crate.\r\n- `PhysicalCrateKeyCheckEvent` is called when the built-in key checker for a physical crate has been called. This is used to disable the built-in check so other developers can disable it and implement their checkers for specific stuff. Canceling the event will disable the checking. This does not disable the preview opener and the menu opener on physical crates.\r\n- Close inventory automatically after 2 seconds for CSGO, Cosmic, and Roulette.\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n- Menu option was missing from the /cc set command.\r\n- Players opening a quad crate could open physical menu crates.\r\n- If there is a block where a chest spawns for a quad-crate it will disappear and not show back up at the end of the animation.\r\n- When quad-crate places the old block states back to remove its platforms it put the item type back but never added back the data for each block. This caused issues with Blocks like player heads as they would lose their skins and show as a normal skeleton head/player head.\r\n- Fixed an NPE when a player tries to open a crate with no prizes that they can win. Either the player has won all the prizes or there are none in the crate.\r\n- Fixed an NPE when trying to open a broken physical crate.\r\n- Fixed some enchantment names not being found as enchantments.\r\n- Fixed an NPE from 1.8.8 servers.\r\n- Fixed an NPE from mob eggs with no ids.\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n- Changed item ID in 1.13 default crate file."}

Removes the NBT tags from both items to see if they match each other.\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n- NPE from when keys with no names are used. 12d47ca52fbbf4f6d1d4357aae3544739c209ef5\r\n- When setting a key as just a plan item with no name or lore you could no longer use it as a key because of it checking for an nbt tag and due to how item stacks are checked. e5efaf615b7fba2cc9924b88b2cbf600b48bfb61\r\n- Being able to open an infinite amount of crates while having the key NOT in the 1st hot-bar slot. It now just checks the item in the player's hand. 4ea2f6cb9ca8095a214d3cd77756f52b3464a902\r\n- Keys not being able to open some crates. 4ea2f6cb9ca8095a214d3cd77756f52b3464a902\r\n- Using the same key for multiple crates would not work due to per crate nbt tags. 4ea2f6cb9ca8095a214d3cd77756f52b3464a902"}
