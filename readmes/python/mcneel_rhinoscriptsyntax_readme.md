RhinoPython Scripts
===================

This is the repository for the RhinoScriptSyntax.  This is a library of python scripts used by the python scripting engine in [Rhinoceros](http://www.rhino3d.com/) and [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/). For details on using python, go to [Rhino.Python including Guides, Samples and Documentation](http://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/).

Discussions for help on using these scripts can be found at: [Rhino Scripting Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/scripting)

Using the Source
----------------
You are going to need either:

* The latest Rhino5 WIP (http://www.rhino3d.com/nr.htm)
* The latest Mac Rhino WIP (http://mac.rhino3d.com/)

Start Rhino and run EditPythonScript or RunPythonScript. This will cause the python plug-in for Rhino to unpack the scripts defined in this project to your computer. Every new build of Rhino5 contains the latest version of the scripts in this project. The scripts on this site can be updated in between new versions of Rhino, permitting for new python functions without waiting for a new Rhino build. This is when you may want to get the latest changes from here.

Here are some instructions on copying the python source code from this site to your local computer.
