Eclipse Collections Kata 
========================
A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) is an exercise in martial arts. 
A [code kata](http://codekata.com/) is an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. 
The Eclipse Collections Kata is a fun way to help you learn idiomatic Eclipse Collections usage. 
This particular kata is set up as a series of unit tests which fail. 
Your task is to make them pass, using Eclipse Collections.

What you will need to build the katas
-------------------------------------
1. JDK 11
2. Maven 3.6.1+
3. IDE of your choice that has support for JDK 11

Initialize Kata
---------------
Clone this repo or simply download and extract the master [zip file](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/archive/master.zip), 
then follow the instructions below for your IDE/platform. 


### Eclipse users

You can import the project from "Import" => "General" => "Existing Projects into Workspace".
Select "eclipse-collections-kata" directory as root directory, 
make sure to choose "Search for nested projects" option and finish.
### IntelliJ IDEA users

Initialize IntelliJ IDEA project with the command below. 

You can open the project from "File" => "Open..." => choose "eclipse-collections-kata" folder.

### NetBeans users

##### Linux/Mac/Windows:

_open as a Maven project_

You can open the project directly from "File" => "Open Project..." => choose "eclipse-collections-kata" folder.
In the "Open Project" dialog you might select the option "Open Required Projects" to automatically open the two modules.

Work on Kata exercises
----------------------
There are seven separate katas under different directories:

1. [Pet Kata](pet-kata)
2. [Company Kata](company-kata)
3. [Candy Kata](candy-kata)
4. [Converter Method Kata](converter-method-kata)
5. [Top Methods Kata](top-methods-kata)
6. [Lost and Found Kata](lost-and-found-kata)
7. [Jackson Kata](jackson-kata)

To get started, you can refer to slides for the [Instruction and Pet Kata](http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/) to learn how to set-up Kata, basic features of Eclipse Collections corresponding to each Pet Kata exercise and then solutions. 
Check out the [pet kata solutions module tests](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/tree/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata) for your reference.

To learn wider range of functionalities, slides for [Company Kata](http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/company-kata) are now available online as well. 

To learn more about the Bag data structure, take a look at the [Candy Kata](candy-kata).

Check out [Lost and Found Kata](lost-and-found-kata) and [solutions](lost-and-found-kata-solutions) to learn more advanced data structures and APIs in Eclipse Collections, many of which will have no equivalent in the JDK today.

Enjoy happy learning with Eclipse Collections Kata!

Reference Guide
---------------
The [Eclipse Collections Reference Guide](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/docs/0-RefGuide.adoc) is a great way to get an overview of the extensive features available in the framework.


Presentations
-------------
The [API Design of Eclipse Collections](http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata/api-design) covers the design 
decisions that went into making Eclipse Collections and guiding its evolution from Java 4 through Java 9. 
The content of the presentation is also available in a convenient to read [markdown format](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/docs/api-design/slides.md).
