This introduces slf4j and logback as new dependencies, but it's pluggable so logback can be swapped with something else.\n- A fix to a problem about sending multi-line schemas over the wire. This introduces gson as a new dependency, but it is also pluggable, if someone wants to provide an alternate json parser lib integration.\n- New and improved unit tests, including some to ensure the current REST Server endpoints remain backwards-compatible with the original AVRO-1124 REST Client implementation.\n- New REST Client configuration for throwing exceptions when encountering errors, instead of returning nulls and empty lists.\n- A new ZooKeeper Repository backend for high-availability. This introduces zookeeper and curator as new dependencies (only when using the new schema-repo-zookeeper or schema-repo-zk-bundle artifacts). N.B.: The ZK backend is still considered experimental. Please tell us if you encounter any issues or if you would like to contribute improvements (:\n- A maven plugin for registering schemas with a remote schema repo from within your maven build. This is available via a new schema-repo-maven-plugin artifact. The code and documentation for this is in the schema-repo-tools GitHub repository.\n- Improved javadoc and documentation.\n\nAll 0.1.2 release artifacts are available in Maven Central. Please let us know if you have any trouble using them.\n\nThe contributors for this release are:\n- Felix GV\n- Ernest Mishkin\n- Johnnie Zhang\n- Lewis John McGibbney\n\nErnest Mishkin was also added as a committer on the project, thanks to his multiple contributions and code reviews.
