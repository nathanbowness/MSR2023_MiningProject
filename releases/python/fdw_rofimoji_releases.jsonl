Afterwards, the original clipboard content is restored. This is a bit involved, but it works with such fickle programs as Firefox.\r\nTo use this, start `rofimoji` with `-c` (or `--use-clipboard`) or press `Alt+p` on the selected emojis.\r\n\r\n## Annotations\r\nFinally, the search gets better as `rofimoji` now includes the official \"annotations\" to each emoji. Now you don't have to know the exact name.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nSeveral people have helped me with this release:\r\n- @vyachkonovalov \r\n- @polyzen \r\n- @The-Compiler \r\n- @nimobeeren\r\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb"}
