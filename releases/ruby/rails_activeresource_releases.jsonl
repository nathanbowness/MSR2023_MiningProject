([#95](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/95), [Pedro Nascimento](https://github.com/lunks))\n-   `ActiveResource::Collection` delegates all instance methods for `Array`.\n  ([#101](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/101), [printercu](https://github.com/printercu))\n-   Railtie enables configuration and dev reloading of observers just like\n  ActiveRecord when using Active Resource with Rails. Active Resource also now runs Active Support\n  load hooks for `:active_resource`. ([#109](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/109), [Ches Martin](https://github.com/ches))\n\n### Fixes\n-   Improvement to thread safety of headers. ([#61](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/61), [niedfelj](https://github.com/niedfelj))\n-   A `belongs_to` child with a missing parent ID returns nil for the\n  association instead of making a bogus remote call. ([#68](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/68), [Javier Saldana](https://github.com/jassa))\n-   A `has_many` association does not trigger a remote call if parent is a new\n  record. ([#97](https://github.com/rails/activeresource/pull/97), [Sasha Shamne](https://github.com/shamne))\n"}
