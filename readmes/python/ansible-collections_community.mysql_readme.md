## Using this collection

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the MySQL collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.mysql
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically if you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql:==2.0.0
```
