The Eclipse-based tooling for Ruta, called the Ruta Workbench,\r\nwas created to support the user and to facilitate every step when writing Ruta rules. Both the \r\nRuta rule language and the Ruta Workbench integrate smoothly with Apache UIMA.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature and bugfix release.\r\n\r\n## Notable changes in this release\r\n\r\n* [UIMA-6411] - Avoid creation of `RutaBasics` for bad annotations\r\n* [UIMA-6406] - Removing an annotation inside a `BLOCK` only takes effect outside the block\r\n* [UIMA-6408] - No type check of features in `TRANSFER`\r\n* [UIMA-6409] - Possible endless wildcard lookahead in combination with subtokens\r\n* [UIMA-6414] - Missing match for optional after sidestep out of composed\r\n* [UIMA-6404] - `@` with quantifier ignores matches\r\n* [UIMA-6405] - Local variable not captured properly in a wildcard matching condition.\r\n* [UIMA-6461] - Wrong argument to `contains()`\r\n* [UIMA-6399] - `RutaPatternCache` prevents `CPEEngine` from terminating\r\n* [UIMA-6383] - TRIE - Wordlist entry not annotated\r\n* [UIMA-6394] - Label assignment in alternative match causes problems\r\n\r\nA [full list of issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20UIMA%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.2.0ruta) addressed in this release can be found on issue tracker.\r\n\r\nPlease use the [mailing lists](https://uima.apache.org/mail-lists.html) for feedback and the [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/uima) to report bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported Platforms\r\n\r\nUIMA Ruta 3.2.0 should be used in combination with\r\n\r\n- Java 1.8 or higher\r\n- UIMA Java SDK 3.3.0 or higher\r\n- uimaFIT 3.3.0 or higher\r\n- Spring Framework 5.3.20 or higher\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe official release comes with verifiable signatures and hashes and can be downloaded from the Apache UIMA homepage: https://uima.apache.org/downloads.cgi\r\n\r\nNote that in particular the **Source code** links below do **not** provide official release artifacts.
