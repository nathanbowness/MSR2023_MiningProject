# Recast.AI - SDK Ruby

Recast.AI official SDK in Ruby

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/01---Analyse-text)
* [Manage a conversation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/02---Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/03---Receive-and-send-messages)

## Installation

This gem supports ruby 2.3+.

```bash
gem install RecastAI
```

You can now use the sdk in your code.

Using the entire SDK:
```ruby
require 'recastai'

client = RecastAI::Client.new('YOUR_TOKEN')

client.request.analyse_text('Hi')
client.connect.broadcast_message('Hello')
```

Extracting one single API:
```ruby
require 'recastai'

request = RecastAI::Request.new('YOUR_TOKEN')
request.analyse_text('Hi')

connect = RecastAI::Connect.new('YOUR_TOKEN')
connect.broadcast_message('Hi')
```
