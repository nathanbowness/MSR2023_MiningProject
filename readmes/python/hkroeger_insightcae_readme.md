InsightCAE
==========

InsightCAE is a workbench for Computer-Aided Engineering. Individual open source projects often meet only subtasks in analysis process. To automate repetitive computational tasks, a combination of several open source engineering software tools is often required. In order to use open source software productive and efficient for everyday tasks, the analysis automation framework InsightCAE is provided by silentdynamics.

InsightCAE serves as a framework for the implementation of analysis procedures. The objective is to provide interfaces to the tools and simulation programs that are needed for a specific computing task.
