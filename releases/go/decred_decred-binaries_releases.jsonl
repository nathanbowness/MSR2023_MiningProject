Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n\r\n<a id=\"dcrwallet-v175\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.7.5\r\n\r\nThis release includes minor fixes and improvements for the wallet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixes and new features listed below, the wallet has also been\r\nupdated to follow the TestNet3 hard fork which throttles the difficulty changes\r\nallowed as hashpower is quickly increased on the network.  This was an unvoted\r\nhard fork that only affects the test network, and all users of the test network\r\nmust upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* The SFNodeCF service flag was removed from the required services of nodes\r\n  connected to in SPV mode.  Version 2 compact filters are now required by\r\n  consensus rules and there is no service flag to identify their support.\r\n\r\n* An issue preventing the `signrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method from using\r\n  private keys in the request parameters was corrected.\r\n\r\n* The automated ticket buyer no longer attempts to mix change if the\r\n  StakeShuffle server is not specified in the application config\r\n  (`--csppserver`) or the gRPC requests that started the buyer.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The gRPC methods `VotingService.TreasuryPolicies` and\r\n  `VotingService.SetTreasuryPolicies` were added for gRPC clients to be able to\r\n  view and set the treasury voting policies of a ticket with VSPs.\r\n\r\n* An `importpubkey` JSON-RPC method was introduced to import raw secp256k1\r\n  public keys and their derived P2PKH address to the `imported` account.  This\r\n  method is only usable on watching-only wallets.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.7.2...release-v1.7.5).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Dave Collins\r\n* David Hill\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v175\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.7.5\r\n\r\nThis release is mainly due to a critical fix that was included in DEX 0.5.4.  \r\n\r\nThere are other small bug fixes and improvements included as well.\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix never ending loading button on Treasury Spending tab.\r\n\r\n* Add Ticket Spent entry to the Revocation tx details page.\r\n\r\n* Fix placeholder size in TextInput\r\n\r\n* Rename cspp to StakeShuffle throughout.\r\n\r\n* Refresh DEX window with F5 key now working as expected.\r\n\r\n* Add testnet PiKeys on testnet for treasury spending tab.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.7.3...release-v1.7.5).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- bgptr\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow (@chappjc)\r\n\r\n<a id=\"downloads-v175\" />", "mentions_count": 1}

id=\"dcrwallet-v172\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.7.2\r\n\r\nThis release updates the wallet in light of the activation of DCP0009 on all Decred networks, as well as providing various other fixes.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* All ticket revoking functionality has been removed or disabled due to the activation of DCP0009 which modified consensus rules to require miners to include revocations for new expired or missed tickets.  The wallet will no longer log warnings and errors due to revocations being created in response to  missed tickets, and all RPCs which manually revoked tickets have been deprecated and no longer perform any action.  Old unspent tickets will be revoked by project members, eliminating the need for the wallet to ever create a revocation of its own.\r\n\r\n* The `verifymessage` JSON-RPC method and `MessageVerificationService.VerifyMessage` gRPC method were corrected to return success when the message is validly signed by the keys associated with a P2PKH address.  P2PK addresses are no longer valid inputs and an appropriate error will be returned if one is used.\r\n\r\n* The `walletpubpassphrasechange` JSON-RPC method was enabled.  This method was already implemented but the method was not exposed in the RPC API.\r\n\r\n* Some options in the sample configuration were rewritten to move comments that described various options to their own lines.  This prevents parsing and/or runtime errors if an option was uncommented due to the configuration not ignoring comments that do not begin at the start of a line.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.GetTicket` gRPC method now provides the VSP host associated with a ticket.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.7.1...release-v1.7.2).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Dave Collins\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v172\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.7.2\r\n\r\nThis Decrediton release includes various bug fixes for issues found during v1.7.1 usage.  DCRDEX has been updated to 0.4.3.  We have also added a few new features that should improve usage before the next big release.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix 'account not found' error when registering for DCRDEX.  There was a corner case that could be triggered due to using an incorrect password when creating a DEX account.\r\n\r\n* Launcher now allows for completion of wallets that had not completed their creation steps.\r\n\r\n* Improved performance of Transaction/Ticket history pages.  Better scroll and saving previous place where they were viewing.\r\n\r\n* Automatically set the 'per-account encryption' during wallet creation since the passphrase is available.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Ticket transaction details now show their associated VSP Host and a button that allows for the user to check the tickets' status at that VSP.  \r\n\r\n* Due to the recent network upgrade, we've removed all of the Revoke buttons.\r\n\r\n* We've removed DEX login step once the user has successfully launched the DEX window for the first time.  \r\n\r\n* Add Treasury Spending tab on the Governance Page.  This allows for stakeholders to approve or deny the public keys that sign the tspends.  \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.7.1...release-v1.7.2).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- Amir Massarwa\r\n- bgptr\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"downloads-v172\" />\r\n"}

users.\r\n \r\n## Bug fixes\r\n \r\n* The `setvotechoice` JSON-RPC method, when setting a vote choice for a particular ticket, will use the VSP recorded with the ticket from the database rather than using the VSP in the current application configuration.\r\n \r\n* An issue where vote choices were sometimes not communicated with the VSP for all unexpired tickets was corrected.\r\n \r\n* The `settreasurypolicy` and `settspendpolicy` JSON-RPC methods now validate that the length of a ticket hash is exactly 32 bytes.\r\n \r\n## Changelog\r\n \r\nAll commits since the last release may be

dcrd.  Some of the key highlights are:\r\n\r\n* Four new consensus vote agendas which allow stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate support for the following:\r\n  * Reverting the Treasury maximum expenditure policy\r\n  * Enforcing explicit version upgrades\r\n  * Support for automatic ticket revocations for missed votes\r\n  * Changing the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake subsidy split from 60%/30% to 10%/80%\r\n* Substantially reduced initial sync time\r\n* Major performance enhancements to unspent transaction output handling\r\n* Faster cryptographic signature validation\r\n* Significant improvements to network synchronization\r\n* Support for a configurable assumed valid block\r\n* Block index memory usage reduction\r\n* Asynchronous indexing\r\n* Version 1 block filters removal\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server:\r\n  * Additional per-connection read limits\r\n  * A more strict cross origin request policy\r\n  * A new alternative client authentication mechanism based on TLS certificates\r\n  * Availability of the scripting language version for transaction outputs\r\n  * Several other notable updates, additions, and removals related to the JSON-RPC API\r\n* New developer modules:\r\n  * Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters\r\n  * Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers\r\n  * Standard Scripts\r\n  * Standard Addresses\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the [voting process](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/) in Decred, all code needed in order to support each of the aforementioned consensus changes is already included in this release, however it will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the consensus change work for each of the four changes was originally proposed and approved for initial implementation via the following Politeia proposals:\r\n- [Decentralized Treasury Spending](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a)\r\n- [Explicit Version Upgrades Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)\r\n- [Automatic Ticket Revocations Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)\r\n- [Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split From 60/30 to 10/80](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposals (DCPs) describe the proposed changes in detail and provide full technical specifications:\r\n- [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Required\r\n\r\n**It is extremely important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.  This particularly applies to PoW miners as failure to upgrade will result in lost rewards after block height 635775.  That is estimated to be around Feb 21st, 2022.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.7.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous versions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the database and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\nThe database migration typically takes around 40-50 minutes on HDDs and 20-30 minutes on SSDs.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Four New Consensus Change Votes\r\n\r\nFour new consensus change votes are now available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet.\r\n\r\n#### Revert Treasury Maximum Expenditure Policy Vote\r\n\r\nThe first new vote available as of this release has the id `reverttreasurypolicy`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to revert the currently active maximum expenditure policy of the decentralized Treasury to the one specified in the [original Politeia proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a).\r\n\r\nSee [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) for the full technical specification.\r\n\r\n#### Explicit Version Upgrades Vote\r\n\r\nThe second new vote available as of this release has the id `explicitverupgrades`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this change are to:\r\n\r\n* Provide an easy, reliable, and efficient method for software and hardware to determine exactly which rules should be applied to transaction and script versions\r\n* Further embrace the increased security and other desirable properties that hard forks provide over soft forks\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)\r\n* [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n#### Automatic Ticket Revocations Vote\r\n\r\nThe third new vote available as of this release has the id `autorevocations`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this change are to:\r\n\r\n* Improve the Decred stakeholder user experience by removing the requirement for stakeholders to manually revoke missed and expired tickets\r\n* Enable the recovery of funds for users who lost their redeem script for the legacy VSP system (before the release of vspd, which removed the need for the redeem script)\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)\r\n* [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n#### Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80 Vote\r\n\r\nThe fourth new vote available as of this release has the id `changesubsidysplit`.\r\n\r\nThe proposed modification to the subsidy split is intended to substantially diminish the ability to attack Decred's markets with mined coins and improve decentralization of the issuance process.\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)\r\n* [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n### Substantially Reduced Initial Sync Time\r\n\r\nThe amount of time it takes to complete the initial chain synchronization process has been substantially reduced.  With default settings, it is around 48% faster versus the previous release.\r\n\r\n### Unspent Transaction Output Overhaul\r\n\r\nThe way unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are handled has been significantly reworked to provide major performance enhancements to both steady-state operation as well as the initial chain sync process as follows:\r\n\r\n* Each UTXO is now tracked independently on a per-output basis\r\n* The UTXOs now reside in a dedicated database\r\n* All UTXO reads and writes now make use of a cache\r\n\r\n#### Unspent Transaction Output Cache\r\n\r\nAll reads and writes of unspent transaction outputs (utxos) now go through a cache that sits on top of the utxo set database which drastically reduces the amount of reading and writing to disk, especially during the initial sync process when a very large number of blocks are being processed in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThis utxo cache provides significant runtime performance benefits at the cost of some additional memory usage.  The maximum size of the cache can be configured with the new `--utxocachemaxsize` command-line configuration option.  The default value is 150 MiB, the minimum value is 25 MiB, and the maximum value is 32768 MiB (32 GiB).\r\n\r\nSome key properties of the cache are as follows:\r\n\r\n* For reads, the UTXO cache acts as a read-through cache\r\n  * All UTXO reads go through the cache\r\n  * Cache misses load the missing data from the disk and cache it for future lookups\r\n* For writes, the UTXO cache acts as a write-back cache\r\n  * Writes to the cache are acknowledged by the cache immediately, but are only periodically flushed to disk\r\n* Allows intermediate steps to effectively be skipped thereby avoiding the need to write millions of entries to disk\r\n* On average, recent UTXOs are much more likely to be spent in upcoming blocks than older UTXOs, so only the oldest UTXOs are evicted as needed in order to maximize the hit ratio of the cache\r\n* The cache is periodically flushed with conditional eviction:\r\n  * When the cache is NOT full, nothing is evicted, but the changes are still written to the disk set to allow for a quicker reconciliation in the case of an unclean shutdown\r\n  * When the cache is full, 15% of the oldest UTXOs are evicted\r\n\r\n### Faster Cryptographic Signature Validation\r\n\r\nSome aspects of the underlying crypto code has been updated to further improve its execution speed and reduce the number of memory allocations resulting in about a 1% reduction to signature verification time.\r\n\r\nThe primary benefits are:\r\n\r\n* Improved vote times since blocks and transactions propagate more quickly throughout the network\r\n* Approximately a 2% reduction to the duration of the initial sync process\r\n\r\n### Significant Improvements to Network Synchronization\r\n\r\nThe method used to obtain blocks from other peers on the network is now guided entirely by block headers.  This provides a wide variety of benefits, but the most notable ones for most users are:\r\n\r\n* Faster initial synchronization\r\n* Reduced bandwidth usage\r\n* Enhanced protection against attempted DoS attacks\r\n* Percentage-based progress reporting\r\n* Improved steady state logging\r\n\r\n### Support for Configurable Assumed Valid Block\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new model for deciding when several historical validation checks may be skipped for blocks that are an ancestor of a known good block.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a new `AssumeValid` parameter is now used to specify the aforementioned known good block.  The default value of the parameter is updated with each release to a recent block that is part of the main chain.\r\n\r\nThe default value of the parameter can be overridden with the `--assumevalid` command-line option by setting it as follows:\r\n\r\n* `--assumevalid=0`: Disable the feature resulting in no skipped validation checks\r\n* `--assumevalid=[blockhash]`:  Set `AssumeValid` to the specified block hash\r\n\r\nSpecifying a block hash closer to the current best chain tip allows for faster syncing.  This is useful since the validation requirements increase the longer a particular release build is out as the default known good block becomes deeper in the chain.\r\n\r\n### Block Index Memory Usage Reduction\r\n\r\nThe block index that keeps track of block status and connectivity now occupies around 30MiB less memory and scales better as more blocks are added to the chain.\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous Indexing\r\n\r\nThe various optional indexes are now created asynchronously versus when blocks are processed as was previously the case.\r\n\r\nThis permits blocks to be validated more quickly when the indexes are enabled since the validation no longer needs to wait for the indexing operations to complete.\r\n\r\nIn order to help keep consistent behavior for RPC clients, RPCs that involve interacting with the indexes will not return results until the associated indexing operation completes when the indexing tip is close to the current best chain tip.\r\n\r\nOne side effect of this change that RPC clients should be aware of is that it is now possible to receive sync timeout errors on RPCs that involve interacting with the indexes if the associated indexing tip gets so far behind it would end up delaying results for too long.  In practice, errors of this type are rare and should only ever be observed during the initial sync process before the associated indexes are current.  However, callers should be aware of the possibility and handle the error accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe following RPCs are affected:\r\n\r\n* `existsaddress`\r\n* `existsaddresses`\r\n* `getrawtransaction`\r\n* `searchrawtransactions`\r\n\r\n### Version 1 Block Filters Removal\r\n\r\nThe previously deprecated version 1 block filters are no longer available on the peer-to-peer network.  Use [version 2 block filters](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters) with their associated [block header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-header-commitments) and [inclusion proof](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#verifying-commitment-root-inclusion-proofs) instead.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\nThe RPC server version as of this release is 7.0.0.\r\n\r\n#### Max Request Limits\r\n\r\nThe RPC server now imposes the following additional per-connection read limits to help further harden it against potential abuse in non-standard configurations on poorly-configured networks:\r\n\r\n* 0 B / 8 MiB for pre and post auth HTTP connections\r\n* 4 KiB / 16 MiB for pre and post auth WebSocket connections\r\n\r\nIn practice, these changes will not have any noticeable effect for the vast majority of nodes since the RPC server is not publicly accessible by default and also requires authentication.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it can still be useful for scenarios such as authenticated fuzz testing and improperly-configured networks that have disabled all other security measures.\r\n\r\n#### More Strict Cross Origin Request (CORS) Policy\r\n\r\nThe CORS policy for WebSocket clients is now more strict and rejects requests from other domains.\r\n\r\nIn practice, CORS requests will be rejected before ever reaching that point due to the use of a self-signed TLS certificate and the requirement for\r\nauthentication to issue any commands.  However, additional protection mechanisms make it that much more difficult to attack by providing defense in depth.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Client Authentication Method Based on TLS Certificates\r\n\r\nA new alternative method for TLS clients to authenticate to the RPC server by presenting a client certificate in the TLS handshake is now available.\r\n\r\nUnder this authentication method, the certificate authority for a client certificate must be added to the RPC server as a trusted root in order for it to trust the client.  Once activated, clients will no longer be required to provide HTTP Basic authentication nor use the `authenticate` RPC in the case of WebSocket clients.\r\n\r\nNote that while TLS client authentication has the potential to ultimately allow more fine grained access controls on a per-client basis, it currently only supports clients with full administrative privileges.  In other words, it is not currently compatible with the `--rpclimituser` and `--rpclimitpass` mechanism, so users depending on the limited user settings should avoid the new authentication method for now.\r\n\r\nThe new authentication type can be activated with the `--authtype=clientcert` configuration option.\r\n\r\nBy default, the trusted roots are loaded from the `clients.pem` file in dcrd's application data directory, however, that location can be modified via the `--clientcafile` option if desired.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Transaction Output Query RPC (`gettxout`)\r\n\r\nThe `gettxout` RPC has the following modifications:\r\n\r\n* An additional `tree` parameter is now required in order to explicitly identify the exact transaction output being requested\r\n* The transaction `version` field is no longer available in the primary JSON object of the results\r\n* The child `scriptPubKey` JSON object in the results now includes a new `version` field that identifies the scripting language version\r\n\r\nSee the [gettxout JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettxout) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Stake Difficulty Notification RPCs (`notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty` WebSocket-only RPCs are no longer available.  This notification is unnecessary since the difficulty change interval is well defined.  Callers may obtain the difficulty via `getstakedifficulty` at the appropriate difficulty change intervals instead.\r\n\r\nSee the [getstakedifficulty JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getstakedifficulty) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Version 1 Filter RPCs (`getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader` RPCs, which were previously used to obtain version 1 block filters via RPC are no longer available. Use `getcfilterv2` instead.\r\n\r\nSee the [getcfilterv2 JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getcfilterv2) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Median Time Field on Block Query RPCs (`getblock` and `getblockheader`)\r\n\r\nThe verbose results of the `getblock` and `getblockheader` RPCs now include a `mediantime` field that specifies the median block time associated with the block.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)\r\n* [getblockheader JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblockheader)\r\n\r\n#### New Scripting Language Version Field on Raw Transaction RPCs (`getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock`)\r\n\r\nThe verbose results of the `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock` RPCs now include a `version` field in the child `scriptPubKey` JSON object that identifies the scripting language version.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [getrawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawtransaction)\r\n* [decoderawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#decoderawtransaction)\r\n* [searchrawtransactions JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#searchrawtransactions)\r\n* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Add Transaction Filter on Mempool Query RPC (`getrawmempool`)\r\n\r\nThe transaction type parameter of the `getrawmempool` RPC now accepts `tadd` to only include treasury add transactions in the results.\r\n\r\nSee the [getrawmempool JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawmempool) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Manual Block Invalidation and Reconsideration RPCs (`invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock`)\r\n\r\nA new pair of RPCs named `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` are now available.  These RPCs can be used to manually invalidate a block as if it had violated consensus rules and reconsider a block for validation and best chain selection by removing any invalid status from it and its ancestors, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis capability is provided for development, testing, and debugging.  It can be particularly useful when developing services that build on top of Decred to more easily ensure edge conditions associated with invalid blocks and chain reorganization are being handled properly.\r\n\r\nThese RPCs do not apply to regular users and can safely be ignored outside of development.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [invalidateblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#invalidateblock)\r\n* [reconsiderblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#reconsiderblock)\r\n\r\n### Reject Protocol Message Deprecated (`reject`)\r\n\r\nThe `reject` peer-to-peer protocol message is now deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\nThis message is a holdover from the original codebase where it was required, but it really is not a useful message and has several downsides:\r\n\r\n* Nodes on the network must be trustless, which means anything relying on such a message is setting itself up for failure because nodes are not obligated to send it at all nor be truthful as to the reason\r\n* It can be harmful to privacy as it allows additional node fingerprinting\r\n* It can lead to security issues for implementations that don't handle it with proper sanitization practices\r\n* It can easily give software implementations the fully incorrect impression that it can be relied on for determining if transactions and blocks are valid\r\n* The only way it is actually used currently is to show a debug log message, however, all of that information is already available via the peer and/or wire logging anyway\r\n* It carries a non-trivial amount of development overhead to continue to support it when nothing actually uses it\r\n\r\n### No DNS Seeds Command-Line Option Deprecated (`--nodnsseed`)\r\n\r\nThe `--nodnsseed` command-line configuration option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Use `--noseeders` instead.\r\n\r\nDNS seeding has not been used since the previous release.\r\n\r\n## Notable New Developer Modules\r\n\r\n### Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters \r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf` module is now available that provides Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters (APBFs).\r\n\r\nAn APBF is a probabilistic lookup device that can quickly determine if it contains an element.  It permits tracking large amounts of data while using very little memory at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives.  Unlike classic Bloom filters, it is able to handle an unbounded amount of data by aging and discarding old items.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example of actual savings achieved in Decred by making use of an APBF, the memory to track addresses known by 125 peers was reduced from ~200 MiB to ~5 MiB.\r\n\r\nSee the [apbf module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf) for full details on usage, accuracy under workloads, expected memory usage, and performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256` module is now available that provides highly optimized allocation free fixed precision unsigned 256-bit integer arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThe package has a strong focus on performance and correctness and features arithmetic, boolean comparison, bitwise logic, bitwise shifts, conversion to/from relevant types, and full formatting support - all served with an ergonomic API, full test coverage, and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nEvery operation is faster than the standard library `big.Int` equivalent and the primary math operations provide reductions of over 90% in the calculation time. Most other operations are also significantly faster.\r\n\r\nSee the [uint256 module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256) for full details on usage, including a categorized summary, and performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Standard Scripts\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript` package is now available that provides facilities for identifying and extracting data from transaction scripts that are considered standard by the default policy of most nodes.\r\n\r\nThe package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.\r\n\r\nSee the [stdscript package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript) for full details on usage and a list of the recognized standard scripts.\r\n\r\n### Standard Addresses\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr` package is now available that provides facilities for working with human-readable Decred payment addresses.\r\n\r\nThe package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.\r\n\r\nSee the [stdaddr package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr) for full details on usage and a list of the supported addresses.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 877 commits from 16 contributors which total to 492 files changed, 77937 additional lines of code, and 30961 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.6.0...release-v1.7.0).\r\n\r\nSee the [dcrd's own release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.7.0) for a categorized breakdown of all commits since the last release.\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- briancolecoinmetrics\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- David Hill\r\n- degeri\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku\r\n- J Fixby\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- Joe Gruffins\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- lolandhold\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Naveen\r\n- Ryan Staudt\r\n- Youssef Boukenken\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"dcrwallet-v170\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.7.0\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on implementing a mixing protocol change to add additional post-quantum security in the key exchanges, improvements to VSP ticketbuying, and adding support for current dcrd consensus agendas.\r\n\r\nThis prerelease software contains a database upgrade.  Testers are advised to backup their wallet databases before upgrading.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Mixing support now uses a different, incompatible protocol for extra security.  Users of the cspp.decred.org mix server are advised to updated their configurations to use mix.decred.org.  A new server certificate will need to be downloaded as well.\r\n* New JSON-RPC methods (`settreasurypolicy`, `settspendpolicy`, `treasurypolicy`, `tspendpolicy`) were added to control the approval policy of treasury expenditure transactions.  Policies are set on a per-key basis with overriding policies for particular transaction hashes.\r\n* The `purchaseticket` JSON-RPC method now respects mixing configurations and will buy mixed tickets when these settings are used.\r\n* A `mixsplitlimit` config option was added to control how many concurrent connections may be made to the mixer server for a given output value for account and change mixing.\r\n* The `walletinfo` JSON-RPC method now returns whether the wallet is in SPV mode or not.\r\n* The `validateaddress` JSON-RPC and `WalletService.ValidateAddress` gRPC methods now include additional wallet information for decoded wallet address, including the account and branch paths.\r\n* It is now possible to import extended xpriv accounts that are derived from arbitrary seeds.  This is intended for importing accounts for voting and is performed with the `WalletService.ImportVotingAccountFromSeed` gRPC method.\r\n* The `getblock`, `getblockheader`, `getcfilterv2`, `getcurrentnet` `gettxout`, and JSON-RPC methods are now supported under SPV mode.\r\n* The median time is now included reported by the `getblock` JSON-RPC response.\r\n* The `WalletService.DiscoverUsage` gRPC method was added to force address and account discovery.\r\n* The `WalletService.ImportExtendedPublicKey` gRPC method was added to import xpubs as accounts (providing the same functionality as the `importxpub` JSON-RPC method).\r\n* Ticket tracking in the database now records which VSP (if any) a ticket was  purchased for.  This allows the VSP client to check the status of previously-bought tickets without the polling every VSP for the ticket info. VSP tickets will also processed even if no current VSP is configured in the current application settings.\r\n* The `ticketbuyer.limit` option now defaults to 1.\r\n* A `logsize` config option was added to control how large log files may become before they are rotated and compressed.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* The wallet no longer attempts to perform votes or revocations if the wallet only has an imported address or pubkey but no private key to sign the transaction inputs.\r\n* The `ticketbuyer.limit` config option now controls how many separate connections are made to the mix server with distinct groups of transaction inputs to mix.  This reduces mix correlation of larger sets of inputs with their change output.\r\n* The `WalletService.Accounts` gRPC method response now contains the last returned account indexes rather than the total number of keys in an account, which more accurately reflects account usage due to how the gap limit is internally handled by the wallet.\r\n* A bug negatively affecting performance and memory usage related to address watching was corrected.\r\n* Several issues preventing blockchain reorganization from being handled correctly in SPV mode were fixed.\r\n* Several deadlocks in the SPV implementation mode were corrected.\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation for multisig transactions was improved.\r\n* Data races were corrected.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.6.3...release-v1.7.0).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* David Hill\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* JoeGruffins\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n* Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v170\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.7.0\r\n\r\nThis release of Decrediton includes numerous bug fixes and refinement across all pages/tabs.  \r\n\r\nWe have overhauled the security of Decrediton so that we can keep using electron in the future, with a decent amount of assurance that it's\r\nsafe and not prone to intrusion.  The overal gist of the work done could be described simply as: layer/context isolation.  We reduced the total number of dependencies as well as the access those dependencies may have to private information.  Users will be shown some new modals while confirming wallet seeds and confirming destination addresses.\r\n\r\nDCRDEX is now at 0.4.0 and considered to be fully integrated with Decrediton.  Some extra work has been done to improve bitcoin config handling and overall stability of new DEX account creation.  Users are now able to restore their DEX accounts with a seed from their DCRDEX windows.  This should help users avoid  paying fees to trading servers unnecessarily. There are a few remaining features that will be added in the future (dcrwallet SPV and ETH support), but overall is  feature complete in terms of decrediton pieces.\r\n\r\nWe have begun to implement redesigns to some areas of decrediton.  The Governance and LN pages got full redesigns.  Changes were also made to the confirm seed view screen.  There will be more of these redesigns implemented in the near future: Settings and Launcher (wallet selection) coming up next!\r\n\r\nWe have also added test coverage to all of the tabs on the Transactions page.  Ideally, as we increase test coverage we will avoid bugs caused by regressions or oversight.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have begun the process of using our react component library: pi-ui.  Things like text inputs, paginators, toggles, radio buttons are now from pi-ui.  Centralizing these components should streamline the look and feel across many Decred products (politeia, cms, decrediton).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* We have added a few new tools that will hopefully reduce the amount of support requests that are commonly issued.  First, when restoring a wallet from seed users are now given the option to 'disable coin type upgrades' which will allow older wallet (pre-2017) to be restored on the previous coin type.  We have also added a 'gap limit' setting when restoring, this should help avoid  address indexes being not correctly synced which could result in incorrect balances being shown.  Note: If the gap limit is changed on restore, then that gap limit will be used for that wallet from then on.  \r\n\r\n  For wallets that have already been restored that may have incorrect address indices, we have replaced the Gap Limit in settings with a 'discover usage' tool.  This will allow users to properly determine their address indices and balances.\r\n\r\n* We have added the ability to revoke tickets while in SPV mode.  This seems to be a common request in support.  The new 'revoke ticket' button is found in the transaction details for any non-spent ticket.  Users will be presented with a confirmation modal that informs them of the risk of attempting to revoke before that confirm that the ticket is missed on dcrdata.  (They would have to Abandon the 'bad' revocation transaction and rescan.)\r\n\r\n* We have decided to hide the legacy ticket purchase area.  We will wait until a later date to remove the components and code itself, but after 1.7.0 users will only be able to purchase private/acccount-less tickets.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issues with the Sync VSP Tickets dropdown\r\n* Various fixes for Trezor wallets.\r\n* VSPD ticket processing has been fixed and revamped.  A new status of  'confirmed' has been added.  This should reduce the number of misses that some users have encountered during the changeover from legacy ticket purchasing.\r\n* Fix issue that caused large input transactions (eg PoW mining payouts) to crash decrediton.  These transactions caused large numbers of addresses to be validated within dcrwallet which lead to resource exhaustion.  \r\n* Make sure that the unmixed account was unlocked when using the ticket autobuyer.  This could cause funds not to be spent during auto-buying.  We never had any reports of this, so unsure of the overall usage of autobuyer in general.\r\n* Fix duplicate ticket transactions being shown in the Ticket History.  Each are now labeled appropriately (eg Vote, Voted, Revoke, Revoked)\r\n* Add insufficient balance check for the account mixer.  Previously the mixer could be started even if there was no balance to mix.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.6.3...release-v1.7.0).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* Amir Massarwa\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Degeri\r\n* Guilherme Marques\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* Joe Gruffins\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Jonathan Zeppettini\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n\r\n<a id=\"downloads-v170\" />"}

and improvements from v1.7.0-rc2.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* The mixing protocol was fixed to operate properly on both 32 and 64-bit hardware.  This fix necessitated a breaking protocol change.  All users of v1.7.0-rc1 and v1.7.0-rc2 must upgrade to continue mixing.\r\n* DCP0010 activation is detected when running in RPC syncing mode and will produce votes with the proper subsidy value.\r\n* The `walletinfo` JSON-RPC method now produces more reliable results when neither the SPV nor RPC syncers have been associated with the wallet.\r\n* A received `verack` message is no longer required in SPV mode.  This fixes several P2P connection issues caused by dcrd sometimes sending other messages before the `verack`.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.7.0-rc2...release-v1.7.0-rc3).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v170-rc3\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.7.0-rc3\r\n\r\nThis release includes bug fixes and improvements from v1.7.0-rc2.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix proper on-chain agendas being shown in Governance.\r\n* Improve dex page styling\r\n* Add Italian translations\r\n* Improve Dex Window functionality\r\n* Fix a possible cause of mixing wallet slowness.\r\n* Add dcrd upgrade check\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.7.0-rc2...release-v1.7.0-rc3).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom Piatt\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"downloads-v170-rc3\" />\r\n"}

major release of dcrd.  Some of the key highlights are:\r\n\r\n* Four new consensus vote agendas which allow stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate support for the following:\r\n  * Reverting the Treasury maximum expenditure policy\r\n  * Enforcing explicit version upgrades\r\n  * Support for automatic ticket revocations for missed votes\r\n  * Changing the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake subsidy split from 60%/30% to 10%/80%\r\n* Substantially reduced initial sync time\r\n* Major performance enhancements to unspent transaction output handling\r\n* Faster cryptographic signature validation\r\n* Significant improvements to network synchronization\r\n* Support for a configurable assumed valid block\r\n* Block index memory usage reduction\r\n* Asynchronous indexing\r\n* Version 1 block filters removal\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server:\r\n  * Additional per-connection read limits\r\n  * A more strict cross origin request policy\r\n  * A new alternative client authentication mechanism based on TLS certificates\r\n  * Availability of the scripting language version for transaction outputs\r\n  * Several other notable updates, additions, and removals related to the JSON-RPC API\r\n* New developer modules:\r\n  * Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters\r\n  * Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers\r\n  * Standard Scripts\r\n  * Standard Addresses\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the [voting process](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/) in Decred, all code needed in order to support each of the aforementioned consensus changes is already included in this release, however it will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the consensus change work for each of the four changes was originally proposed and approved for initial implementation via the following Politeia proposals:\r\n- [Decentralized Treasury Spending](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a)\r\n- [Explicit Version Upgrades Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)\r\n- [Automatic Ticket Revocations Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)\r\n- [Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split From 60/30 to 10/80](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposals (DCPs) describe the proposed changes in detail and provide full technical specifications:\r\n- [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.7.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous versions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the database and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\nThe database migration typically takes around 40-50 minutes on HDDs and 20-30 minutes on SSDs.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Four New Consensus Change Votes\r\n\r\nFour new consensus change votes are now available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet.\r\n\r\n#### Revert Treasury Maximum Expenditure Policy Vote\r\n\r\nThe first new vote available as of this release has the id `reverttreasurypolicy`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to revert the currently active maximum expenditure policy of the decentralized Treasury to the one specified in the [original Politeia proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a).\r\n\r\nSee [DCP0007](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0007/dcp-0007.mediawiki) for the full technical specification.\r\n\r\n#### Explicit Version Upgrades Vote\r\n\r\nThe second new vote available as of this release has the id `explicitverupgrades`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this change are to:\r\n\r\n* Provide an easy, reliable, and efficient method for software and hardware to determine exactly which rules should be applied to transaction and script versions\r\n* Further embrace the increased security and other desirable properties that hard forks provide over soft forks\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/3a98861)\r\n* [DCP0008](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0008/dcp-0008.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n#### Automatic Ticket Revocations Vote\r\n\r\nThe third new vote available as of this release has the id `autorevocations`.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this change are to:\r\n\r\n* Improve the Decred stakeholder user experience by removing the requirement for stakeholders to manually revoke missed and expired tickets\r\n* Enable the recovery of funds for users who lost their redeem script for the legacy VSP system (before the release of vspd, which removed the need for the redeem script)\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/e2d7b7d)\r\n* [DCP0009](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0009/dcp-0009.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n#### Change PoW/PoS Subsidy Split to 10/80 Vote\r\n\r\nThe fourth new vote available as of this release has the id `changesubsidysplit`.\r\n\r\nThe proposed modification to the subsidy split is intended to substantially diminish the ability to attack Decred's markets with mined coins and improve decentralization of the issuance process.\r\n\r\nSee the following for more details:\r\n\r\n* [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/427e1d4)\r\n* [DCP0010](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0010/dcp-0010.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n### Substantially Reduced Initial Sync Time\r\n\r\nThe amount of time it takes to complete the initial chain synchronization process has been substantially reduced.  With default settings, it is around 48% faster versus the previous release.\r\n\r\n### Unspent Transaction Output Overhaul\r\n\r\nThe way unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are handled has been significantly reworked to provide major performance enhancements to both steady-state operation as well as the initial chain sync process as follows:\r\n\r\n* Each UTXO is now tracked independently on a per-output basis\r\n* The UTXOs now reside in a dedicated database\r\n* All UTXO reads and writes now make use of a cache\r\n\r\n#### Unspent Transaction Output Cache\r\n\r\nAll reads and writes of unspent transaction outputs (utxos) now go through a cache that sits on top of the utxo set database which drastically reduces the amount of reading and writing to disk, especially during the initial sync process when a very large number of blocks are being processed in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThis utxo cache provides significant runtime performance benefits at the cost of some additional memory usage.  The maximum size of the cache can be configured with the new `--utxocachemaxsize` command-line configuration option.  The default value is 150 MiB, the minimum value is 25 MiB, and the maximum value is 32768 MiB (32 GiB).\r\n\r\nSome key properties of the cache are as follows:\r\n\r\n* For reads, the UTXO cache acts as a read-through cache\r\n  * All UTXO reads go through the cache\r\n  * Cache misses load the missing data from the disk and cache it for future lookups\r\n* For writes, the UTXO cache acts as a write-back cache\r\n  * Writes to the cache are acknowledged by the cache immediately, but are only periodically flushed to disk\r\n* Allows intermediate steps to effectively be skipped thereby avoiding the need to write millions of entries to disk\r\n* On average, recent UTXOs are much more likely to be spent in upcoming blocks than older UTXOs, so only the oldest UTXOs are evicted as needed in order to maximize the hit ratio of the cache\r\n* The cache is periodically flushed with conditional eviction:\r\n  * When the cache is NOT full, nothing is evicted, but the changes are still written to the disk set to allow for a quicker reconciliation in the case of an unclean shutdown\r\n  * When the cache is full, 15% of the oldest UTXOs are evicted\r\n\r\n### Faster Cryptographic Signature Validation\r\n\r\nSome aspects of the underlying crypto code has been updated to further improve its execution speed and reduce the number of memory allocations resulting in about a 1% reduction to signature verification time.\r\n\r\nThe primary benefits are:\r\n\r\n* Improved vote times since blocks and transactions propagate more quickly throughout the network\r\n* Approximately a 2% reduction to the duration of the initial sync process\r\n\r\n### Significant Improvements to Network Synchronization\r\n\r\nThe method used to obtain blocks from other peers on the network is now guided entirely by block headers.  This provides a wide variety of benefits, but the most notable ones for most users are:\r\n\r\n* Faster initial synchronization\r\n* Reduced bandwidth usage\r\n* Enhanced protection against attempted DoS attacks\r\n* Percentage-based progress reporting\r\n* Improved steady state logging\r\n\r\n### Support for Configurable Assumed Valid Block\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new model for deciding when several historical validation checks may be skipped for blocks that are an ancestor of a known good block.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a new `AssumeValid` parameter is now used to specify the aforementioned known good block.  The default value of the parameter is updated with each release to a recent block that is part of the main chain.\r\n\r\nThe default value of the parameter can be overridden with the `--assumevalid` command-line option by setting it as follows:\r\n\r\n* `--assumevalid=0`: Disable the feature resulting in no skipped validation checks\r\n* `--assumevalid=[blockhash]`:  Set `AssumeValid` to the specified block hash\r\n\r\nSpecifying a block hash closer to the current best chain tip allows for faster syncing.  This is useful since the validation requirements increase the longer a particular release build is out as the default known good block becomes deeper in the chain.\r\n\r\n### Block Index Memory Usage Reduction\r\n\r\nThe block index that keeps track of block status and connectivity now occupies around 30MiB less memory and scales better as more blocks are added to the chain.\r\n\r\n### Asynchronous Indexing\r\n\r\nThe various optional indexes are now created asynchronously versus when blocks are processed as was previously the case.\r\n\r\nThis permits blocks to be validated more quickly when the indexes are enabled since the validation no longer needs to wait for the indexing operations to complete.\r\n\r\nIn order to help keep consistent behavior for RPC clients, RPCs that involve interacting with the indexes will not return results until the associated indexing operation completes when the indexing tip is close to the current best chain tip.\r\n\r\nOne side effect of this change that RPC clients should be aware of is that it is now possible to receive sync timeout errors on RPCs that involve interacting with the indexes if the associated indexing tip gets so far behind it would end up delaying results for too long.  In practice, errors of this type are rare and should only ever be observed during the initial sync process before the associated indexes are current.  However, callers should be aware of the possibility and handle the error accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe following RPCs are affected:\r\n\r\n* `existsaddress`\r\n* `existsaddresses`\r\n* `getrawtransaction`\r\n* `searchrawtransactions`\r\n\r\n### Version 1 Block Filters Removal\r\n\r\nThe previously deprecated version 1 block filters are no longer available on the peer-to-peer network.  Use [version 2 block filters](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters) with their associated [block header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-header-commitments) and [inclusion proof](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#verifying-commitment-root-inclusion-proofs) instead.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\nThe RPC server version as of this release is 7.0.0.\r\n\r\n#### Max Request Limits\r\n\r\nThe RPC server now imposes the following additional per-connection read limits to help further harden it against potential abuse in non-standard configurations on poorly-configured networks:\r\n\r\n* 0 B / 8 MiB for pre and post auth HTTP connections\r\n* 4 KiB / 16 MiB for pre and post auth WebSocket connections\r\n\r\nIn practice, these changes will not have any noticeable effect for the vast majority of nodes since the RPC server is not publicly accessible by default and also requires authentication.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it can still be useful for scenarios such as authenticated fuzz testing and improperly-configured networks that have disabled all other security measures.\r\n\r\n#### More Strict Cross Origin Request (CORS) Policy\r\n\r\nThe CORS policy for WebSocket clients is now more strict and rejects requests from other domains.\r\n\r\nIn practice, CORS requests will be rejected before ever reaching that point due to the use of a self-signed TLS certificate and the requirement for\r\nauthentication to issue any commands.  However, additional protection mechanisms make it that much more difficult to attack by providing defense in depth.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Client Authentication Method Based on TLS Certificates\r\n\r\nA new alternative method for TLS clients to authenticate to the RPC server by presenting a client certificate in the TLS handshake is now available.\r\n\r\nUnder this authentication method, the certificate authority for a client certificate must be added to the RPC server as a trusted root in order for it to trust the client.  Once activated, clients will no longer be required to provide HTTP Basic authentication nor use the `authenticate` RPC in the case of WebSocket clients.\r\n\r\nNote that while TLS client authentication has the potential to ultimately allow more fine grained access controls on a per-client basis, it currently only supports clients with full administrative privileges.  In other words, it is not currently compatible with the `--rpclimituser` and `--rpclimitpass` mechanism, so users depending on the limited user settings should avoid the new authentication method for now.\r\n\r\nThe new authentication type can be activated with the `--authtype=clientcert` configuration option.\r\n\r\nBy default, the trusted roots are loaded from the `clients.pem` file in dcrd's application data directory, however, that location can be modified via the `--clientcafile` option if desired.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Transaction Output Query RPC (`gettxout`)\r\n\r\nThe `gettxout` RPC has the following modifications:\r\n\r\n* An additional `tree` parameter is now required in order to explicitly identify the exact transaction output being requested\r\n* The transaction `version` field is no longer available in the primary JSON object of the results\r\n* The child `scriptPubKey` JSON object in the results now includes a new `version` field that identifies the scripting language version\r\n\r\nSee the [gettxout JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettxout) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Stake Difficulty Notification RPCs (`notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `notifystakedifficulty` and `stakedifficulty` WebSocket-only RPCs are no longer available.  This notification is unnecessary since the difficulty change interval is well defined.  Callers may obtain the difficulty via `getstakedifficulty` at the appropriate difficulty change intervals instead.\r\n\r\nSee the [getstakedifficulty JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getstakedifficulty) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Version 1 Filter RPCs (`getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `getcfilter` and `getcfilterheader` RPCs, which were previously used to obtain version 1 block filters via RPC are no longer available. Use `getcfilterv2` instead.\r\n\r\nSee the [getcfilterv2 JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getcfilterv2) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Median Time Field on Block Query RPCs (`getblock` and `getblockheader`)\r\n\r\nThe verbose results of the `getblock` and `getblockheader` RPCs now include a `mediantime` field that specifies the median block time associated with the block.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)\r\n* [getblockheader JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblockheader)\r\n\r\n#### New Scripting Language Version Field on Raw Transaction RPCs (`getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock`)\r\n\r\nThe verbose results of the `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction`, `searchrawtransactions`, and `getblock` RPCs now include a `version` field in the child `scriptPubKey` JSON object that identifies the scripting language version.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [getrawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawtransaction)\r\n* [decoderawtransaction JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#decoderawtransaction)\r\n* [searchrawtransactions JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#searchrawtransactions)\r\n* [getblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblock)\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Add Transaction Filter on Mempool Query RPC (`getrawmempool`)\r\n\r\nThe transaction type parameter of the `getrawmempool` RPC now accepts `tadd` to only include treasury add transactions in the results.\r\n\r\nSee the [getrawmempool JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getrawmempool) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Manual Block Invalidation and Reconsideration RPCs (`invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock`)\r\n\r\nA new pair of RPCs named `invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` are now available.  These RPCs can be used to manually invalidate a block as if it had violated consensus rules and reconsider a block for validation and best chain selection by removing any invalid status from it and its ancestors, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis capability is provided for development, testing, and debugging.  It can be particularly useful when developing services that build on top of Decred to more easily ensure edge conditions associated with invalid blocks and chain reorganization are being handled properly.\r\n\r\nThese RPCs do not apply to regular users and can safely be ignored outside of development.\r\n\r\nSee the following for API details:\r\n\r\n* [invalidateblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#invalidateblock)\r\n* [reconsiderblock JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#reconsiderblock)\r\n\r\n### Reject Protocol Message Deprecated (`reject`)\r\n\r\nThe `reject` peer-to-peer protocol message is now deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\nThis message is a holdover from the original codebase where it was required, but it really is not a useful message and has several downsides:\r\n\r\n* Nodes on the network must be trustless, which means anything relying on such a message is setting itself up for failure because nodes are not obligated to send it at all nor be truthful as to the reason\r\n* It can be harmful to privacy as it allows additional node fingerprinting\r\n* It can lead to security issues for implementations that don't handle it with proper sanitization practices\r\n* It can easily give software implementations the fully incorrect impression that it can be relied on for determining if transactions and blocks are valid\r\n* The only way it is actually used currently is to show a debug log message, however, all of that information is already available via the peer and/or wire logging anyway\r\n* It carries a non-trivial amount of development overhead to continue to support it when nothing actually uses it\r\n\r\n### No DNS Seeds Command-Line Option Deprecated (`--nodnsseed`)\r\n\r\nThe `--nodnsseed` command-line configuration option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Use `--noseeders` instead.\r\n\r\nDNS seeding has not been used since the previous release.\r\n\r\n## Notable New Developer Modules\r\n\r\n### Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters \r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf` module is now available that provides Age-Partitioned Bloom Filters (APBFs).\r\n\r\nAn APBF is a probabilistic lookup device that can quickly determine if it contains an element.  It permits tracking large amounts of data while using very little memory at the cost of a controlled rate of false positives.  Unlike classic Bloom filters, it is able to handle an unbounded amount of data by aging and discarding old items.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example of actual savings achieved in Decred by making use of an APBF, the memory to track addresses known by 125 peers was reduced from ~200 MiB to ~5 MiB.\r\n\r\nSee the [apbf module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/container/apbf) for full details on usage, accuracy under workloads, expected memory usage, and performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Fixed-Precision Unsigned 256-bit Integers\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256` module is now available that provides highly optimized allocation free fixed precision unsigned 256-bit integer arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThe package has a strong focus on performance and correctness and features arithmetic, boolean comparison, bitwise logic, bitwise shifts, conversion to/from relevant types, and full formatting support - all served with an ergonomic API, full test coverage, and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nEvery operation is faster than the standard library `big.Int` equivalent and the primary math operations provide reductions of over 90% in the calculation time. Most other operations are also significantly faster.\r\n\r\nSee the [uint256 module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/math/uint256) for full details on usage, including a categorized summary, and performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Standard Scripts\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript` package is now available that provides facilities for identifying and extracting data from transaction scripts that are considered standard by the default policy of most nodes.\r\n\r\nThe package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.\r\n\r\nSee the [stdscript package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdscript) for full details on usage and a list of the recognized standard scripts.\r\n\r\n### Standard Addresses\r\n\r\nA new `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr` package is now available that provides facilities for working with human-readable Decred payment addresses.\r\n\r\nThe package is part of the `github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4` module.\r\n\r\nSee the [stdaddr package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/decred/dcrd/txscript/v4/stdaddr) for full details on usage and a list of the supported addresses.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 875 commits from 16 contributors which total to 492 files changed, 77921 additional lines of code, and 30952 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.6.0...release-v1.7.0-rc1).\r\n\r\nSee the [dcrd's own release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.7.0-rc1) for a categorized breakdown of all commits since the last release.\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- briancolecoinmetrics\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- David Hill\r\n- degeri\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku\r\n- J Fixby\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- Joe Gruffins\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- lolandhold\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Naveen\r\n- Ryan Staudt\r\n- Youssef Boukenken\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"dcrwallet-v170-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.7.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on implementing a mixing protocol change to add additional post-quantum security in the key exchanges, improvements to VSP ticketbuying, and adding support for current dcrd consensus agendas.\r\n\r\nThis prerelease software contains a database upgrade.  Testers are advised to backup their wallet databases before upgrading.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Mixing support now uses a different, incompatible protocol for extra security.  Users of the cspp.decred.org mix server are advised to updated their configurations to use mix.decred.org.  A new server certificate will need to be downloaded as well.\r\n* New JSON-RPC methods (`settreasurypolicy`, `settspendpolicy`, `treasurypolicy`, `tspendpolicy`) were added to control the approval policy of treasury expenditure transactions.  Policies are set on a per-key basis with overriding policies for particular transaction hashes.\r\n* The `purchaseticket` JSON-RPC method now respects mixing configurations and will buy mixed tickets when these settings are used.\r\n* A `mixsplitlimit` config option was added to control how many concurrent connections may be made to the mixer server for a given output value for account and change mixing.\r\n* The `walletinfo` JSON-RPC method now returns whether the wallet is in SPV mode or not.\r\n* The `validateaddress` JSON-RPC and `WalletService.ValidateAddress` gRPC methods now include additional wallet information for decoded wallet address, including the account and branch paths.\r\n* It is now possible to import extended xpriv accounts that are derived from arbitrary seeds.  This is intended for importing accounts for voting and is performed with the `WalletService.ImportVotingAccountFromSeed` gRPC method.\r\n* The `getblock`, `getblockheader`, `getcfilterv2`, `getcurrentnet` `gettxout`, and JSON-RPC methods are now supported under SPV mode.\r\n* The median time is now included reported by the `getblock` JSON-RPC response.\r\n* The `WalletService.DiscoverUsage` gRPC method was added to force address and account discovery.\r\n* The `WalletService.ImportExtendedPublicKey` gRPC method was added to import xpubs as accounts (providing the same functionality as the `importxpub` JSON-RPC method).\r\n* Ticket tracking in the database now records which VSP (if any) a ticket was  purchased for.  This allows the VSP client to check the status of previously-bought tickets without the polling every VSP for the ticket info. VSP tickets will also processed even if no current VSP is configured in the current application settings.\r\n* The `ticketbuyer.limit` option now defaults to 1.\r\n* A `logsize` config option was added to control how large log files may become before they are rotated and compressed.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* The wallet no longer attempts to perform votes or revocations if the wallet only has an imported address or pubkey but no private key to sign the transaction inputs.\r\n* The `ticketbuyer.limit` config option now controls how many separate connections are made to the mix server with distinct groups of transaction inputs to mix.  This reduces mix correlation of larger sets of inputs with their change output.\r\n* The `WalletService.Accounts` gRPC method response now contains the last returned account indexes rather than the total number of keys in an account, which more accurately reflects account usage due to how the gap limit is internally handled by the wallet.\r\n* A bug negatively affecting performance and memory usage related to address watching was corrected.\r\n* Several issues preventing blockchain reorganization from being handled correctly in SPV mode were fixed.\r\n* Several deadlocks in the SPV implementation mode were corrected.\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation for multisig transactions was improved.\r\n* Data races were corrected.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.6.3...release-v1.7.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* David Hill\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* JoeGruffins\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n* Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v170-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.7.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release of Decrediton includes numerous bug fixes and refinement across all pages/tabs.  \r\n\r\nWe have overhauled the security of Decrediton so that we can keep using electron in the future, with a decent amount of assurance that it's\r\nsafe and not prone to intrusion.  The overal gist of the work done could be described simply as: layer/context isolation.  We reduced the total number of dependencies as well as the access those dependencies may have to private information.  Users will be shown some new modals while confirming wallet seeds and confirming destination addresses.\r\n\r\nDCRDEX is now at 0.4.0 and considered to be fully integrated with Decrediton.  Some extra work has been done to improve bitcoin config handling and overall stability of new DEX account creation.  Users are now able to restore their DEX accounts with a seed from their DCRDEX windows.  This should help users avoid  paying fees to trading servers unnecessarily. There are a few remaining features that will be added in the future (dcrwallet SPV and ETH support), but overall is  feature complete in terms of decrediton pieces.\r\n\r\nWe have begun to implement redesigns to some areas of decrediton.  The Governance and LN pages got full redesigns.  Changes were also made to the confirm seed view screen.  There will be more of these redesigns implemented in the near future: Settings and Launcher (wallet selection) coming up next!\r\n\r\nWe have also added test coverage to all of the tabs on the Transactions page.  Ideally, as we increase test coverage we will avoid bugs caused by regressions or oversight.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have begun the process of using our react component library: pi-ui.  Things like text inputs, paginators, toggles, radio buttons are now from pi-ui.  Centralizing these components should streamline the look and feel across many Decred products (politeia, cms, decrediton).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* We have added a few new tools that will hopefully reduce the amount of support requests that are commonly issued.  First, when restoring a wallet from seed users are now given the option to 'disable coin type upgrades' which will allow older wallet (pre-2017) to be restored on the previous coin type.  We have also added a 'gap limit' setting when restoring, this should help avoid  address indexes being not correctly synced which could result in incorrect balances being shown.  Note: If the gap limit is changed on restore, then that gap limit will be used for that wallet from then on.  \r\n\r\n  For wallets that have already been restored that may have incorrect address indices, we have replaced the Gap Limit in settings with a 'discover usage' tool.  This will allow users to properly determine their address indices and balances.\r\n\r\n* We have added the ability to revoke tickets while in SPV mode.  This seems to be a common request in support.  The new 'revoke ticket' button is found in the transaction details for any non-spent ticket.  Users will be presented with a confirmation modal that informs them of the risk of attempting to revoke before that confirm that the ticket is missed on dcrdata.  (They would have to Abandon the 'bad' revocation transaction and rescan.)\r\n\r\n* We have decided to hide the legacy ticket purchase area.  We will wait until a later date to remove the components and code itself, but after 1.7.0 users will only be able to purchase private/acccount-less tickets.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issues with the Sync VSP Tickets dropdown\r\n* Various fixes for Trezor wallets.\r\n* VSPD ticket processing has been fixed and revamped.  A new status of  'confirmed' has been added.  This should reduce the number of misses that some users have encountered during the changeover from legacy ticket purchasing.\r\n* Fix issue that caused large input transactions (eg PoW mining payouts) to crash decrediton.  These transactions caused large numbers of addresses to be validated within dcrwallet which lead to resource exhaustion.  \r\n* Make sure that the unmixed account was unlocked when using the ticket autobuyer.  This could cause funds not to be spent during auto-buying.  We never had any reports of this, so unsure of the overall usage of autobuyer in general.\r\n* Fix duplicate ticket transactions being shown in the Ticket History.  Each are now labeled appropriately (eg Vote, Voted, Revoke, Revoked)\r\n* Add insufficient balance check for the account mixer.  Previously the mixer could be started even if there was no balance to mix.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.6.3...release-v1.7.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* Amir Massarwa\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Degeri\r\n* Guilherme Marques\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* Joe Gruffins\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Jonathan Zeppettini\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n\r\n<a id=\"downloads-v170-rc1\" />"}

focuses on bug fixes and feature improvements for VSP ticket buying.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* An `AccountUnlocked` gRPC method was added to query if an account is individually encrypted and its current locked state.\r\n\r\n* A `GetTrackedVSPTickets` gRPC method was added for clients to gain insight into what tickets and fees are currently being processed by the VSP client.\r\n\r\n* A `syncstatus` JSON-RPC method was added to query whether the wallet is known to be synchronized with the network or not, or whether it is still performing initial synchronization.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Additional situations which caused unexpected \"low balance\" bugs when purchasing tickets with a VSP have been fixed by attempting to create the additional split transaction.\r\n\r\n* Reliability improvements were made to ensuring that fees are correctly paid to the VSP.  This will result in lower missed ticket rates.\r\n\r\n* A bug preventing correct key derivation for keys in a locked individually-encrypted account when all other wallet accounts were unlocked was fixed by deriving the pubkey, rather than erroring when attempting to derive the private key.\r\n\r\n* A data race dealing with the synchronization of managing locked outputs was fixed.\r\n\r\n* The automated ticketbuyer no longer errors for unlocking the wallet with an empty passphrase if the account is individually-encrypted and is unlocked by another method.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.6.2...release-v1.6.3).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* David Hill\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n* Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n<a id=\"decrediton-v163\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.6.3\r\n\r\nThis release of Decrediton includes the initial DEX integration, as well as many other graphical improvements, security upgrades, and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* This release includes our first iteration of DCRDEX being available directly within Decrediton.  There is a new page available, 'DEX' on the sidebar.  Initially, users will be presented with the option to \"enable\" DEX on their wallet.  Currently, we suggest using a separate wallet to use for DEX trading, instead of a users' main wallet.  While we believe the wallet is still secure, the DEX integration has increased the attack surface of the wallet, so it is worth taking extra precaution while using this feature.\r\n\r\n  Once enabled, users need to set a DEX passphrase.  This passphrase is what they will use to Login and to submit orders etc.  Next they need to select or create a new account for DEX.  Theses funds are what will be accessible inside of the DCRDEX trading platform.\r\n\r\n  Users must then connect their DCR and BTC wallets to DEX.  Once connected, they will be guided to register their DEX account and pay the required fee.\r\n\r\n  Once these steps are complete they will be able to launch the trading platform.  Upon attempting to close Decrediton, there will be an attempt to logout of the DEX.  If there are any open orders, Decrediton will not be allowed to close.  This is to ensure that the swaps are able to complete successfully.\r\n\r\n* With the introduction of DEX and privacy into Decrediton, we've decided to upgrade some of the security features in the wallet.  While most of this is invisible to the user (Electron/Webpack upgrades), we have added per-account locking.  Previously, when any action occured the whole wallet was unlocked and then relocked upon completion.  Now only the pertinent account for the transcation will be unlocked.  This will protect other accounts for situations like DEX and mixing where accounts will be unlocked for long periods of time.\r\n\r\n* We have improved the new vspd ticket tracking so fees are now paid more frequently and process managed tickets is only shown when the user hasn't yet fully confirmed their tickets with the vspd.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.6.2...release-v1.6.3).\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n* Amir Massarwa\r\n* bgptr\r\n* Guilherme Marques\r\n* Jamie Holdstock\r\n* Joe Gruffins\r\n* Matheus Degiovani\r\n* Scott Christian\r\n* Victor Oliveira\r\n\r\n<a id=\"dcrdex-v020\" />\r\n\r\n# DCRDEX v0.2.0\r\n\r\nThis release includes a large number of improvements to the UI, the communications protocol, and software design.\r\n\r\nThe most notable new features are:\r\n\r\n- Numerous UI and usability enhancements including responsive design and depth chart interactivity\r\n- Support client control by the Decrediton GUI wallet and use of its accounts\r\n- Experimental Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support\r\n- Initial changes to support SPV (light) wallets in the next release\r\n- Account import/export\r\n\r\nThe latest 1.6 release of dcrd and dcrwallet is required for this release of DCRDEX. At the time of release, this corresponds to the v1.6.2 releases. Bitcoin Core 0.20 and 0.21 are both supported.\r\n\r\n## Important Notices\r\n\r\nAlthough DCRDEX looks and feels like a regular exchange, the \"decentralized\" aspect brings an expanded role to the client. Please take the time to read and understand the following:\r\n\r\n- Ensure your nodes (and wallets) are fully **synchronized with the blockchain network before placing orders**.\r\n- **Never shutdown your wallets with dexc running**. When shutting down, always stop dexc before stopping your wallets.\r\n- If you have to restart dexc with active orders or swaps, you must  **immediately login again with your app password when dexc starts up**.\r\n- There is an \"inaction timeout\" when it becomes your client's turn to broadcast a transaction, so be sure not to stop dexc or lose connectivity for longer than that or you risk having your active orders and swaps/matches revoked. If you do have to restart dexc, remember to login as soon as you start it up again.\r\n- Only one dexc (client) process should be running for a given user account at any time. For example, if you have identical dexc configurations on two computers and you run dexc and login on both, neither dexc instance will be adequately connected to successfully negotiate swaps. Also note that order history is not synchronized between different installations.\r\n- Your DEX server accounts exist inside the dexc.db file, the location of which depends on operating system, but is typically in ~/.dexc/mainnet/dexc.db or %HOMEPATH%\\Local\\Dexc\\mainnet\\dexc.db. Do not delete this file.\r\n- If you use a non-default bitcoin wallet name, don't forget to set it in bitcoin.conf with a `wallet=wallet_name_here` line so that bitcoind will load it each time it starts. Otherwise, dexc will give you a \"wallet not found\" error on startup and login.\r\n- bitcoind's \"smart\" fee estimation needs plenty of time to warm up or it is not so smart. When possible, keep your bitcoind running for at least 6 blocks, especially if had not been running for more than an hour, or ensure that the value returned from a bitcoin-cli call to `estimatesmartfee 1` returns a `\"feerate\"` close to what <https://mempool.space/> reports as \"High priority\".\r\n\r\n## Client (dexc)\r\n\r\n### Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n- Experimental support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). ([542ed9b](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/542ed9ba9ef8db3d8f5d3e36b3078c9fa3d5888f))\r\n- Show confirmations for swaps transactions on the Order page when a swap has not yet reached the required number of confirmations. ([ecbfebd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ecbfebdd6f3184b51d6f72011b488edd73e3c5cb))\r\n- Open dialogs can be closed by hitting the \"Escape\" key. ([7c978cd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/7c978cd8436c3fab9e90a80d1a17502e945e76f8))\r\n- Allow changing the dex client \"application password\". ([8d7163c](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8d7163cb9022f9f19ef706f33251a32d228d1c02))\r\n- Responsive browser UI design. ([c91bde4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c91bde4446a5d3e6c3db20a805da380d4c6bf835))\r\n- Differentiate between buy/sell orders in confirmation modal dialog. ([2bdf81f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2bdf81f94262c34a345c84daf4def921e41c7107))\r\n- Clearer revocation notifications. ([c8c9729](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c8c9729ba6adb5a1803a8a7e9de30e8aaa81c942))\r\n- Raw transaction data is now transmitted to counterparties in the `'audit'` and `'match_status'` requests. This is a prerequisite for SPV clients. ([3704513](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3704513bc63facc234edabf742ec1f87ef80b35d))\r\n- More chart interactivity. (a) Indicators on the depth chart for the user's orders. When the mouse hovers near the indicator, the order is highlighted in the \"Your Orders\" table. Conversely, when the mouse hovers over a row in the \"Your Orders\" table, the indicator is highlighted on the chart. (b) Move the legend and hover info to the top. (c) When a rate is entered in the order form for a limit order, display a line indicator at that rate on the depth chart. (d) When the user hovers over an order in the buy/sell tables, display an indicator at that rate on the depth chart. (e) Last zoom level is saved across markets and reloads. (f) Display the total buy/sell volume. ([fb6f3ea](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/fb6f3eaa7dae7d043aae8ceb5771638554dd5d1c), [08ec4ac](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/08ec4ac99f06aa23d654cd3855c62c13945b2a2e))\r\n- Multiple authorized browser sessions are now permitted. This refers to logging in to dexc from two different browsers that do not share a cookie store. This is now permitted, however, signing *out* of one session signs out of all sessions. ([030173b](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/030173b828fabb0cb4b2c9884bbeaa91b1ce7f11))\r\n- A wallet's connection settings and private passphrase can be changed at the same time. Developers should see the `ReconfigureWallet` change. ([761e3e1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/761e3e13981a9595623718036913fe54a2c2d764))\r\n- Add account import/export functions. ([1a38c4d](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1a38c4decea6c0c02370edf4ed4eee833afbe8c8))\r\n- Add account disable function. ([f414a87](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f414a87a3991d8abbdd8347dc46fe350c96d9981))\r\n- Starting dexc when a configured DEX server is unreachable starts a reconnect attempt loop. Previously it was necessary to restart dexc later and hope the server was back. ([c782ffb](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c782ffb0a8e4b8dd11360c8a6394a6b64c91cd3e))\r\n- Account-based DCR wallet locking support. With dcrwallet 1.6, accounts may be individually encrypted, with a unique password, in contrast to whole-wallet locking. This allows working with such accounts by using the `accountunlocked` dcrwallet RPC to determine the locking scheme for an account, and the `unlockaccount`/`lockaccount` RPCs instead of `walletpassphrase`/`walletlock`. The \"beta\" simnet DCR harness now uses an individually-encrypted \"default\" account. ([ff4e76c](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ff4e76cc509e0019f1239316db9e8c7639faf38f), [37cdc9e](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/37cdc9e640e032ec9b0f0f2da12be637e0f696ea))\r\n- Handling of new server-provided fee rates. This will support SPV clients, and helps ensure that both redeem and order funding transactions are not created with low fee rates when the client's wallet/node is not providing good estimates. ([79a1cb0](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/79a1cb016f8d08354610767e890c78a9bd3470b4))\r\n- Network-specific loopback IPs for the webserver and RPC server listen addresses. Now by default, dexc listens on 127.0.0.1 for mainnet, 127.0.0.2 for testnet, and 127.0.0.3 for simnet. Users are still be able to specify custom addresses with `webaddr` and `rpcaddr`. ([08ec4ac](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/08ec4ac99f06aa23d654cd3855c62c13945b2a2e))\r\n- Maximum order size estimates on order dialog. Get maximum order estimates based on wallet balances and, in the case of buy orders, the rate in the rate input field. The data is shown in the UI as a small message above the rate field. When you click on the label, the quantity fields are pre-populated with the max order. ([920d1ac](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/920d1ac50b748ea17c177fe5cad2259300361fef))\r\n- dexcctl / RPC server: Add a matches list to the `myorders` response. ([3bef6ba](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3bef6ba8ff8df2af7a8c37fd1c43e6119a1af32f))\r\n- When orders are placed, the client remembers the expected maximum fee rate, and verifies that the rate provided by the server at match time does not exceed this amount. ([2123f10](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2123f10a509bbf26ba3e74d3a7583b6524ba9191))\r\n- Add a \"fee rate limit\" setting to each wallet that is checked against the max fee rate set by the server's config. Orders are blocked by the client if the server specifies a max fee rate that exceeds the client's limit. ([414ffcc](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/414ffccd83972718d9c3058526101ab745eb36d2))\r\n- On shutdown, the active orders are logged, and inactive trades have their coins released to the wallet if they were not already. ([41749a8](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/41749a83afb9f234c3f5c5755367df3beb77d8f1))\r\n- Add sample config files. (also server) ([792602b](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/792602bdab53f2b933f51142df79432fada378e8))\r\n- The `'init'` and `'redeem'` requests are now run asynchronously so most other actions are not blocked while waiting for a response. This is generally an internal change, but it may improve the overall responsiveness of the dexc application. ([a0538bb](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a0538bbef5460dd08342b8c99851bc6076faea73))\r\n- Preimage request handling is reworked to prevent blocking for a long period given an incoming preimage request for an unknown order. ([1b66492](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1b66492b1ef53670f32c19b484e7366fab977993))\r\n- Add a custom webserver \"site\" directory argument. ([4506406](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/4506406d974aaa8463a2e924ccdf1147d8078c45))\r\n- Favor confirmed UTXOs in BTC order funding. This is primarily an internal change, but it can defend against swaps that take too long to confirm. ([3f6e429](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3f6e4299c81751558891bcc209cd50825e10183c))\r\n- \"Long\" execution times (more than 250ms) for incoming message handling and track ticks are now logged. ([529cb0d](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/529cb0d17154f3a8a391848fa8eb2ff65453ed9c))\r\n\r\n### Developer\r\n\r\n- When `Core` is shut down, wallets are locked when the `Run` method returns. Previously, wallets were only locked if the consumer used `PromptShutdown`. ([8976d8d](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8976d8d166706ba626cee437d8765fa3ca3794e4)) This change was in 0.1.5, but it is reiterated here as it is an significant change in behavior that Go consumers should note.\r\n- Updates to the `User` struct returned by the `User` and `Exchanges` methods of `client/core.Core`.  The `client/core.Market` has replaced the `{Base,Quote}{Order,Contract}Locked` fields with methods. ([167efd4](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/167efd491eb5eed4c1980995be6b48ea5a780f2a))\r\n- When specifying TLS certificates, allow either a filename or the contents of the certificate file. This applies to the `Register`, `GetFee`, and `GetDEXConfig` methods of `client/core.Core`. ([44a3363](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/44a33633e40bee15e70b700b982c69833317692f))\r\n- Notification subjects are now package-level constants. ([3aef72d](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3aef72d00790b2d8b0354efaf844a8fd08f3bdc6))\r\n- `ReconfigureWallet` has a new pass input (`nil` indicates no password change). ([761e3e1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/761e3e13981a9595623718036913fe54a2c2d764))\r\n- New order fee estimate API. See the new `(*Core).PreOrder` method and the new returned `OrderEstimate` type. Also see the `PreSwap` and `PreRedeem` methods of `client/asset.Wallet`, and the new types of the same name. ([5394cea](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5394ceaa2a0e69518cabb2a3ae4fdb2164a6a08e))\r\n- New `isinitialized` http API endpoint and `Core` method. ([b767a23](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b767a23f0c89ec54a1f60e61c9bd21d05daba906))\r\n- Add the `(*Core).GetDEXConfig` method and a corresponding http API endpoint `getdexinfo` the functions similar to `getfee` by making a temporary connection to a DEX with *no existing account*, except that it returns the server's entire config. ([d85f6bc](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/d85f6bc34d74773a56500089ff4d12e0e3d3380e))\r\n- Check the server's API version and each asset's version that are now returned in the server's `'config'` response. ([e59b47f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/e59b47fe777ba94741a38da62b06edd317101873), [205e802](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/205e8022adcaf8e7a5bda026e80d43edc3c07497), [1bc0cc9](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1bc0cc9e9c1ffab8b6ed37dcad96cc136bbcf33f))\r\n- Only active orders are listed by the `User` and `Exchanges` methods of `Core`. Completed orders that are pending retirement are excluded. ([6358d97](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/6358d97fe1a1977c363519a98c15273c0612a6b2))\r\n- Add profiling switches to dcrdex. A CPU profile file may be specified with `--cpuprofile`. The http profiler may be started with `--httpprof`. ([c17baf9](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c17baf93a76f6803af1d354bf0d9d7a51332e475))\r\n- (internal) DCR asset backends now use `rpcclient/v6`, which provide cancelable requests. ([312397a](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/312397a56d307f71c12696bcaae126f4629c7aea), [9d65d55](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/9d65d55c8f3b0ca613fb3a7d401346706d65d7e7))\r\n- (internal) BTC's asset backend now uses Decred's `rpcclient` package for cancellation capability. All request now use `RawRequest`. ([cefe6a5](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/cefe6a5ced3cce460311d3b50dffdfd4ce9aa22f))\r\n- (internal) All incoming response and notification message handlers are wrapped for panic recovery. ([829a661](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/829a661a4c134ad575f9fdbac67b812c73a53589))\r\n- (internal) Message unmarshalling is now more robust with respect to null payloads. ([9bf1a3e](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/9bf1a3eeacb86247e8b33067aabcf7fc0cf59f8a))\r\n- Many third party Go dependency updates. ([go.mod diff](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/compare/4517832...release-v0.2#diff-33ef32bf6c23acb95f5902d7097b7a1d5128ca061167ec0716715b0b9eeaa5f6))\r\n- Update site build system to Webpack 5, and update most other deps. ([a8e76ea](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a8e76eacdecf4e30d96248a885c13a27f81a867e))\r\n- Add an ETH simnet harness for support of upcoming ETH support. ([ea10f5a](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/ea10f5a032ddc365f6982de2f0956e560a26dc2e))\r\n- The simnet harnesses now listen on all interfaces. ([4e246cf](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/4e246cfbef547f41fee5bad2ab397ab80d89dc2a))\r\n- The Decred wallet harnesses now start dcrwallet with http profiling enabled. ([b96f546](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b96f546f3ff67c3fed3f013023c395daab115fc0))\r\n- Rework the `db.MetaMatch` struct. ([db3df62](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/db3df625eb736442a464dcc3aea424e8a8491a78))\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\nIn addition to numerous fixes that were also in the 0.1.x releases, the most notable fixes are:\r\n\r\n- No longer show the Register dialog if the server for the only registered DEX happens to be down at the time. ([b6ea0ea](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b6ea0eaccd92f0c1fe8058a943013217cbf38b0e))\r\n- Correct handling of IPv6 listen addresses. (also on server) ([f0ef965](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f0ef965103e035052c5034d0486b44881a0c1067))\r\n- Update the browser UI when orders are placed via dexcctl. ([8cc1502](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8cc1502b0bb511513c0cf70117cbc29b0952f8db))\r\n- Better error reporting on the DEX registration dialog. ([2617d75](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/2617d750f5207d52dfb7afab82634253a99b514c))\r\n- More robust recovery for orders that become unfunded (e.g. user spends coins that were reserved for an order). ([122277e](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/122277ec0eca5e5cb8151536aa2e2532d15d9af2))\r\n- No longer prematurely broadcast Decred refund transactions. ([03cdf2d](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/03cdf2d473fc7546892112d78cfa3cfeb6a89605))\r\n- Commitment checksum handling in the presence of missed preimage is now handled the same way as on the server by including the all epoch order commitments in the csum computation, not just the ones with revealed preimages.

An example URL is `/orderbook/dcr/btc`. `/config` is another WebSocket route that is also now available over HTTP too. ([08afde3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/08afde3f7bb5d9df5579621ed0e7ae9850424744))\r\n- Configurable trade limits with the new `--inittakerlotlimit` and `--abstakerlotlimit` dcrdex switches, and `userBookedLotLimit` set in markets.json. ([5771186](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/5771186321eb7b969685fc722ffdb65d42a64539))\r\n- Provide API and asset versions in the `'config'` response.

With this data provided to the clients, minimum fee rates of zero-conf funding coins are enforced. ([79a1cb0](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/79a1cb016f8d08354610767e890c78a9bd3470b4), [9885bf1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/9885bf1ed697bd82ba300ed33c98647c2413df8f))\r\n- Fix market suspension not purging the outgoing book router's orders list. The actual book was purged, but clients would still pull a book snapshot listing orders if they restarted after a purge. ([a25d14e](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a25d14e3a397268bae8a8e899b836d53e0219d79))\r\n- Order priority queue automatic reallocation and smaller initial capacity.

to introduce a quality of life change for lightweight clients, such as SPV wallets, by not sending them a certain class of announcements that only full nodes are equiped to handle.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis patch release consists of 2 commits from 1 contributor which total to 3 files changed, 55 additional lines of code, and 31 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.6.1...release-v1.6.2).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and Network\r\n\r\n- server: Only send fast block anns to full nodes ([decred/dcrd#2609](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2609))\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- release: Bump for 1.6.2 ([decred/dcrd#2629](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2629))\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrwallet-v162\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.6.2\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on bug fixes and feature improvements for VSP ticketbuying and change mixing.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* A `accountunlocked` JSON-RPC method was added, allowing clients to determine whether an account has been encrypted with a unique passphrase, and if it is currently unlocked if so.\r\n\r\n* The `setvotechoices` JSON-RPC method will now use the vspd client to set vote choices at the VSP, if any is configured in the application settings and the ticket was bought for the VSP.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* A UTXO selection issue which caused \"low balance\" errors during the additional split transaction sometimes necessary when purchasing tickets with a VSP was fixed.  Some UTXOs of the account were not always being considered during the creation of this transaction, which led to the balance errors.\r\n\r\n* A check for a too-low fee when mixing at the smallest common amount was added. This previously was causing \"invalid submission\" errors, as the server would reject the submission for not paying enough fee.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.6.1...release-v1.6.2).\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n* Jonathan Chappelow\r\n* Josh Rickmar\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v162\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.6.2\r\n\r\nThis patch release for Decrediton includes just a few small changes for copy and buttons missing text.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Missing Legacy Ticket purchase button text.\r\n\r\n* Incorrect copy on Governance for thresholds for upgrading the network.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.6.1...release-v1.6.2).\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n- Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- Amir Massarwa\r\n- bgptr\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n\r\n<a name=\"downloads-v162\" />\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/decred/decred-binaries/releases/40717827/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}}

is a patch release of dcrd which includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Correct a hard to hit issue where connections might not be reestablished after a network outage under some rare circumstances\r\n- Allow stakeholders to make use of the staking system to force proof-of-work miners to upgrade to the latest version so voting on the new consensus changes can commence\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis patch release consists of 3 commits from 1 contributor which total to 3 files changed, 30 additional lines of code, and 9 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last

([decred/dcrd#2588](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2588))\r\n- server: Force PoW upgrade to v8 ([decred/dcrd#2597](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2597))\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- release: Bump for 1.6.1 ([decred/dcrd#2600](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2600))\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrwallet-v161\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.6.1\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on fixing issues with the new VSP fee payments and account mixing.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* A `WalletServer.SetVspdVoteChoice` gRPC method was added, allowing clients to update the agenda preferences for the new VSP software.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* An additional transaction may be created now when an account does not have enough UTXOs to pay for both a ticket and a VSP fee.  This avoids insufficient balance errors where possible and prevents the user from needing to split a UTXO themselves.\r\n\r\n* Several issues causing double spends when dealing with unpublished transactions were corrected.  This improves the reliability of paying the VSP fee.\r\n\r\n* Account balances no longer report the outputs of unpublished transactions as spendable with minconf=0.  Instead, these balances are added to the unconfirmed balance.\r\n\r\n* Account and output mixing now considers the required fee necessary when selecting which common output amount and output count to mix with.  This fixes mixing for some outputs which are currently being rejected by the CoinShuffle++ server due to not paying enough of the required transaction fee.\r\n\r\n* The `signrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method was changed to return an error if the transaction being signed has no inputs.\r\n\r\n* The salsa20 and blake2b dependencies were updated to prevent possible memory corruption caused by smashing the SP register in optimized assembly implementations.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.6.0...release-v1.6.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v161\" />\r\n\r\n# Decrediton v1.6.1\r\n\r\nThis patch release fixes several issues discovered in the v1.6.0 release.\r\n\r\nMost changes are focused on improving the staking experience with the new VSP system: unexpected insufficient balance error is fixed, successes and failures of various staking operations are better reported now, setting consensus vote choices on the new VSP was implemented.\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n* Consensus change voting is now working as expected.  When a user sets their vote choice, it is updated in their local wallet and also sent to any legacy VSP.  Every live ticket they have assigned with a new VSP is updated as well.\r\n\r\n* Due to the way the coins (UTXOs) are handled when purchasing tickets, there is a possibility of the underlying dcrwallet purchasing fewer tickets than what the user requested.  This condition is now explained with a better message, to help the user understand why, for example, they only got 1 ticket when trying to buy 2.\r\n\r\n* Labels on the Staking tab have been updated to make things more clear with the new tickets and the old tickets.\r\n\r\n* An initial Traditional Chinese translation was completed by @smartwojak and verified by long-standing community member Hugo Chang (@changhugo).\r\n\r\n* Running or attempting multiple things at the same time is no longer allowed to avoid possible issues or unexpected errors.  For instance, when the mixer is running, users may not purchase tickets or run the autobuyer, and vice versa.  To perform an action, the user needs to turn off a running activity before proceeding. Several tooltips have been added to make the user aware of the situation.\r\n\r\n* Loading indicators have been added to various buttons related to ticket purchasing, to indicate that the user should wait for a long-running operation (like mixed ticket purchasing) to complete.\r\n\r\n* Success and failure messages have been added to various new ticket purchasing actions. Now users will be shown a message when they successfully complete (or receive errors for) the following actions: verify that visible tickets are assigned to VSPs and have their fees paid (Process Managed), discover tickets not yet assigned to a VSP and pay their fees (Process Unmanaged), and sync failed VSP tickets.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Added a timeout when not receiving VSP status response within 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n* Transaction history filtering has been fixed and now allows to select multiple types of transactions at once.\r\n\r\n* Tickets will now show as \"Processing\", \"Error\" or \"Paid\" shortly after purchase.  Previously they would be shown as \"Solo\" until a restart or another block was mined.\r\n\r\n* Added explicit wallet lock calls to ensure that wallet is locked after mixing or ticket autobuyer requests.\r\n\r\n* There were a few reports of incorrectly created legacy ticket purchases due to a still unknown cause.  To work-around this we've added sanity checks prior to purchase request to dcrwallet to avoid any potential malformed requests from being sent.  This won't solve the core issue, but should at least notify users of something wrong occuring and give us data to investigate further.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.6.0...release-v1.6.1).\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order)\r\n\r\n- Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- Amir Massarwa\r\n- bgptr\r\n- Guilherme Marques\r\n- JoeGruffins\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Scott Christian\r\n- smartwojak\r\n- Victor Oliveira\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrdex-v015\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrdex v0.1.5\r\n\r\nThis patch release provides several important bug fixes.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [initial release (v0.1.0) notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.0) for important information and instructions.\r\n\r\n## Client (dexc)\r\n\r\n### Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* The user's account ID is now logged on connection and authentication with a DEX server. ([8ce328](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8ce328cacc4d7b0d35973a39917eef48ac1d1d64))\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix a possible panic when reconfiguring a wallet that is not connected. ([dfe4cd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/dfe4cd12234d1d17d6114f3de8f062ff912c594b))\r\n\r\n* When resuming trades on startup and login, counterparty contract audits now retry repeatedly, as is the case when an audit request is initially received. This prevents a match from being incorrectly revoked on startup if the wallet/node fails to locate the counterparty contract immediately. ([dfe4cd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/dfe4cd12234d1d17d6114f3de8f062ff912c594b))\r\n\r\n* The client's database subsystem is always started first and stopped last. This is a prerequisite for the following wallet lock-on-shutdown change. ([b4ef3f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/b4ef3ff01f3a1567aecf762c5db75f83a9687d64))\r\n\r\n* On shutdown of client `Core`, the wallets are now locked even if the `PromptShutdown` function is not used.  This does not affect dexc users, only direct Go consumers of the `client/core.Core` type. ([70044e](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/70044e68740faffc4888c6f4b4303806531a0255))\r\n\r\n* Fix a possible interruption of the DEX reconnect loop if the config response timed out. ([4df683](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/4df683a10d755d71f37c979655b6ceea6343db8d))\r\n\r\n* Update the crypto/x/blake2 dependency to prevent silent memory corruption from the hash function's assembly code. ([c67af3](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c67af3f3b88750e69957e019d9eacc80d6aa7555))\r\n\r\n* Handle orders that somehow lose their funding coins.  Previously, such orders would forever be logged at startup but never retired, and any matches from such orders that required swap negotiation of other recovery would have been improperly abandoned. ([a7b5aa](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a7b5aa0a67dd2962c33d229cf101c59e85cb7b85))\r\n\r\n## Server (dcrdex)\r\n\r\nThere are no substantive server changes, just a few logging improvements.\r\n\r\n## Code Summary\r\n\r\n11 commits, 13 files changed, 564 insertions(+), and 254 deletions(-)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/decred/dcrdex/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5\r\n\r\n3 contributors\r\n\r\n- Brian Stafford (@buck54321) (review)\r\n- David Hill (@dajohi) (blake2 fix)\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow (@chappjc)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"downloads-v161\" />\r\n"}

/>\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.6.0\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd introduces a large number of updates.  Some of the key highlights are:\r\n\r\n* A new consensus vote agenda which allows the stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate support for a decentralized treasury\r\n* Aggregate fee transaction selection in block templates (Child Pays For Parent)\r\n* Improved peer discovery via HTTPS seeding with filtering capabilities\r\n* Major performance enhancements for signature validation and other cryptographic operations\r\n* Approximately 15% less overall resident memory usage\r\n* Proactive signature cache eviction\r\n* Improved support for single-party Schnorr signatures\r\n* Ticket exhaustion prevention\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server such as:\r\n  * A new method to retrieve the current treasury balance\r\n  * A new method to query treasury spend transaction vote details\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the [voting process](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/) in Decred, all code needed in order to support a decentralized treasury is already included in this release, however it will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the decentralized treasury work was originally proposed and approved for initial implementation via the following Politeia proposal:\r\n\r\n- [Decentralized Treasury Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f)\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposal (DCP) describes the proposed changes in detail and provides a full technical specification:\r\n\r\n- [DCP0006](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0006/dcp-0006.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.6.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous versions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the database and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\nThe database migration typically takes about 5 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 2 to 4 minutes on SSDs.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Decentralized Treasury Vote\r\n\r\nA new vote with the id `treasury` is now available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to fully decentralize treasury spending so that it is controlled by the stakeholders via ticket voting.\r\n\r\nSee the initial [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Aggregate Fee Block Template Transaction Selection (Child Pays For Parent)\r\n\r\nThe transactions that are selected for inclusion in block templates that Proof-of-Work miners solve now prioritize the overall fees of the entire transaction ancestor graph.\r\n\r\nThis is beneficial for both miners and end users as it:\r\n\r\n- Helps maximize miner profit by ensuring that unconfirmed transaction chains with higher aggregate fees are given priority over others with lower aggregate fees\r\n- Provides a mechanism for users to increase the priority of an unconfirmed transaction by spending its outputs with another transaction that pays higher fees\r\n\r\nThis is commonly referred to as Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) as the spending (\"child\") transaction is able to increase the priority of the spent (\"parent\") transaction.\r\n\r\n### HTTPS Seeding\r\n\r\nThe initial bootstrap process that contacts seeders to discover other nodes to connect to now uses a REST-based API over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nThis change will be imperceptible for most users, with the exception that it accelerates the process of finding suitable candidate nodes that support desired services, particularly in the case of recently-introduced services that have not yet achieved widespread adoption on the network.\r\n\r\nThe following are some key benefits of HTTPS seeders over the previous DNS-based seeders:\r\n\r\n- Support for non-standard ports\r\n- Advertisement of supported service\r\n- Better scalability both in terms of network load and new features\r\n- Native support for TLS-secured communication channels\r\n- Native support for proxies which allows the use of anonymous overlay networks such as Tor and I2P\r\n- No need for a large DNSSEC dependency surface\r\n- Uses better audited infrastructure\r\n- More secure\r\n- Increases flexibility\r\n\r\n### Signature Validation And Other Crypto Operation Optimizations\r\n\r\nThe underlying crypto code has been reworked to significantly improve its execution speed and reduce the number of memory allocations.  While this has more benefits than enumerated here, probably the most important ones for most stakeholders are:\r\n\r\n- Improved vote times since blocks and transactions propagate more quickly throughout the network\r\n- The initial sync process is around 15% faster\r\n\r\n### Proactive Signature Cache Eviction\r\n\r\nSignature cache entries that are nearly guaranteed to no longer be useful are now immediately and proactively evicted resulting in overall faster validation during steady state operation due to fewer cache misses.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the cache is to avoid double checking signatures that are already known to be valid.\r\n\r\n### Orphan Transaction Relay Policy Refinement\r\n\r\nTransactions that spend outputs which are not known to nodes relaying them, known as orphan transactions, now have the same size restrictions applied to them as standard non-orphan transactions.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that transactions chains are not artificially hindered from relaying regardless of the order they are received.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep memory usage of the now potentially larger orphan transactions under control, more intelligent orphan eviction has been implemented and the maximum number of allowed orphans before random eviction occurs has been lowered.\r\n\r\nThese changes, in conjunction with other related changes, mean that nodes are better about orphan transaction management and thus missing ancestors will typically either be broadcast or mined fairly quickly resulting in fewer overall orphans and smaller actual run-time orphan pools.\r\n\r\n### Ticket Exhaustion Prevention\r\n\r\nMining templates that would lead to the chain becoming unrecoverable due to inevitable ticket exhaustion will no longer be generated.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily aimed at the testing networks, but it could also theoretically affect the main network in some far future if the demand for tickets were to ever dry up for some unforeseen reason.\r\n\r\n### New Initial State Protocol Messages (`getinitstate`/`initstate`)\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a pair of peer-to-peer protocol messages named `getinitstate` and `initstate` which support querying one or more pieces of information that are useful to acquire when a node first connects in a consolidated fashion.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the aforementioned information are the mining state as of the current tip block and, with the introduction of the decentralized treasury, any outstanding treasury spend transactions that are being voted on.\r\n\r\n### Mining State Protocol Messages Deprecated (`getminings`/`minings`)\r\n\r\nDue to the addition of the previously-described initial state peer-to-peer protocol messages, the `getminings` and `minings` protocol messages are now deprecated.  Use the new `getinitstate` and `initstate` messages with the `headblocks` and `headblockvotes` state types instead.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\nThe RPC server version as of this release is 6.2.0.\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Balance Query RPC (`gettreasurybalance`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettreasurybalance` is now available to query the current balance of the decentralized treasury.  Please note that this requires the decentralized treasury vote to pass and become active, so it will return an appropriate error indicating the decentralized treasury is inactive until that time.\r\n\r\nSee the [gettreasurybalance JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettreasurybalance) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Spend Vote Query RPC (`gettreasuryspendvotes`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettreasuryspendvotes` is now available to query vote information about one or more treasury spend transactions.  Please note that this requires the decentralized treasury vote to pass and become active to produce a meaningful result since treasury spend transactions are invalid until that time.\r\n\r\nSee the [gettreasuryspendvotes JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettreasuryspendvotes) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Force Mining Template Regeneration RPC (`regentemplate`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `regentemplate` is now available which can be used to force the current background block template to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nSee the [regentemplate JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#regentemplate) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Unspent Transaction Output Set Query RPC (`gettxoutsetinfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettxoutsetinfo` is now available which can be used to retrieve statistics about the current global set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\r\n\r\nSee the [gettxoutsetinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettxoutsetinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Peer Information Query RPC (`getpeerinfo`)\r\n\r\nThe results of the `getpeerinfo` RPC are now sorted by the `id` field.\r\n\r\nSee the [getpeerinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getpeerinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Enforced Results Limit on Transaction Search RPC (`searchrawtransactions`)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of transactions returned by a single request to the `searchrawtransactions` RPC is now limited to 10,000 transactions.  This far exceeds the number of results for all typical cases; however, for the rare cases where it does not, the caller can make use of the `skip` parameter in subsequent requests to access additional data if they require access to more results.\r\n\r\nSee the [searchrawtransactions JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#searchrawtransactions) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Index Status Fields on Info Query RPC (`getinfo`)\r\n\r\nThe results of the `getinfo` RPC now include `txindex` and `addrindex` fields that specify whether or not the respective indexes are active.\r\n\r\nSee the [getinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n### Version 1 Block Filters Deprecated\r\n\r\nSupport for version 1 block filters is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in the next release.   Use [version 2 block filters](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters) with their associated [block header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-header-commitments) and [inclusion proof](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#verifying-commitment-root-inclusion-proofs) instead.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 616 commits from 17 contributors which total to 526 files changed, 63090 additional lines of code, and 26279 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.5.2...release-v1.6.0).\r\n\r\nSee the [dcrd's own release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.6.0) for a categorized breakdown of all commits since the last release.\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (Alphabetical Order)\r\n\r\n- Brian Stafford\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- David Hill\r\n- degeri\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- Joe Gruffins\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- Julian Yap\r\n- Marco Peereboom\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Matt Hawkins\r\n- Ryan Riley\r\n- Ryan Staudt\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n- Youssef Boukenken\r\n- zhizhongzhiwai\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrwallet-v160\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.6.0\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on adding support for the decentralized Decred treasury, improved SPV syncing with version 2 committed filters, and client support for the new privacy-conscious VSP implementation to make mixed VSP ticketbuying viable.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Decentralized Treasury\r\n\r\n* Support for the decentralized treasury consensus change is added.  Two new JSON-RPC methods `sendtotreasury` and `spendfromtreasury` are added, to send to and spend from value in the treasury, respectively.  The vote version and current agendas have been updated to allow stakeholders to vote on the activation of the decentralized treasury.\r\n\r\n### SPV Mode\r\n\r\n* Version 2 committed filters are now used, rather than the previous version 1 filters.  These filters are consensus validated by proof-of-work miners as part of the commitments in the block header.  Version 2 filters are smaller and also do not require knowledge of the exact outputs spent, but rather only the previous output script (or address).\r\n\r\n* The `fundrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method is now directly implemented by dcrwallet, rather than delegating this method to dcrd through RPC passthrough. This allows the method to be usable under SPV mode.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.GetRawCFilters` gRPC method was added to query the wallet-stored version 2 committed filter for specified blocks.\r\n\r\n* Both a `getpeerinfo` JSON-RPC method and `WalletService.GetPeerInfo` gRPC method were implemented to provide peer info in SPV mode.  The JSON-RPC method continues to return results from a connected dcrd when syncing in RPC mode.\r\n\r\n* A `sendrawtransaction` implementation has been added to the JSON-RPC server. This allows arbitrary transactions to be published under SPV mode.\r\n\r\n### Staking\r\n\r\n* A client for the new vspd server was added, and dcrwallet supports this client functionality from both the ticket autobuyer and through various gRPC methods.\r\n\r\n* A `ticketinfo` JSON-RPC method was added to provide detailed status information regarding all tickets from the wallet.\r\n\r\n* Vote preferences may now be specified on a per-ticket basis with added optional parameters to the `setvotechoice` JSON-RPC method.  This feature is used by the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n* The `stakepooluserinfo` JSON-RPC method has been reintroduced, after being removed from prior releases.  This is used by the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n* Unpublished transactions are now supported.  When an unpublished transaction is saved to the database, the outputs it spends are tallied in balance results and are not spendable by other transactions.  Unpublishd transactions will not be automatically rebroadast to the network when the wallet starts up and begins syncing.  Unpublished transactions are used to record transactions paying vspd fees prior to the vspd instance accepting the client's ticket request.\r\n\r\n* A `--manualtickets` flag was added to the application config.  This setting disables discovering any tickets from the network syncing, instead requiring any tickets to be manually added to the wallet using `addtransaction`.  This feature is used by the new vspd server to avoid voting on unprocessed tickets which used a vspd voting address.  The current state of this setting is reported in the `walletinfo` JSON-RPC result.\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` gRPC method gained a `dont_sign_tx` parameter to support unsigned ticket purchasing and eventual hardware wallet signing.\r\n\r\n* Ticket purchasing will now attempt to buy fewer tickets than requested when there is a low balance, either due to a bad estimate of how many tickets could be purchased, or due to outputs being reserved to pay the fees for the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n### Mixing\r\n\r\n* An `AccountMixerService` was added to the gRPC server to perform CoinShuffle++ mixing on all funds received by an account.\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` method gained support for specifying CoinShuffle++ options for mixed ticket buying.\r\n\r\n* The `getcoinjoinsbyacct` JSON-RPC method and `WalletService.GetCoinjoinOutputspByAcct` gRPC methods were added to discover probable CoinJoin transactions and report them by account.\r\n\r\n* Outputs which are being mixed are now locked to prevent accidental spending before the mix completes.\r\n\r\n* Mix denominations above the ticket price are now avoided when mixing large value outputs.  This improves pairing with the large volume of mixes occurring from ticket buying, as there are many pairings occurring at the standard denominations below the ticket price to mix CoinJoin change outputs.\r\n\r\n* Mixed ticketbuying using the autobuyer will now default to buy one ticket per client connection if the limit is unset.  Setting a larger limit will continue to buy at most limit number of tickets per client connection.\r\n\r\n### Wallet Encryption and Authentication\r\n\r\n* A `walletpassphrasechange` JSON-RPC method was added to modify the wallet's public data encryption passphrase.  Changing to the default insecure value \"public\" effectively removes any prompts for the public passphrase at startup.\r\n\r\n* Accounts are now able to be encrypted using separate, per-account passphrases. Unlocking an account only provides access to that account's private keys, and no others.  Account passphrases may be set using the `setaccountpassphrase` JSON-RPC method, and locked and unlocked by the `unlockaccount` and `lockaccount` methods.\r\n\r\n* JSON-RPC clients may now be authenticated using TLS client certificates, and this authentication is now required for the gRPC server.  The feature may be enabled for JSON-RPC by using the `--jsonrpcauthtype=clientcert` config flag. Client certificates read from a `clients.pem` file in the application directory are trusted by default, and this file may be modified by the `--clientcafile` config flag.  Additionally, an `--issueclientcert` flag is provided which causes the wallet to issue and send an ephemeral client certificate and key over the TX pipe to the parent process which forked dcrwallet.  Client certificates may be generated by the `gencerts` tool, which is now part of the Decred CLI distribution.\r\n\r\n* gRPC methods to lock and unlock the wallet's global keys and individually-encrypted accounts are now added, and the passphrase in all requests which required an unlocked wallet are now optional.  As the gRPC server now requires client authentication, there is no a risk of an unauthenticated client from quickly hitting an already-unlocked wallet or account and using private keys it should not otherwise have access to.\r\n\r\n* The scrypt KDF used for wallet encryption keys now defaults to weaker parameters on simnet.  This is primarily done for quicker unit tests, but will also affect real dcrwallet simnet instances by requiring less time and memory to derive keys.\r\n\r\n### Other Improvements\r\n\r\n* A `createsignature` JSON-RPC method was introduced, analogous to the gRPC `WalletService.CreateSignature` method.\r\n\r\n* A `discoverusage` JSON-RPC method was introduced, which triggers the same address and account discovery as performed on startup when there are new blocks available.  However, this method is more general purpose and is useful when correcting issues with prior discoveries, at it allows specifying the exact starting blocks and a BIP0044 gap limit to use.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.SignHashes` gRPC method was added to sign an arbitrary number of 32-byte hashes.  This method was used by the now-defunct TumbleBit implementation.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.Spender` gRPC method was added to query the transaction and input index which spends a wallet output.\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.TransactionNotifications` gRPC method now provides more details about the block headers which were detached during a reorganize, rather than only their hashes.\r\n\r\n* An `addtransaction` JSON-RPC method was added, allowing transactions to be manually added to the wallet, mined in a specified block, without discovering the transaction through the network.\r\n\r\n* A `NetworkService.GetRawBlock` gRPC method was added to fetch raw blocks using the wallet's peer-to-peer implementation.\r\n\r\n* An optional account parameter was added to the `listunspent` and `listlockunspent` JSON-RPC methods to filter results for a particular account.\r\n\r\n* The `listunspent` JSON-RPC method now includes the hex encoding of a redeem script when the output is P2SH and the redeem script is known.\r\n\r\n* Peer-to-peer seeding is now performed over an HTTPS API rather than DNS. This improves reliability (HTTPS is authenticated), as well as greater control of filtering results by various URL parameters.\r\n\r\n* The LOGFLAGS environment variable may now include a UTC flag to cause the wallet to always log with UTC timestamps, regardless of the current system timezone.\r\n\r\n* Many log messages were added, removed, or rewritten to better reflect the operational state of the application.\r\n\r\n* Imported scripts are now recorded in plain text and the wallet does not need to be unlocked to retrieve the full script for the P2SH address.  This change is made under the assumption that imported redeem scripts should not be secrets themselves, but still require a signature check at the very least.\r\n\r\n* Importing an already-existing redeem script from the `importscript` JSON-RPC method no longer starts a rescan.\r\n\r\n* Output locking no longer considers differences between the regular and stake transaction trees.\r\n\r\n* Wallet setup may now be performed by providing answers to the prompts from piped output or a redirected file, as long as the passphrase is provided using the `--pass` flag.\r\n\r\n* Newly created simnet wallets now always use the SLIP0044 coin type.  This ensures that the printed mining address during the creation process will not become invalid after a coin type upgrade from the legacy to the SLIP0044 coin type following address discovery.\r\n\r\n* The latest peer-to-peer protocol version is now supported.  The `miningstate` and `initstate` messages which are expected in this version are replied to with empty responses.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* A memory leak of requests and responses made to a dcrd websocket server was plugged.\r\n\r\n* Imported xpub accounts no longer produce errors while trying to read the account's xpriv.\r\n\r\n* Created transactions are now checked against the current network's maximum transaction size limit, to avoid creating transactions which are too long for consensus-validating nodes to accept.\r\n\r\n* An out-of-bounds panic seen during address discovery of imported xpub accounts was corrected.\r\n\r\n* A data race during the subscribing of transaction notifications involving wallet addresses was fixed.\r\n\r\n* The `getaddressesbyaccount` JSON-RPC method now returns results for the imported account.\r\n\r\n* The database implementation used by dcrwallet (bbolt) was fixed and updated to remove invalid usage of Go's unsafe programming features.\r\n\r\n* The peer-to-peer implementation now allows the same block to be requested concurrently by the same peer.  This fixes some occasional errors which stopped the SPV syncer under normal wallet usage.\r\n\r\n* The autobuyer will no longer mix the change account when the wallet is not up to date with other peers on the network.  This avoids submitting mix requests involving outputs which may have already been spent.\r\n\r\n* A memory leak of wallet address private keys when operating a wallet that remained always unlocked was plugged.\r\n\r\n* The stakebase script found in vote transactions is now included when creating the unsigned vote, rather than during signing.  This fix ensures that the correct stakebase script for the active network is always used, instead of filling in the script for a different network.\r\n\r\n* UTXO selection is now aware of output maturity and will not include immature outputs.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0).\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors\r\n\r\nIn alphabetical order:\r\n\r\n- Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- Brian Stafford\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- David Hill\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- Julian Yap\r\n- Kifen\r\n- Marco Peereboom\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Matt Hawkins\r\n- Mike Belopuhov\r\n- peterzen\r\n- Victor Oliveira\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v160\" />\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.6.0\r\n\r\nThis release includes two major functionality improvements for staking and privacy.  The past privacy improvements that were available for dcrwallet are now implemented in decrediton for ticket purchasing and account mixing. Accountless VSP ticket purchasing has been added as well that should greatly simplify the staking process and increase privacy.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous graphical improvements and bug fixes that will hopefully lead to a smoother UX and reduce support questions and intervention.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n### Privacy\r\n\r\nWe have added a new menu item that covers Privacy and Security tools. Users should go there to 'enable' privacy on their wallets.  This enabling process is not done automatically yet, mostly due to required user intervention with private passphrase entry to create needed mixed and unmixed accounts.  Hopefully in the future we will add this step to the wallet launcher.\r\n\r\nOnce enabled, the privacy page will transform into an account mixer form that allows users to mix funds from the unmixed account into the mixed account.  To follow what dcrwallet is doing, there is a log window below.  In the future, we may add better messaging that will allow updates to the mixing process instead of just showing raw logs.\r\n\r\nOnce privacy is enabled, spending to external addresses is only allowed from the mixed account.  This is to ensure privacy is not broken by spending from any unmixed account.  Additionally, it is not allowed to manually generate addresses in the mixed account, since only funds that have been properly mixed should be allowed to end up there.\r\n\r\nThere is a checkbox that allows users to forgo the external spending restriction.  There is a dominant warning and users must confirm the risks they are imposing by spending from unmixed accounts.\r\n\r\n### Accountless VSP Staking with Optional Mixing\r\n\r\nThe new accountless VSP ticket purchasing process has been added. Now there is no need to create an account at VSP's website, add its API key in Decrediton and backup redeem scripts.  Users may now simply go to the tickets page, select the VSP they'd like to use and the number of tickets to purchase.\r\n\r\nThis new way of staking is more private even without mixing enabled since it eliminates address reuse and the use of email. It is recommended that users migrate their tickets to this new system sooner. Read more [here](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/02/A-More-Private-Way-to-Stake/).\r\n\r\nIf privacy is enabled, the process of purchasing a ticket requires there to be a successful mix to occur.  Mix sessions happen every 20 minutes and participating in a single session is usually (though not always) sufficient.  If successful, the mixed split ticket funding transaction, the ticket, and the ticket's fee, should all be seen on the overview.  But as you may notice, the ticket's fee is not yet broadcast onto the network by the VSP until the ticket has been confirmed by 6 blocks.  If any tickets have missing or errored fees, the user will be notified if they try to close Decrediton.\r\n\r\n## Other Updates\r\n\r\n* Menu was reorganized and optimized to accomodate added tabs and tools.  Since we are quickly adding functionality we need to make sure the left-hand sidebar menu is as efficient as possible without becoming bloated with items. Hopefully the current layout allows for more growth for tools and functionality.\r\n\r\n* Peer count is now shown on the side bar.  This should alleviate issues where people don't know why their transactions aren't getting mined.\r\n\r\n* An SPV indicator has been added to the sidebar.  Previously there was no way of understanding what mode the wallet was running in without looking at Settings page.\r\n\r\n* Unmined transactions are now able to be abandoned under transaction details. This should fix issues that people previously had unminable transactions \"stuck\" in their wallet.  If the network doesn't know about the transaction, then they should be able to be abandoned and the funds unreserved.\r\n\r\n* A full refactor of components into functional components is now mostly complete.  This should now allow for more agile development moving forward.\r\n\r\n## Code Contributors\r\n\r\nIn alphabetical order:\r\n\r\n- Alex Yocom-Piatt\r\n- Amir Massarwa\r\n- artikozel\r\n- bgptr\r\n- David Hill\r\n- degeri\r\n- Fernando Guisso\r\n- Guilherme Marques\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- JoeGruffins\r\n- Jonathan Zeppettini\r\n- karamble\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Nicola Larosa\r\n- Piotr Delikat\r\n- Thiago F.

Users should be mindful of the total amount of funds committed to dcrlnd wallets and channels._\r\n\r\nThis is a major dcrlnd release including significant amount of changes.\r\n\r\nThis release brings dcrlnd in line with the upstream lnd [release v0.11.1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.1-beta) and also includes ports for versions [v0.11.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.0-beta), [v0.10.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta) and [v0.9.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta).\r\n\r\n## Vulnerability Fixes\r\n\r\nThis release includes fixes for [CVE-2020-26896](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002857.html) and [CVE-2020-895](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002858.html) made in the upstream lnd project. Fixes for these were released in upstream versions v0.11.0 and v0.10.0 respectively and the underlying issues were fully disclosed in Oct 20, 2020.\r\n\r\nAdditional context for the vulnerabilities and its impact in LN implementations, written by the original discoverer can be found [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002859.html) and [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002855.html)\r\n\r\n## Database Migrations\r\n\r\nThis release contains database migrations for the new TLV encoding of invoices, payment address indexing and close summary information. Old versions of dcrlnd cannot use the new database version once these migrations are applied.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThe major Decred-specific feature introduced in this release is the ability to run a dcrlnd instance connected to a dcrwallet running in SPV mode. This is useful mostly for Decrediton users that will now have the option to run dcrlnd even when their wallet is using the SPV configuration.\r\n\r\n### Node Syncing Config\r\n\r\nCLI users now have two options for the `--node` argument:\r\n\r\n- `--node=dcrd` instructs dcrlnd to connect to a dcrd instance for on-chain operations.\r\n- `--node=dcrw` instructs dcrlnd to use the underlying dcrwallet instance for on-chain operations.\r\n\r\nWhen using `--node=dcrd`, the `--dcrd.`-namespaced options should be used to configure the connection to the underlying dcrd node.\r\n\r\nWhen using `--node=dcrw`, either the `--dcrd.`-namespaced options should be used, in order to use an _embedded_ dcrwallet instance (that is, dcrwallet runs automatically inside dcrlnd) **or** the `--dcrw.`-namespaced options should be used to configure a __remote__ dcrwallet instance.\r\n\r\nNote that SPV mode is only supported on remote dcrwallet instances.\r\n\r\nFor hub nodes (that is, nodes that are online most of the time and offer the ability to receive open channel requests) the recommended config setting is to use embedded wallets with a dcrd instance.\r\n\r\n### Wumbo Channel Support\r\n\r\nThis release adapts the [Wumbo](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4429) feature for the realities of Decred. Wumbo channel support can be enabled by running dcrlnd with `--protocol.wumbo-channels` and has a global maximum channel size of 500 DCR.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Upstream Changes\r\n\r\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the relevant upstream changes that were ported to dcrlnd. These include changes from the upstream [v0.9](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/74), [v0.10](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/99) and [v0.11](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) lines. Please refer to the respective upstream releases for additional information.\r\n\r\n- Multi Path Payment (MPP) support so that a single payment can be split among multiple channels.\r\n- Track payments with a new Payment Address field.\r\n- Additional TLV data sent in payments, which allows creating new use cases to deliver payload data via LN payments.\r\n- Keysend payment experiment which allows spontaneous payments without the need for a precreated invoice.\r\n- Upfront shutdown script support to enforce channel closure to pay to pre-configured addresses.\r\n- HTLC Interception API to allow creation of custom payment forwarding engines.\r\n- Additional data in Channel Close Summaries.\r\n- Add ability to limit max remote pending HTLC amount during channel opening.\r\n- Anchor outputs experimental feature.\r\n- External channel funding experimental feature.\r\n- Healthchecks to ensure adequate operating conditions of the node\r\n- Several bug fixes throughout the app.\r\n\r\n## Porting Effort\r\n\r\nA total of 450 upstream PRs were considered for inclusion. The list of of PRs can be found in the acompanying [upstream-prs.csv](/docs/upstream-prs.csv) doc.\r\n\r\n## Decred Contributors (Alphabetical Order)\r\n\r\n- Fernando Guisso\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Ole Andre Birkedal\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work included in this release is from features and bugfixes performed by the contributors to the upstream [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) project that were ported to Decred.\r\n\r\nWe wish to sincerely thank them for providing such a high quality project and hope we can continue to contribute in building a large scale and cross-coin LN ecosystem.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrdex-v014\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrdex v0.1.4\r\n\r\nThis patch release makes a number of small UI improvments, including showing the user's account ID on the settings page, focusing password field, and colorizing various buy/sell elements, and fixes several bugs.  The main bug fixes deal with wallet settings changes, deposit address revalidation, Decred withdraws working for the full balance, and historical order and match display.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [initial release (v0.1.0) notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/releases/tag/release-v0.1.0) for important information and instructions.\r\n\r\n## Client (dexc)\r\n\r\n### Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n- The account ID for each configured DEX server is now displayed on the settings page.  When not logged in, there is a placeholder that says to login to display the account ID. ([1a5c070](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1a5c070196ab7899214b524a9c681168fbdcfd75))\r\n- Focus password field in order dialogs.

([83b07cd](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/83b07cd08a8a7ecced012335092c0f196d7fcfb0))\r\n- The registration fee address is no longer logged if there is a funding error since there is nothing a user can do with the address other than shoot themselves in the foot and send to it manually.  Registration fee payment should only be done via the app. ([dc67cdb](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/dc67cdbb09fe6e296164da0b916ab8a1744912f6))\r\n- Wallet balances are updated on all wallet settings changes. ([8ff4d94](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/8ff4d943d69182b9866faf6637e9e3c17e97db69))\r\n- Wallet sync status is more consistently checked on wallet (re)connect events, and continually check sync status on RPC errors as it is common for node/wallet startup to initially error and then start reporting status (e.g. bitcoind's \"verifying blocks...\" error while starting up). ([1c9ca02](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/1c9ca02db974cbd76dceac5b29a825b5cc805c84), [53194c6](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/53194c615ee3179c2c6ec08278a41bbd9b234634))\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix changing wallet settings possibly interrupting active swaps. ([f0a304f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f0a304f7ea74af3ce75f3edc1cbb3f4f524f1c84))\r\n- Fix a case where a wallet can become unlockable without restarting dexc if dexc were started with both active orders and an unlocked wallet. ([f8c47a1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/f8c47a163387b8c63201f2f9ad1053a205e6203f))\r\n- Fix duplicate notify_fee requests that resulted from multiple fee coin waiters being created for the same coin.

([a347b0f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/a347b0f34d0fd143b566b59588cda4f86f1b218b))\r\n- Wallet deposit addresses are validated and more often refreshed whenever the wallet is connected ([c3990c7](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/c3990c765f7a7de2017da08c29fb9fae8853a522), [6a66a1c](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/6a66a1cb7701ed6d6e7187231a46ad1f2a74a782))\r\n- Correctly handle chain sync status when in initial block download state, but blocks are up-to-date with headers. This is only possible in practice with simnet. ([3523de1](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/3523de11b270fed9162c0b2bd8aee2333fe2e8f6))\r\n- Fix DCR withdraws in various cases. ([d0ba1e5](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/d0ba1e5dbcdc063c8fb4abf95725c67174868291))\r\n- Allow dexc to shutdown without hanging if a wallet was unexpectedly shutdown first. ([7321c36](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/7321c364297b8f5c0dd85cf798902b169bd3eebf))\r\n- When loading active matches on login, correctly skip adding cancel order matches to the trades map.

([4bed3e2](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/4bed3e2f55f97cac45ca30cf7ad4faac94d20604))\r\n\r\n## Developer\r\n\r\n- Simnet harnesses are quicker to start, being based on archives, and more well funded. ([0de8945](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/0de89456c129bc39a200e816fb660f216a7d41e2))\r\n- Update simnet trade tests for current wallet unlocking system and more well funded harnesses. ([e198b1f](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/commit/e198b1f095be8cad51c8e49604c873ed2ac4f02d))\r\n\r\n## Server (dcrdex)\r\n\r\nCreate a fee rate scaling administrative endpoint.

The software will verify this for you in the next patch release.\r\n- **Never shutdown your wallets with dexc running**. When shutting down, always stop dexc before stopping your wallets.\r\n- If you have to restart dexc with active orders or swaps, you must \r\n**immediately login again with your app password when dexc starts up**. The next patch release wil inform you on startup if this is required.\r\n- There is a ~10 minute \"inaction timeout\" when it becomes your client's turn to broadcast a transaction, so be sure not to stop dexc or lose connectivity for longer than that or you risk having your active orders and swaps/matches revoked. If you do have to restart dexc, remember to login as soon as you start it up again.\r\n- Only one dexc process should be running for a given user account at any time. For example, if you have identical dexc configurations on two computers and you run and login on both, neither dexc instance will be adequately connected to successfully negotiate swaps. Also note that order history is not synchronized between different installations at this time.\r\n- Your DEX server accounts exist inside the dexc.db file, the location of which depends on operating system, but is typically in ~/.dexc/mainnet/dexc.db or %HOMEPATH%\\Local\\Dexc\\mainnet\\dexc.db.  Do not delete this account or you will need to register again at whatever server was configured in it.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis release of DCRDEX includes a client program called dexc and a server called dcrdex. Users run their own wallets (e.g. dcrwallet or bitcoind), which dexc works with to perform trades via atomic swaps. dcrdex facilitates price discovery by maintaining an order book for one or more markets, and coordinates atomic swaps directly between pairs of traders that are matched according to their orders. The server is generally run on a remote system, but anyone may operate a dcrdex server.\r\n\r\nThis release supports Decred, Bitcoin, and Litecoin.\r\n\r\n### Client (dexc)\r\n\r\n- Provides a browser-based interface, which is self-hosted by the dexc program, for configuring wallets, displaying market data such as order books, and placing and monitoring orders.\r\n- Communicates with any user-specified dcrdex server.\r\n- Funds orders and executes atomic swaps by controlling the external wallets (dcrwallet, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Server (dcrdex)\r\n\r\n- Accepts orders from clients who prove ownership of on-chain coins to fund the order.\r\n- Books and matches orders with an epoch-based matching algorithm.\r\n- Relays swap data between matched parties, allowing the clients to perform the transactions themselves directly on the assets' blockchains.\r\n- Has a one-time nominal (e.g. 1 DCR) registration fee, which acts as an anti-spam measure and to incentivize completing swaps.\r\n- Enforces the code of community conduct by suspending accounts that repeatedly violate the rules.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Markets and Orders\r\n\r\nThe server maintains a familiar market of buy and sell orders, each with a quantity and a rate. A market is defined by a pair of assets, where one asset is referred to as the **base asset**. For example, in the \"DCR-BTC\" market, DCR is the base asset and BTC is known as the **quote asset**. A market is also specified by a **lot size**, which is a quantity of the base asset. Order quantity must be a multiple of lot size, with the exception of market buy orders that are necessarily specified in units of the quote asset that is offered in the trade. The intent of a client to execute an atomic swap of one asset for another is communicated by submitting orders to a specific market on a dcrdex server.\r\n\r\nThe two types of trade orders are market orders, which have a quantity but no rate, and limit orders, which also specify a rate. Limit orders also have a \r\n**time-in-force** that specifies if the order should be allowed to become booked or if it should only be allowed to match with other orders when it is initially processed. The time-in-force options are referred to as \"standing\" or \"immediate\", where standing indicates the order is allowed to become booked while immediate restricts that order to being a taker order by only allowing a match when it is initially processed.\r\n\r\nThe following image is an example order submission dialog from a testnet DCR-BTC market with a 40 DCR lot size that demonstrates limit order buying 2 lots (80 DCR) at a rate of 0.001207 BTC/DCR using a standing time-in-force to allow the order to become booked if it is not filled:\r\n\r\n![submit order dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9373513/97030709-c8fd9500-1524-11eb-8bd0-3eb4cf95e8c8.png)\r\n\r\nChecking the \"Match for one epoch only\" box above specifies that the limit order's time-in-force should be immediate, while unchecking it allows the order to be booked if it does not match with another order at first. The concept of epochs is described in the [Epoch](#epochs) section.\r\n\r\n### Order Funding\r\n\r\nSince orders must be funded by coins from the user's wallets, placing an order \"locks\" an amount in the relevant wallet. For example, a buy order on the DCR-BTC market marks a certain quantity of BTC as locked with the user's wallet. (This involves no transactions or movement of funds.) This amount will be shown in the \"locked\" row of the Balances table.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the amount that is locked by the order may be \r\n**larger than the order quantity** since the \"locked\" amount is dependent on the size of the UTXO (for UTXO-based assets like Bitcoin and Decred) that is reserved for use as an input to the swap transaction, where the amount that does not enter the contract goes in a change address. This is no different from when you make a regular transaction, however because the input UTXOs are locked in advance of broadcasting the actual transaction that spends them, you will see the amount locked in the wallet until the swap actually takes place.\r\n\r\nDepending on the asset, there may be a wallet setting on the Wallets page to pre-size funding UTXOs to avoid this over-locking, but (1) it involves an extra transaction that pays to yourself before placing the order, which has on-chain transaction fees that may be undesirable on chains like BTC, and (2) it is only applied for limit orders with standing time-in-force since the the UTXOs are only locked until the swap transaction is broadcasted, which is relatively brief for taker-only orders that are never booked.\r\n\r\n### Epochs\r\n\r\nAn important concept with DCRDEX is that newly submitted orders are processed in short windows of time called **epochs**, the length of which is part of the server's market configuration, but is typically on the order of 10 seconds. When a valid order is received by the server, it enters into the pool of epoch orders before it is matched and/or booked. The motivation for this approach is described in detail in the DCRDEX specification. The Your Orders table will show the status of such orders as \"epoch\" until they are matched at the end of the epoch, as described in the next section.\r\n\r\nOrder cancellation requests are also processed in the epoch with trade (market/limit) orders since a cancellation is actually a type of order. However, from the user's perspective, cancelling an order is simply a matter clicking the cancel icon for one of their booked orders.\r\n\r\n### Matching\r\n\r\nWhen the end of an epoch is reached, the orders it includes are then matched with the orders that are already on the book. A key concept of DCRDEX order matching is a deterministic algorithm for shuffling the epoch orders so that it is difficult for a user to game the system. To perform the shuffling of the closed epoch prior to matching, clients with orders in the epoch must provide to the server a special value for each of their orders called a **preimage**, which must correspond to another value that was provided when the order was initially submitted called the **commitment**. This is done automatically by dexc, requiring no action from the user.\r\n\r\nIf an order fails to match with another order, it will become either \r\n**booked** or **executed** with no part of the order filled. The Your Orders table displays the current status and remaining quantity of each of a user's orders. If an order does match with another trade order, the order status will become **settling**, and atomic swap negotiation begins.\r\n\r\n### Settlement\r\n\r\nWhen maker orders (on the book) are matched with taker orders from an epoch, the atomic swap sequence begins. No action is required from either user during the process.\r\n\r\nIn the current atomic swap protocol, the **maker initiates** by broadcasting a transaction with a swap contract on the relevant asset network, and informing the server of the transaction and the full contract. The server audits the contract, and if it is successfully validated, the information is relayed to the taker, who independently audits the contract to ensure it meets their expectations. The transaction containing the maker's swap contract must then be mined and reach the **swap confirmation requirement**, which is also a market setting. For example, Bitcoin might require 3 confirmations while other chains like Litecoin might be considerably more. When the required number of confirmations is reached, the **taker participates** by broadcasting a transaction with their swap contract and informing the server. Again, the server and the counterparty audit the contract and wait for that asset's swap confirmation requirement. When the required confirmations are reached, the \r\n**maker redeems** the taker's contract and informs the server of the redemption transaction. This is the end of the process for the maker, as the redemption spends the taker's contract, paying to an address controlled by the maker. The server relays the maker's redeem data to the taker, and the \r\n**taker redeems** immediately, ending the swap.\r\n\r\nThe Order Details page shows each match associated with an order. For example, a match where the user was the taker is shown below with links to block explorers for each of the transactions described above. The maker will have their redemption listed, but not the taker's.\r\n\r\n![match details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9373513/97028559-eda43d80-1521-11eb-9ab6-2e0b21df584d.png)\r\n\r\nOrders may be partially filled in increments of the lot size. Hence a single order may have more than one match (and thus swap) associated with it, each of which will be shown on the Order Details page.\r\n\r\nWallet balances will change during swap negotiation. When the client broadcasts their swap contract, the amount locked in that contract will go into the \"locked\" row for the asset that funded the order. When the counterparty redeems their contract, that amount will be reduced by the contract amount, and the user will redeem the counterparty contract, thus adding to the balance of the other asset. This is the essence of the atomic swap. Note that until the redemption transactions are confirmed, the redeemed amount may remain in the wallet's \"immature\" balance category, but this depends on the asset.\r\n\r\n### Revoked Matches\r\n\r\nWhile the atomic swap process requires no party to trust the other, a swap may be forced into an alternate path ending in one or both users refunding themselves by spending their own contract after the lock time expires. This happens when one of the parties fails to act in the expected time frame, an \r\n**inaction timeout**. When an inaction timeout occurs the following happens:\r\n\r\n- The match is revoked, and both parties are notified.\r\n- The at-fault user has their order revoked (if it was partially filled and still booked) and is notified.\r\n- The at-fault user has their score adjusted according to type of match failure. See below for descriptions of each type and the associated user score adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe general categories of match failures are:\r\n\r\n- `NoMakerSwap`: A match is made, but the maker does not initiate the swap. No transactions are created in this case.\r\n- `NoTakerSwap`: The maker (initiator) broadcasts their swap contract transaction and informs the server, but the taker (participant) fails to broadcast their swap contract and inform the server. The maker will automatically refund their contract when it expires after 20 hrs.\r\n- `NoMakerRedeem`: The taker broadcasts their swap and informs the server, but the maker does not redeem it. The taker will refund when their contract expires after 8 hrs. Note that the taker's client begins watching for an unannounced redeem of their contract by the maker, which reveals the secret and permits the taker to redeem as well, completing the swap although in a potentially extended time frame.\r\n- `NoTakerRedeem`: The maker redeems the taker's contract and informs the server, but the taker fails to redeem the maker's contract even though they can do so at any time. This case is not disruptive to the counterparty, and is only detrimental to the takers, so it is of minimal concern.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The *order* remaining amounts are still reduced at match time although they did not settle that portion of the order.\r\n\r\n### User Scoring\r\n\r\nUsers have an incentive to respond with their preimage for their submitted orders and to complete swaps as the match negotiation protocol specifies, and if they repeatedly fail to act as required, their account may be suspended. This may require either communicating an excusable reason for the issue to the server operator, or registering a new account. However, a reasonable scoring system is established to balance the need to deter intentional disruptions with the reality of unreliable consumer networks and other such technical issues.\r\n\r\nIn this release, there are two primary inaction violations that adjust a users score: (1) failure to respond with a preimage for an order when the epoch for that order is closed (preimage miss), and (2) swap negotiation resulting in match revocation as described in the [previous section](#revoked_matches).\r\n\r\nThe score threshold at which an account becomes suspended (ban score) is an operator set variable, but the default is 20.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment to the at-fault user's score depends on the match failure:\r\n\r\n| Match Outcome   | Points | Notes                                              |\r\n|-----------------|-------:|----------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `NoMakerSwap`   |      4 | book spoof, taker needs new order, no locked funds |\r\n| `NoTakerSwap`   |     11 | maker has contract stuck for 20 hrs                |\r\n| `NoMakerRedeem` |      7 | taker has contract stuck for 8 hrs                 |\r\n| `NoTakerRedeem` |      1 | counterparty not inconvenienced, only self         |\r\n| `Success`       |     -1 | offsets violations                                 |\r\n\r\nA preimage miss adds 2 points to the users score.\r\n\r\nThe above scoring system should be considered tentative while it is evaluated in the wild.\r\n\r\n### Order Size Limits\r\n\r\nThis release uses an experimental system to set the maximum order quantity based on their swap history. It is likely to change, but it is described in [PR #750](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex/pull/750).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Summary\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 473 pull requests comprising 506 commits from 12 contributors.\r\n\r\nContributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- Brian Stafford (@buck54321)\r\n- David Hill (@dajohi)\r\n- @degeri\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku (@dnldd)\r\n- Fernando Abolafio (@fernandoabolafio)\r\n- Joe Gruffins (@JoeGruffins)\r\n- Jonathan Chappelow (@chappjc)\r\n- Kevin Wilde (@kevinstl)\r\n- @song50119\r\n- Victor Oliveira (@vctt94)\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene (@itswisdomagain)\r\n- @zeoio\r\n\r\n(there is no previous release to which a diff can be made)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"v160-end\" />\r\n"}

v1.6.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd introduces a large number of updates.  Some of the key highlights are:\r\n\r\n* A new consensus vote agenda which allows the stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate support for a decentralized treasury\r\n* Aggregate fee transaction selection in block templates (Child Pays For Parent)\r\n* Improved peer discovery via HTTPS seeding with filtering capabilities\r\n* Major performance enhancements for signature validation and other cryptographic operations\r\n* Approximately 15% less overall resident memory usage\r\n* Proactive signature cache eviction\r\n* Improved support for single-party Schnorr signatures\r\n* Ticket exhaustion prevention\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server such as:\r\n  * A new method to retrieve the current treasury balance\r\n  * A new method to query treasury spend transaction vote details\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the [voting process](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview/) in Decred, all code needed in order to support a decentralized treasury is already included in this release, however it will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the decentralized treasury work was originally proposed and approved for initial implementation via the following Politeia proposal:\r\n- [Decentralized Treasury Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f)\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposal (DCP) describes the proposed changes in detail and provides a full technical specification:\r\n- [DCP0006](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0006/dcp-0006.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release even if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.6.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the software.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous versions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to downgrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the database and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\nThe database migration typically takes about 5 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 2 to 4 minutes on SSDs.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Decentralized Treasury Vote\r\n\r\nA new vote with the id `treasury` is now available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to fully decentralize treasury spending so that it is controlled by the stakeholders via ticket voting.\r\n\r\nSee the initial [Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Aggregate Fee Block Template Transaction Selection (Child Pays For Parent)\r\n\r\nThe transactions that are selected for inclusion in block templates that Proof-of-Work miners solve now prioritize the overall fees of the entire transaction ancestor graph.\r\n\r\nThis is beneficial for both miners and end users as it:\r\n\r\n- Helps maximize miner profit by ensuring that unconfirmed transaction chains with higher aggregate fees are given priority over others with lower aggregate fees\r\n- Provides a mechanism for users to increase the priority of an unconfirmed transaction by spending its outputs with another transaction that pays higher fees\r\n\r\nThis is commonly referred to as Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) as the spending (\"child\") transaction is able to increase the priority of the spent (\"parent\") transaction.\r\n\r\n### HTTPS Seeding\r\n\r\nThe initial bootstrap process that contacts seeders to discover other nodes to connect to now uses a REST-based API over HTTPS.\r\n\r\nThis change will be imperceptible for most users, with the exception that it accelerates the process of finding suitable candidate nodes that support desired services, particularly in the case of recently-introduced services that have not yet achieved widespread adoption on the network.\r\n\r\nThe following are some key benefits of HTTPS seeders over the previous DNS-based seeders:\r\n\r\n- Support for non-standard ports\r\n- Advertisement of supported service\r\n- Better scalability both in terms of network load and new features\r\n- Native support for TLS-secured communication channels\r\n- Native support for proxies which allows the use of anonymous overlay networks such as Tor and I2P\r\n- No need for a large DNSSEC dependency surface\r\n- Uses better audited infrastructure\r\n- More secure\r\n- Increases flexibility\r\n\r\n### Signature Validation And Other Crypto Operation Optimizations\r\n\r\nThe underlying crypto code has been reworked to significantly improve its execution speed and reduce the number of memory allocations.  While this has more benefits than enumerated here, probably the most important ones for most stakeholders are:\r\n\r\n- Improved vote times since blocks and transactions propagate more quickly throughout the network\r\n- The initial sync process is around 15% faster\r\n\r\n### Proactive Signature Cache Eviction\r\n\r\nSignature cache entries that are nearly guaranteed to no longer be useful are now immediately and proactively evicted resulting in overall faster validation during steady state operation due to fewer cache misses.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the cache is to avoid double checking signatures that are already known to be valid.\r\n\r\n### Orphan Transaction Relay Policy Refinement\r\n\r\nTransactions that spend outputs which are not known to nodes relaying them, known as orphan transactions, now have the same size restrictions applied to them as standard non-orphan transactions.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that transactions chains are not artificially hindered from relaying regardless of the order they are received.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep memory usage of the now potentially larger orphan transactions under control, more intelligent orphan eviction has been implemented and the maximum number of allowed orphans before random eviction occurs has been lowered.\r\n\r\nThese changes, in conjunction with other related changes, mean that nodes are better about orphan transaction management and thus missing ancestors will typically either be broadcast or mined fairly quickly resulting in fewer overall orphans and smaller actual run-time orphan pools.\r\n\r\n### Ticket Exhaustion Prevention\r\n\r\nMining templates that would lead to the chain becoming unrecoverable due to inevitable ticket exhaustion will no longer be generated.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily aimed at the testing networks, but it could also theoretically affect the main network in some far future if the demand for tickets were to ever dry up for some unforeseen reason.\r\n\r\n### New Initial State Protocol Messages (`getinitstate`/`initstate`)\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a pair of peer-to-peer protocol messages named `getinitstate` and `initstate` which support querying one or more pieces of information that are useful to acquire when a node first connects in a consolidated fashion.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the aforementioned information are the mining state as of the current tip block and, with the introduction of the decentralized treasury, any outstanding treasury spend transactions that are being voted on.\r\n\r\n### Mining State Protocol Messages Deprecated  (`getminings`/`minings`)\r\n\r\nDue to the addition of the previously-described initial state peer-to-peer protocol messages, the `getminings` and `minings` protocol messages are now deprecated.  Use the new `getinitstate` and `initstate` messages with the `headblocks` and `headblockvotes` state types instead.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\nThe RPC server version as of this release is 6.1.2.\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Balance Query RPC (`gettreasurybalance`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettreasurybalance` is now available to query the current balance of the decentralized treasury.  Please note that this requires the decentralized treasury vote to pass and become active, so it will return an appropriate error indicating the decentralized treasury is inactive until that time.\r\n\r\nSee the [gettreasurybalance JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettreasurybalance) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Treasury Spend Vote Query RPC (`gettreasuryspendvotes`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettreasuryspendvotes` is now available to query vote information about one or more treasury spend transactions.  Please note that this requires the decentralized treasury vote to pass and become active to produce a meaningful result since treasury spend transactions are invalid until that time.\r\n\r\nSee the [gettreasuryspendvotes JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettreasuryspendvotes) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Force Mining Template Regeneration RPC (`regentemplate`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `regentemplate` is now available which can be used to force the current background block template to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nSee the [regentemplate JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#regentemplate) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Unspent Transaction Output Set Query RPC (`gettxoutsetinfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `gettxoutsetinfo` is now available which can be used to retrieve statistics about the current global set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\r\n\r\nSee the [gettxoutsetinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#gettxoutsetinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Peer Information Query RPC (`getpeerinfo`)\r\n\r\nThe results of the `getpeerinfo` RPC are now sorted by the `id` field.\r\n\r\nSee the [getpeerinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getpeerinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### Enforced Results Limit on Transaction Search RPC (`searchrawtransactions`)\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of transactions returned by a single request to the `searchrawtransactions` RPC is now limited to 10,000 transactions.  This far exceeds the number of results for all typical cases; however, for the rare cases where it does not, the caller can make use of the `skip` parameter in subsequent requests to access additional data if they require access to more results.\r\n\r\nSee the [searchrawtransactions JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#searchrawtransactions) for API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Index Status Fields on Info Query RPC (`getinfo`)\r\n\r\nThe results of the `getinfo` RPC now include `txindex` and `addrindex` fields that specify whether or not the respective indexes are active.\r\n\r\nSee the [getinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getinfo) for API details.\r\n\r\n### Version 1 Block Filters Deprecated\r\n\r\nSupport for version 1 block filters is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in the next release.   Use [version 2 block filters](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters) with their associated [block header commitment](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-header-commitments) and [inclusion proof](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#verifying-commitment-root-inclusion-proofs) instead.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 605 commits from 17 contributors which total to 525 files changed, 61568 additional lines of code, and 25364 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.5.2...release-v1.6.0-rc1.1).\r\n\r\nSee the [individual dcrd release notes](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.6.0-rc1.1) for a cateogrized breakdown of all commits since the last release.\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- Brian Stafford\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- David Hill\r\n- degeri\r\n- Donald Adu-Poku\r\n- Jamie Holdstock\r\n- Joe Gruffins\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- Julian Yap\r\n- Marco Peereboom\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Matt Hawkins\r\n- Ryan Riley\r\n- Ryan Staudt\r\n- Wisdom Arerosuoghene\r\n- Youssef Boukenken\r\n- zhizhongzhiwai\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrwallet-v160-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.6.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on adding support for the decentralized Decred treasury, improved SPV syncing with version 2 committed filters, and client support for the new privacy-conscious VSP implementation to make mixed VSP ticketbuying viable.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` gRPC method gained a `dont_sign_tx` parameter to support unsigned ticket purchasing and eventual hardware wallet signing.\r\n\r\n* An `AccountMixerService` was added to the gRPC server to perform CoinShuffle++ mixing on all funds received by an account.\r\n\r\n* A `createsignature` JSON-RPC method was introduced, analogous to the gRPC `WalletService.CreateSignature` method.\r\n\r\n* A `discoverusage` JSON-RPC method was introduced, which triggers the same address and account discovery as performed on startup when there are new blocks available.  However, this method is more general purpose and is useful when correcting issues with prior discoveries, at it allows specifying the exact starting blocks and a BIP0044 gap limit to use.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.SignHashes` gRPC method was added to sign an arbitrary number of 32-byte hashes.  This method was used by the now-defunct TumbleBit implementation.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.Spender` gRPC method was added to query the transaction and input index which spends a wallet output.\r\n\r\n* Version 2 committed filters are now used, rather than the previous version 1 filters.  These filters are consensus validated by proof-of-work miners as part of the commitments in the block header.  Version 2 filters are smaller and also do not require knowledge of the exact outputs spent, but rather only the previous output script (or address).\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.TransactionNotifications` gRPC method now provides more details about the block headers which were detached during a reorganize, rather than only their hashes.\r\n\r\n* The `fundrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method is now directly implemented by dcrwallet, rather than delegating this method to dcrd through RPC passthrough.  This allows the method to be usable under SPV mode.\r\n\r\n* An `addtransaction` JSON-RPC method was added, allowing transactions to be manually added to the wallet, mined in a specified block, without discovering the transaction through the network.\r\n\r\n* The `stakepooluserinfo` JSON-RPC method has been reintroduced, after being removed from prior releases.  This is used by the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n* Vote preferences may now be specified on a per-ticket basis with added optional parameters to the `setvotechoice` JSON-RPC method.  This feature is used by the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n* A `WalletService.GetRawCFilters` gRPC method was added to query the wallet-stored version 2 committed filter for specified blocks.\r\n\r\n* A `NetworkService.GetRawBlock` gRPC method was added to fetch raw blocks using the wallet's peer-to-peer implementation.\r\n\r\n* An optional account parameter was added to the `listunspent` and `listlockunspent` JSON-RPC methods to filter results for a particular account.\r\n\r\n* A `ticketinfo` JSON-RPC method was added to provide detailed status information regarding all tickets from the wallet.\r\n\r\n* The `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` method gained support for specifying CoinShuffle++ options for mixed ticket buying.\r\n\r\n* Both a `getpeerinfo` JSON-RPC method and `WalletService.GetPeerInfo` gRPC method were implemented to provide peer info in SPV mode.  The JSON-RPC method continues to return results from a connected dcrd when syncing in RPC mode.\r\n\r\n* A `walletpassphrasechange` JSON-RPC method was added to modify the wallet's public data encryption passphrase.  Changing to the default insecure value \"public\" effectively removes any prompts for the public passphrase at startup.\r\n\r\n* A client for the new vspd server was added, and dcrwallet supports this client functionality from both the ticket autobuyer and through various gRPC methods.\r\n\r\n* The `getcoinjoinsbyacct` JSON-RPC method and `WalletService.GetCoinjoinOutputspByAcct` gRPC methods were added to discover probable CoinJoin transactions and report them by account.\r\n\r\n* Unpublished transactions are now supported.  When an unpublished transaction is saved to the database, the outputs it spends are tallied in balance results and are not spendable by other transactions.  Unpublishd transactions will not be automatically rebroadast to the network when the wallet starts up and begins syncing.  Unpublished transactions are used to record transactions paying vspd fees prior to the vspd instance accepting the client's ticket request.\r\n\r\n* A `--manualtickets` flag was added to the application config.  This setting disables discovering any tickets from the network syncing, instead requiring any tickets to be manually added to the wallet using `addtransaction`.  This feature is used by the new vspd server to avoid voting on unprocessed tickets which used a vspd voting address.  The current state of this setting is reported in the `walletinfo` JSON-RPC result.\r\n\r\n* The LOGFLAGS environment variable may now include a UTC flag to cause the wallet to always log with UTC timestamps, regardless of the current system timezone.\r\n\r\n* The `listunspent` JSON-RPC method now includes the hex encoding of a redeem script when the output is P2SH and the redeem script is known.\r\n\r\n* Support for the decentralized treasury hard fork is added.  Two new JSON-RPC methods `sendtotreasury` and `spendfromtreasury` are added, to send to and spend from value in the treasury, respectively.  The vote version and current agendas have been updated to allow stakeholders to vote on the activation of the decentralized treasury.\r\n\r\n* A `sendrawtransaction` implementation has been added to the JSON-RPC server. This allows arbitrary transactions to be published under SPV mode.\r\n\r\n* Accounts are now able to be encrypted using separate, per-account passphrases. Unlocking an account only provides access to that account's private keys, and no others.  Account passphrases may be set using the `setaccountpassphrase` JSON-RPC method, and locked and unlocked by the `unlockaccount` and `lockaccount` methods.\r\n\r\n* JSON-RPC clients may now be authenticated using TLS client certificates, and this authentication is now required for the gRPC server.  The feature may be enabled for JSON-RPC by using the `--jsonrpcauthtype=clientcert` config flag.  Client certificates read from a `clients.pem` file in the application directory are trusted by default, and this file may be modified by the `--clientcafile` config flag.  Additionally, an `--issueclientcert` flag is provided which causes the wallet to issue and send an ephemeral client certificate and key over the TX pipe to the parent process which forked dcrwallet.  Client certificates may be generated by the `gencerts` tool, which is now part of the Decred CLI distribution.\r\n\r\n* gRPC methods to lock and unlock the wallet's global keys and individually-encrypted accounts are now added, and the passphrase in all requests which required an unlocked wallet are now optional.  As the gRPC server now requires client authentication, there is no a risk of an unauthenticated client from quickly hitting an already-unlocked wallet or account and using private keys it should not otherwise have access to.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Peer-to-peer seeding is now performed over an HTTPS API rather than DNS.  This improves reliability (HTTPS is authenticated), as well as greater control of filtering results by various URL parameters.\r\n\r\n* Many log messages were added, removed, or rewritten to better reflect the operational state of the application.\r\n\r\n* The scrypt KDF used for wallet encryption keys now defaults to weaker parameters on simnet.  This is primarily done for quicker unit tests, but will also affect real dcrwallet simnet instances by requiring less time and memory to derive keys.\r\n\r\n* Imported scripts are now recorded in plain text and the wallet does not need to be unlocked to retrieve the full script for the P2SH address.  This change is made under the assumption that imported redeem scripts should not be secrets themselves, but still require a signature check at the very least.\r\n\r\n* Importing an already-existing redeem script from the `importscript` JSON-RPC method no longer starts a rescan.\r\n\r\n* Outputs which are being mixed are now locked to prevent accidental spending before the mix completes.\r\n\r\n* Mix denominations above the ticket price are now avoided when mixing large value outputs.  This improves pairing with the large volume of mixes occurring from ticket buying, as there are many pairings occurring at the standard denominations below the ticket price to mix CoinJoin change outputs.\r\n\r\n* Mixed ticketbuying using the autobuyer will now default to buy one ticket per client connection if the limit is unset.  Setting a larger limit will continue to buy at most limit number of tickets per client connection.\r\n\r\n* Output locking no longer considers differences between the regular and stake transaction trees.\r\n\r\n* Wallet setup may now be performed by providing answers to the prompts from piped output or a redirected file, as long as the passphrase is provided using the `--pass` flag.\r\n\r\n* Newly created simnet wallets now always use the SLIP0044 coin type.  This ensures that the printed mining address during the creation process will not become invalid after a coin type upgrade from the legacy to the SLIP0044 coin type following address discovery.\r\n\r\n* The latest peer-to-peer protocol version is now supported.  The `miningstate` and `initstate` messages which are expected in this version are replied to with empty responses.\r\n\r\n* Ticket purchasing will now attempt to buy fewer tickets than requested when there is a low balance, either due to a bad estimate of how many tickets could be purchased, or due to outputs being reserved to pay the fees for the new vspd server.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* A memory leak of requests and responses made to a dcrd websocket server was plugged.\r\n\r\n* Imported xpub accounts no longer produce errors while trying to read the account's xpriv.\r\n\r\n* Created transactions are now checked against the current network's maximum transaction size limit, to avoid creating transactions which are too long for consensus-validating nodes to accept.\r\n\r\n* An out-of-bounds panic seen during address discovery of imported xpub accounts was corrected.\r\n\r\n* A data race during the subscribing of transaction notifications involving wallet addresses was fixed.\r\n\r\n* The `getaddressesbyaccount` JSON-RPC method now returns results for the imported account.\r\n\r\n* The database implementation used by dcrwallet (bbolt) was fixed and updated to remove invalid usage of Go's unsafe programming features.\r\n\r\n* The peer-to-peer implementation now allows the same block to be requested concurrently by the same peer.  This fixes some occasional errors which stopped the SPV syncer under normal wallet usage.\r\n\r\n* The autobuyer will no longer mix the change account when the wallet is not up to date with other peers on the network.  This avoids submitting mix requests involving outputs which may have already been spent.\r\n\r\n* A memory leak of wallet address private keys when operating a wallet that remained always unlocked was plugged.\r\n\r\n* The stakebase script found in vote transactions is now included when creating the unsigned vote, rather than during signing.  This fix ensures that the correct stakebase script for the active network is always used, instead of filling in the script for a different network.\r\n\r\n* UTXO selection is now aware of output maturity and will not include immature outputs.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v160-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.6.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release includes some great new features and also includes a large  portion of refactor of the codebase that will, hopefully, lead to more\r\nefficient development in the future.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to include the first iteration of our privacy implementation in  this release.  Users may not set up their wallet to be a \"privacy\" wallet which will allow them to mix funds from a set unmixed account into a clean mixed account.  This new privacy mode also restricts spending to external addresses if turned on to avoid privacy leakage.  Once set up, spending  out of the wallet must only be done from the mixed account. \r\n\r\nWe have also included the new ticket purchasing schema for VSP v3.  No longer do users have to set up VSP accounts.  Tickets are purchased and then the tickets are paid for by paying a small fee upfront.  \r\n\r\nWith the addition of this new ticket purchasing without accounts, we can now mix staking funds with CSPP just like has been available on CLI for some time.  Once privacy is enabled, users may start their autobuyer which will mix funds as new tickets are purchased.\r\n\r\nJoeGruffins went through and updated the whole trezor implementation to work with their new trezor-connect changes upstream.\r\n\r\nI'd like to welcome our new additions to the decrediton team:\r\n\r\n- guilhermemntt\r\n- victorgcramos\r\n- amassarwi\r\n- bgptr\r\n- JoeGruffins\r\n- fguisso\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Individual ticket purchasing and auto buyer for VSP v3 tickets is implemented and will be improved upon in the coming releases.  The Legacy method is still available while people migrate away from those set ups.\r\n\r\n* Peer count is now shown on the side bar.  This should allviate issues where people don't know why their transactions aren't getting mined.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* A full refactor of components into functional components is now mostly complete.  \r\n\r\n* An SPV indicator has been added to the sidebar.  This should help people figure out an issues they may be encountering.\r\n\r\n* Unmined transactions are now able to be abandoned under transaction details.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.5...v1.6.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrlnd-v030\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrlnd v0.3.0\r\n\r\n_Please note that while Bitcoin's Lightning Network has been in production for a few years, Decred's version still hasn't seen extensive use in mainnet. Users should be mindful of the total amount of funds committed to dcrlnd wallets and channels._\r\n\r\nThis is a major dcrlnd release including significant amount of changes.\r\n\r\nThis release brings dcrlnd in line with the upstream lnd [release v0.11.1](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.1-beta) and also includes ports for versions [v0.11.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.0-beta), [v0.10.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta) and [v0.9.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta).\r\n\r\n## Database Migrations\r\n\r\nThis release contains database migrations for the new TLV encoding of invoices,  payment address indexing and close summary information. Old versions of dcrlnd  cannot use the new database version once these migrations are applied.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThe major Decred-specific feature introduced in this release is the ability to  run a dcrlnd instance connected to a dcrwallet running in SPV mode. This is  useful mostly for Decrediton users that will now have the option to run dcrlnd even when their wallet is using the SPV configuration.\r\n\r\n### Node Syncing Config\r\n\r\nCLI users now have two options for the `--node` argument:\r\n\r\n  - `--node=dcrd` instructs dcrlnd to connect to a dcrd instance for on-chain operations.\r\n  - `--node=dcrw` instructs dcrlnd to use the underlying dcrwallet instance for on-chain operations.\r\n\r\nWhen using `--node=dcrd`, the `--dcrd.`-namespaced options should be used to  configure the connection to the underlying dcrd node.\r\n\r\nWhen using `--node=dcrw`, either the `--dcrd.`-namespaced options should be  used, in order to use an _embedded_ dcrwallet instance (that is, dcrwallet  runs automatically inside dcrlnd) **or** the `--dcrw.`-namespaced options  should be used to configure a __remote__ dcrwallet instance.\r\n\r\nNote that SPV mode is only supported on remote dcrwallet instances.\r\n\r\nFor hub nodes (that is, nodes that are online most of the time and offer the ability to receive open channel requests) the recommended config setting  is to use embedded wallets with a dcrd instance.\r\n\r\n### Wumbo Channel Support\r\n\r\nThis release adapts the [Wumbo](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4429) feature for the realities of Decred. Wumbo channel support can be enabled by running dcrlnd with `--protocol.wumbo-channels` and has a global maximum channel size of 500 DCR.\r\n\r\n### Relevant Upstream Changes\r\n\r\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the relevant upstream changes that were ported to dcrlnd. These include changes from the upstream \r\n[v0.9](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/74), [v0.10](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/99) and [v0.11](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/103) lines. Please refer to the respective upstream releases for additional information.\r\n\r\n- Multi Path Payment (MPP) support so that a single payment can be split  among multiple channels.\r\n- Track payments with a new Payment Address field.\r\n- Additional TLV data sent in payments, which allows creating new use cases  to deliver payload data via LN payments.\r\n- Keysend payment experiment which allows spontaneous payments without the  need for a precreated invoice.\r\n- Upfront shutdown script support to enforce channel closure to pay to  pre-configured addresses.\r\n- HTLC Interception API to allow creation of custom payment forwarding engines.\r\n- Additional data in Channel Close Summaries.\r\n- Add ability to limit max remote pending HTLC amount during channel opening.\r\n- Anchor outputs experimental feature.\r\n- External channel funding experimental feature.\r\n- Healthchecks to ensure adequate operating conditions of the node\r\n- Several bug fixes throughout the app.\r\n\r\n## Porting Effort\r\n\r\nA total of 450 upstream PRs were considered for inclusion. The list of of PRs can be found in the acompanying [upstream-prs.csv](/docs/upstream-prs.csv) doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Decred Contributors (Alphabetical Order)\r\n\r\n- Fernando Guisso\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n- Ole Andre Birkedal\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work included in this release is from features and bugfixes performed by the contributors to the upstream [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) project that were ported to  Decred.\r\n\r\nWe wish to sincerely thank them for providing such a high quality project and hope we can continue to contribute in building a large scale and cross-coin LN ecosystem."}

intermittent connections.   It also updates the `dcrctl` utility to include the new `auditreuse` dcrwallet command.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis patch release consists of 4 commits from 3 contributors which total to 4 files changed, 27 additional lines of code, and 6 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.5.0...release-v1.5.1).\r\n\r\n### RPC:\r\n\r\n- rpcwebsocket: Remove client from missed maps ([decred/dcrd#2049](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2049))\r\n- rpcwebsocket: Use nonblocking messages and ntfns ([decred/dcrd#2050](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2050))\r\n\r\n### dcrctl utility changes:\r\n\r\n- dcrctl: Update dcrwallet RPC types package ([decred/dcrd#2051](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2051))\r\n\r\n### Misc:\r\n\r\n- release: Bump for 1.5.1([decred/dcrd#2052](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2052))\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- Dave Collins\r\n- Josh Rickmar\r\n- Matheus Degiovani\r\n\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.5.1\r\n\r\nThis release contains bug fixes and minor feature additions.  A\r\ncomprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* An `auditreuse` JSON-RPC method was added.  This method reports all\r\n  transactions that reuse an output address, excluding votes and\r\n  revocations which must use the committed address from a ticket.  An\r\n  optional block height parameter may be provided to only search for\r\n  reuse following a block.\r\n\r\n* The `createrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method was implemented directly.\r\n  This allows users of the SPV syncing mode to perform the call, rather\r\n  than the call erroring due to no RPC passthrough to a `dcrd` JSON-RPC\r\n  server.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* The `--csppserver.ca` option is now expanded with `~` and environment\r\n  variables.\r\n\r\n* The sample config has been updated with options related to\r\n  CoinShuffle++.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Duplicate logs for insufficient balance errors during automated\r\n  ticketbuying have been silenced.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `TicketBuyerV2Service.RunTicketBuyer` contained a\r\n  regression causing all change to be created for only the default\r\n  (first) account.  A fix was made to restore the previous behavior,\r\n  where change is created for the source account.\r\n\r\n* An address reuse bug caused by resetting child indexes backwards\r\n  after address and account discovery was corrected.  It was possible\r\n  for this bug to be hit any time network synchronization had to be\r\n  restarted (e.g. the `dcrd` JSON-RPC link was lost), because address\r\n  discovery would always occur on resync.\r\n\r\n* A shutdown hang of the `dcrwallet` process following a panic in a\r\n  JSON-RPC handler was fixed with improved synchronization code.\r\n\r\n* A data race in the `signrawtransaction` JSON-RPC method was\r\n  corrected.\r\n\r\n* A memory leak in the JSON-RPC websocket client to `dcrd` was fixed.\r\n  This bug caused excessive memory usage by retaining every unmarshaled\r\n  response in memory for the lifetime of the websocket connection.\r\n\r\n* Extended pubkeys imported via the `importxpub` JSON-RPC method may\r\n  now be used immediately rather than requiring a restart of the process.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1).\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.5.1\r\n\r\nThis patch release for decrediton mainly focuses on patching various issues that\r\nwere found during public usage.  We have also included an update to the QR\r\ncode that shows a basic DCR logo within.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n- The QR Code generated for addresses to receive funds in Decrediton now\r\n  include a blue/green DCR logo in the center.  Functionally, this will be no\r\n  different than before.  ([#2385](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2385)) \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Double notifications were being shown when sending transactions ([#2375](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2375))\r\n\r\n- Allow for the second instance warning to be closed and quit the application.\r\n  ([#2394](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2394))\r\n\r\n- Various typos and spelling fixes. ([#2383](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2383), [#2400](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2400), [#2395](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2395))\r\n\r\n- The number of active tickets on the overview was not showing correctly \r\n  while in SPV wallets.  ([#2389](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2389))\r\n\r\n- Prevent gap exhaustion during change generation. ([#2358](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2358))\r\n\r\n- Disable various elements from being selectable. ([#2388](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2388))\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.5.0...release-v1.5.1)."}

of updates.  Some of the key\r\nhighlights are:\r\n\r\n* A new consensus vote agenda which allows the stakeholders to decide whether or\r\n  not to activate support for block header commitments\r\n* More efficient block filters\r\n* Significant improvements to the mining infrastructure including asynchronous\r\n  work notifications\r\n* Major performance enhancements for transaction script validation\r\n* Automatic external IP address discovery\r\n* Support for IPv6 over Tor\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server such as:\r\n  * A new method to query information about the network\r\n  * A method to retrieve the new version 2 block filters\r\n  * More calls available to limited access users\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the voting process in Decred, all code in order to\r\nsupport block header commitments is already included in this release, however\r\nits enforcement will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, block header commitments were originally proposed and approved\r\nfor initial implementation via the following Politeia proposal:\r\n- [Block Header Commitments Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposal (DCP) describes the proposed changes in\r\ndetail and provides a full technical specification:\r\n- [DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release\r\neven if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.5.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Block Header Commitments Vote\r\n\r\nA new vote with the id `headercommitments` is now available as of this release.\r\nAfter upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet or\r\nVoting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to increase the security and efficiency of\r\nlightweight clients, such as Decrediton in its lightweight mode and the\r\ndcrandroid/dcrios mobile wallets, as well as add infrastructure that paves the\r\nway for several future scalability enhancements.\r\n\r\nA high level overview aimed at a general audience including a cost benefit\r\nanalysis can be found in the\r\n[Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58).\r\n\r\nIn addition, a much more in-depth treatment can be found in the\r\n[motivation section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#motivation).\r\n\r\n### Version 2 Block Filters\r\n\r\nThe block filters used by lightweight clients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment\r\nVerification) wallets, have been updated to improve their efficiency,\r\nergonomics, and include additional information such as the full ticket\r\ncommitment script.  The new block filters are version 2.  The older version 1\r\nfilters are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed in the next release, so\r\nconsumers should update to the new filters as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAn overview of block filters can be found in the\r\n[block filters section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-filters).\r\n\r\nAlso, the specific contents and technical specification of the new version 2\r\nblock filters is available in the\r\n[version 2 block filters section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters).\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a one time database update to build and store the new filters\r\nfor all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete\r\n(typically around 8 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 4 to 5 minutes on SSDs).\r\n\r\n### Mining Infrastructure Overhaul\r\n\r\nThe mining infrastructure for building block templates and delivering the work\r\nto miners has been significantly overhauled to improve several aspects as follows:\r\n\r\n* Support asynchronous background template generation with intelligent vote propagation handling\r\n* Improved handling of chain reorganizations necessary when the current tip is unable to\r\nobtain enough votes\r\n* Current state synchronization\r\n* Near elimination of stale templates when new blocks and votes are received\r\n* Subscriptions for streaming template updates\r\n\r\nThe standard [getwork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getwork)\r\nthat PoW miners currently use to perform the mining process has been updated to\r\nmake use of this new infrastructure, so existing PoW miners will seamlessly get\r\nthe vast majority of benefits without requiring any updates.\r\n\r\nHowever, in addition, a new [notifywork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#notifywork)\r\nis now available that allows miners to register for work to be delivered\r\nasynchronously as it becomes available via a WebSockets\r\n[work notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#work).\r\nThese notifications include the same information that `getwork` provides along\r\nwith an additional `reason` parameter which allows the miners to make better\r\ndecisions about when they should instruct workers to discard the current\r\ntemplate immediately or should be allowed to finish their current round before\r\nbeing provided with the new template.\r\n\r\nMiners are highly encouraged to update their software to make use of the new\r\nasynchronous notification infrastructure since it is more robust, efficient, and\r\nfaster than polling `getwork` to manually determine the aforementioned\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe following is a non-exhaustive overview that highlights the major benefits of\r\nthe changes for both cases:\r\n\r\n- Requests for updated templates during the normal mining process in between tip\r\n  changes will now be nearly instant instead of potentially taking several\r\n  seconds to build the new template on the spot\r\n- When the chain tip changes, requesting a template will now attempt to wait\r\n  until either all votes have been received or a timeout occurs prior to handing\r\n  out a template which is beneficial for PoW miners, PoS miners, and the network\r\n  as a whole\r\n- PoW miners are much less likely to end up with template with less than the max\r\n  number of votes which means they are less likely to receive a reduced subsidy\r\n- PoW miners will be much less likely to receive stale templates during chain\r\n  tip changes due to vote propagation\r\n- PoS voters whose votes end up arriving to the miner slightly slower than the\r\n  minimum number required are much less likely to have their votes excluded\r\n  despite having voted simply due to propagation delay\r\n\r\nPoW miners who choose to update their software, pool or otherwise, to make use\r\nof the asynchronous work notifications will receive additional benefits such as:\r\n\r\n- Ability to start mining a new block sooner due to receiving updated work as\r\n  soon as it becomes available\r\n- Immediate notification with new work that includes any votes that arrive late\r\n- Periodic notifications with new work that include new transactions only when\r\n  there have actually been new transaction\r\n- Simplified interface code due to removal of the need for polling and manually\r\n  checking the work bytes for special cases such as the number of votes\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Miners that are not rolling the timestamp field as they mine should\r\nensure their software is upgraded to roll the timestamp to the latest timestamp\r\neach time they hand work out to a miner.  This helps ensure the block timestamps\r\nare as accurate as possible.**\r\n\r\n### Transaction Script Validation Optimizations\r\n\r\nTransaction script validation has been almost completely rewritten to\r\nsignificantly improve its speed and reduce the number of memory allocations.\r\nWhile this has many more benefits than enumerated here, probably the most\r\nimportant ones for most stakeholders are:\r\n\r\n- Votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce the number of missed votes\r\n- Blocks are able to propagate more quickly throughout the network, which in\r\n  turn further improves votes times\r\n- The initial sync process is around 20-25% faster\r\n\r\n### Automatic External IP Address Discovery\r\n\r\nIn order for nodes to fully participate in the peer-to-peer network, they must\r\nbe publicly accessible and made discoverable by advertising their external IP\r\naddress.  This is typically made slightly more complicated since most users run\r\ntheir nodes on networks behind Network Address Translation (NAT).\r\n\r\nPreviously, in addition to configuring the network firewall and/or router to\r\nallow inbound connections to port 9108 and forwarding the port to the internal\r\nIP address running dcrd, it was also required to manually set the public\r\nexternal IP address via the `--externalip` CLI option.\r\n\r\nThis release will now make use of other nodes on the network in a decentralized\r\nfashion to automatically discover the external IP address, so it is no longer\r\nnecessary to manually set CLI option for the vast majority of users.\r\n\r\n### Tor IPv6 Support\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to resolve and connect to IPv6 peers over Tor in addition to\r\nthe existing IPv4 support.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Version 2 Block Filter Query RPC (`getcfilterv2`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getcfilterv2` is now available which can be used to retrieve\r\nthe version 2 [block filter](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#Block_Filters)\r\nfor a given block along with its associated inclusion proof.  See the\r\n[getcfilterv2 JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getcfilterv2)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Network Information Query RPC (`getnetworkinfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getnetworkinfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\ninformation related to the peer-to-peer network such as the protocol version,\r\nthe local time offset, the number of current connections, the supported network\r\nprotocols, the current transaction relay fee, and the external IP addresses for\r\nthe local interfaces.  See the\r\n[getnetworkinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getnetworkinfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nThe `difficulty` field of the `getblockchaininfo` RPC is now deprecated in favor\r\nof a new field named `difficultyratio` which matches the result returned by the\r\n`getdifficulty` RPC.\r\n\r\nSee the\r\n[getblockchaininfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Optional Version Parameter on Script Decode RPC (`decodescript`)\r\n\r\nThe `decodescript` RPC now accepts an additional optional parameter to specify\r\nthe script version.  The only currently supported script version in Decred is\r\nversion 0 which means decoding scripts with versions other than 0 will be seen\r\nas non standard.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Deprecated Block Template RPC (`getblocktemplate`)\r\n\r\nThe previously deprecated `getblocktemplate` RPC is no longer available.  All\r\nknown miners are already using the preferred `getwork` RPC since Decred's block\r\nheader supports more than enough nonce space to keep mining hardware busy\r\nwithout needing to resort to building custom templates with less efficient extra\r\nnonce coinbase workarounds.\r\n\r\n#### Additional RPCs Available To Limited Access Users\r\n\r\nThe following RPCs that were previously unavailable to the limited access RPC\r\nuser are now available to it:\r\n\r\n- `estimatefee`\r\n- `estimatesmartfee`\r\n- `estimatestakediff`\r\n- `existsaddress`\r\n- `existsaddresses`\r\n- `existsexpiredtickets`\r\n- `existsliveticket`\r\n- `existslivetickets`\r\n- `existsmempoltxs`\r\n- `existsmissedtickets`\r\n- `getblocksubsidy`\r\n- `getcfilter`\r\n- `getcoinsupply`\r\n- `getheaders`\r\n- `getstakedifficulty`\r\n- `getstakeversioninfo`\r\n- `getstakeversions`\r\n- `getvoteinfo`\r\n- `livetickets`\r\n- `missedtickets`\r\n- `rebroadcastmissed`\r\n- `rebroadcastwinners`\r\n- `ticketfeeinfo`\r\n- `ticketsforaddress`\r\n- `ticketvwap`\r\n- `txfeeinfo`\r\n\r\n### Single Mining State Request\r\n\r\nThe peer-to-peer protocol message to request the current mining state\r\n(`getminings`) is used when peers first connect to retrieve all known votes for\r\nthe current tip block.  This is only useful when the peer first connects because\r\nall future votes will be relayed once the connection has been established.\r\nConsequently, nodes will now only respond to a single mining state request.\r\nSubsequent requests are ignored.\r\n\r\n### Developer Go Modules\r\n\r\nA full suite of versioned Go modules (essentially code libraries) are now\r\navailable for use by applications written in Go that wish to create robust\r\nsoftware with reproducible, verifiable, and verified builds.\r\n\r\nThese modules are used to build dcrd itself and are therefore well maintained,\r\ntested, documented, and relatively efficient.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 600 commits from 17 contributors which total to 537\r\nfiles changed, 41494 additional

CoinJoin change\r\n  is not anonymized, and must be isolated to a different account and mixed down\r\n  at standard amount values.\r\n  \r\n  This implementation of CoinShuffle++ currently requires a central server as a\r\n  coordination point between all peers in a mix.  The Decred project operates a\r\n  server at https://cspp.decred.org/, and more details about correct usage can\r\n  be found there.  Anyone is able to host their own server and configure their\r\n  wallets to use it, but for the largest anonymity set it is best that most\r\n  people remain using the same server.\r\n\r\n* Arbitrary extended pubkeys can now be imported as a watching-only account,\r\n  even on wallets which do store private keys for other accounts.  Extended\r\n  pubkeys are imported using the new `importxpub` JSON-RPC method.\r\n\r\n* A --disablecointypeupgrades flag and config setting is added to prevent the\r\n  wallet from ever upgrading the coin type on a seed restored wallet, even when\r\n  there is no observed transactions for the seed.\r\n  \r\n* A `cointype` field has been added to the `walletinfo` JSON-RPC response, and a\r\n  CoinType method has been added to the gRPC WalletService.\r\n\r\n* A `getblockhash` method has been added to the JSON-RPC server.  This allows\r\n  users to query for the best block hash even in SPV mode, where no `dcrd` RPC\r\n  passthrough is available.\r\n\r\n* The `abandontransaction` method has been implemented by the JSON-RPC server.\r\n  This method allows the wallet to forget about any unmined transaction, and\r\n  allows any previous outputs spend by the abandoned transaction to become\r\n  spendable again.\r\n  \r\n* A `GetAccountExtendedPrivKey` method has been added to the gRPC WalletService\r\n  to export the extended private key of an account.\r\n  \r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Double spending vote/revocation transaction errors now include the hashes the\r\n  conflicting transactions.\r\n\r\n* Concurrency was improved throughout with better in-memory data structures and\r\n  reducing how long operations are performed while inside of database views and\r\n  updates.  This should result in overall better performance.\r\n\r\n* Self-signed TLS certificates are now created with ed25519 keys, instead of the\r\n  increasingly unsupported P-521 elliptic curve.\r\n  \r\n* The `--ticketfee` config flag is now deprecated.  Tickets are created with the\r\n  same fee rate as all other transactions.\r\n\r\n* Deprecated config flags from the v1.4.0 release have been removed.\r\n\r\n* Several deprecated methods and fields in the JSON-RPC API have been\r\n  undeprecated.  These were deprecated in upstream code, but are\r\n  still used and necessary for dcrwallet due to differences in account handling.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* A \"missing credit value\" error seen during reorgs of 2+ transaction spend\r\n  chains was corrected.\r\n  \r\n* The Wallet.TransactionSummary method was fixed so that it correctly returns\r\n  the block hash of mined transactions, instead of filling the block hash field\r\n  with the transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* Outbounded SPV peers are removed from an internal \"connecting\" state after any\r\n  error is hit.  This allows the SPV syncer to try other peers instead of losing\r\n  the ability to outbound any new peers.\r\n\r\n* Duplicate ticket hashes are filtered out of the `livetickets` JSON-RPC if they\r\n  are recorded internally in both the transaction and stake stores.\r\n  \r\n* Data races in the wallet's notification emitter were identified and corrected.\r\n\r\n* Duplicate transaction errors when the wallet publishes a transaction to `dcrd`\r\n  with the `sendrawtransaction` JSON-RPC are now handled as successful\r\n  transaction publishes, instead of returning the errors back to the caller.\r\n\r\n* An unlikely bug in Salsa20 (used by the wallet for storing encrypted messages\r\n  in the database), which broke the security guarantees if more than 256GiB of\r\n  the keystream was used, was corrected by upgrading the x/crypto module to a\r\n  newer version with a fix.\r\n\r\n* A data race accessing whether a transaction output is locked or not was fixed.\r\n\r\n* A potential address reuse bug was corrected with improvements to the in-memory\r\n  address index tracking.\r\n  \r\n* The `stakepooluserinfo` JSON-RPC method now correctly sets the status of\r\n  immature tickets to \"immature\" instead of \"live\".\r\n\r\n* Ticket commitments, which do not follow the UTXO model as they can not be\r\n  spent, are now handled specially by the wallet.  This corrects balance\r\n  reporting issues whenever tickets have been bought or observed with relevant\r\n  commitment addresses.\r\n  \r\n* A panic caused by out-of-bounds array access in the SPV syncer was identified\r\n  and corrected.\r\ndfdfdes zero confirmation\r\n  transactions and corrects the `last_block` behavior to match bitcoind.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.4.0...v1.5.0).\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v150\" />\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.5.0\r\n\r\nThis release was primarily focused on overall look and feel refinement and bug\r\nfixes.  It also includes a preliminary Lightning Network implementation by \r\nmatheusd.  Most of the other work was completed by vctt and a new member of the team, bgptr.  Many thanks to them for their hard work on this release.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n- Initial LN Support has been added.  This includes the following functionality:\r\n  dcrlnd startup/teardown, open/close channels, create invoices, send payments,\r\n  enabled autopilot and show dcrlnd logs.  This initial support should give users\r\n  a chance to experience the capabilities of LN while we can also collect user\r\n  feedback about how to best improve their experience with documentation or help.\r\n  To enable LN support, please set the new option \"ln_enabled\" to \"true\" in your\r\n  config.json.\r\n\r\n- Window size responsiveness has been added to most of the pages to allow for\r\n  graceful change from small, medium and large screen sizes.  When in \"small\"\r\n  mode, the sidebar is moved to the bottom of the screen much like a mobile app.\r\n  When in \"medium\" mode, the sidebar is collapsed shows only icons.  When in\r\n  \"large\" mode, the sidebar is fully expanded and all the fields are fully shown.\r\n\r\n## Other updates\r\n\r\n- Dark mode (tonality) has been updated to have a more thoughtfully compiled\r\n  pallette of color combinations.  We can now start to develop other color modes\r\n  if users show an interest in such a feature.\r\n\r\n- The launcher now has a daemon connection timeout detection.  Previously,\r\n  the wallet would endlessly attempt to connect to the daemon, even if the\r\n  daemon had some fatal error that it would never recover from.  This allows \r\n  the user to recover from such a situation more gracefully.\r\n\r\n- Update Politeia proposal fetching to reduce amount of data that is consistantly\r\n  requested.  Previously, every load of decrediton would cause an unnecessary \r\n  amount of data to be requested.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix pasting the hex version of the seed while restoring a wallet.\r\n\r\n- Fix incorrect balance reporting for data exports.\r\n\r\n- Fix advanced mode staring with an empty app data directory.\r\n\r\n- Fix revoked ticket and recent transactions icon.\r\n\r\n- Update lockedByTickets balance to accomodate dcrwallet balance updates staking.\r\n  \r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.4.0...release-v1.5.0).\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrlnd-v020\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrlnd v0.2.0\r\n\r\nThis update has brought dcrlnd synced to the [v0.8.0-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.8.0-beta) of upstream lnd.\r\n\r\nMost upstream work that was done since our original branching point in January 2019 was merged and Decred-specific work has been done to enable more seamless integration of dcrlnd to Decrediton.\r\n\r\nDecred's LN network is still only in its begining stages, therefore please use caution when comitting funds to it.\r\n\r\n## Network Reset & Backwards Incompatible Change\r\n\r\nThose running v0.1.0 or other versions built from code, please note that v0.2.0 has a **network-wide breaking change**. [PR46](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46) changed the algorithm used to encode payment requests from the Decred-default of Blake256 to the Bicoin-compatible SHA-256.\r\n\r\nThis means v0.1.0 nodes cannot use channels with v0.2.0 nodes. and will fail and force-close on the first attempt of payment.\r\n\r\nGiven the v0.1.0 network was still very small we decided to not implement signalling and backwards compatible changes to simplify implementation. Anyone still running the old version **MUST UPGRADE** their node. \r\n\r\n## Notable Changes \r\n\r\n- Support for remote dcrwallets which is used in Decrediton integration [decred/dcrlnd#40](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/40)\r\n\r\n- Switch payment hash algorithm to SHA-256 [decred/dcrlnd#46](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46)\r\n\r\n- Remove the need to connect to a dcrd running with `--txindex` [decred/dcrlnd#41](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/41)\r\n\r\n## Notable Upstream Changes\r\n\r\n[PR36](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36) and [PR42](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/42) are the ones that port the upstream work. Some notable upstream changes brought include the following.\r\n\r\n- Safu Commitments, which was an LN-wide protocol change enabling wallets to retrieve their local channel balance stored in unilaterally-closed channels without requiring coordination with the counterparty.\r\n\r\n- Watchtower support, which allows a wallet to remain closed for a longer period of time by offloading the reposability to watch for channel breaches to a third party called a _watchtower_.\r\n\r\n- Static Channel Backups which are a race-condition-free way of backing up the channel data required to safely execute the Data Loss Protection protocol if the main database of lnd is lost.\r\n\r\n- Hodl invoices which is a way of creating and settling invoices by providing the payment hash/preimage via gRPC and allows bridging the lnd service to more advanced LN-based services such as atomic swaps.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0-rc2).\r\n"}

v1.5.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd introduces a large number of updates.  Some of the key\r\nhighlights are:\r\n\r\n* A new consensus vote agenda which allows the stakeholders to decide whether or\r\n  not to activate support for block header commitments\r\n* More efficient block filters\r\n* Significant improvements to the mining infrastructure including asynchronous\r\n  work notifications\r\n* Major performance enhancements for transaction script validation\r\n* Automatic external IP address discovery\r\n* Support for IPv6 over Tor\r\n* Various updates to the RPC server such as:\r\n  * A new method to query information about the network\r\n  * A method to retrieve the new version 2 block filters\r\n  * More calls available to limited access users\r\n* Infrastructure improvements\r\n* Quality assurance changes\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the voting process in Decred, all code in order to\r\nsupport block header commitments is already included in this release, however\r\nits enforcement will remain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nFor reference, block header commitments were originally proposed and approved\r\nfor initial implementation via the following Politeia proposal:\r\n- [Block Header Commitments Consensus Change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposal (DCP) describes the proposed changes in\r\ndetail and provides a full technical specification:\r\n- [DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release\r\neven if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.5.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Block Header Commitments Vote\r\n\r\nA new vote with the id `headercommitments` is now available as of this release.\r\nAfter upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences through their wallet or\r\nVoting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this change is to increase the security and efficiency of\r\nlightweight clients, such as Decrediton in its lightweight mode and the\r\ndcrandroid/dcrios mobile wallets, as well as add infrastructure that paves the\r\nway for several future scalability enhancements.\r\n\r\nA high level overview aimed at a general audience including a cost benefit\r\nanalysis can be found in the\r\n[Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58).\r\n\r\nIn addition, a much more in-depth treatment can be found in the\r\n[motivation section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#motivation).\r\n\r\n### Version 2 Block Filters\r\n\r\nThe block filters used by lightweight clients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment\r\nVerification) wallets, have been updated to improve their efficiency,\r\nergonomics, and include additional information such as the full ticket\r\ncommitment script.  The new block filters are version 2.  The older version 1\r\nfilters are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed in the next release, so\r\nconsumers should update to the new filters as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAn overview of block filters can be found in the\r\n[block filters section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#block-filters).\r\n\r\nAlso, the specific contents and technical specification of the new version 2\r\nblock filters is available in the\r\n[version 2 block filters section of DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#version-2-block-filters).\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a one time database update to build and store the new filters\r\nfor all existing historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete\r\n(typically around 8 to 10 minutes on HDDs and 4 to 5 minutes on SSDs).\r\n\r\n### Mining Infrastructure Overhaul\r\n\r\nThe mining infrastructure for building block templates and delivering the work\r\nto miners has been significantly overhauled to improve several aspects as follows:\r\n\r\n* Support asynchronous background template generation with intelligent vote propagation handling\r\n* Improved handling of chain reorganizations necessary when the current tip is unable to\r\nobtain enough votes\r\n* Current state synchronization\r\n* Near elimination of stale templates when new blocks and votes are received\r\n* Subscriptions for streaming template updates\r\n\r\nThe standard [getwork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getwork)\r\nthat PoW miners currently use to perform the mining process has been updated to\r\nmake use of this new infrastructure, so existing PoW miners will seamlessly get\r\nthe vast majority of benefits without requiring any updates.\r\n\r\nHowever, in addition, a new [notifywork RPC](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#notifywork)\r\nis now available that allows miners to register for work to be delivered\r\nasynchronously as it becomes available via a WebSockets\r\n[work notification](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#work).\r\nThese notifications include the same information that `getwork` provides along\r\nwith an additional `reason` parameter which allows the miners to make better\r\ndecisions about when they should instruct workers to discard the current\r\ntemplate immediately or should be allowed to finish their current round before\r\nbeing provided with the new template.\r\n\r\nMiners are highly encouraged to update their software to make use of the new\r\nasynchronous notification infrastructure since it is more robust, efficient, and\r\nfaster than polling `getwork` to manually determine the aforementioned\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe following is a non-exhaustive overview that highlights the major benefits of\r\nthe changes for both cases:\r\n\r\n- Requests for updated templates during the normal mining process in between tip\r\n  changes will now be nearly instant instead of potentially taking several\r\n  seconds to build the new template on the spot\r\n- When the chain tip changes, requesting a template will now attempt to wait\r\n  until either all votes have been received or a timeout occurs prior to handing\r\n  out a template which is beneficial for PoW miners, PoS miners, and the network\r\n  as a whole\r\n- PoW miners are much less likely to end up with template with less than the max\r\n  number of votes which means they are less likely to receive a reduced subsidy\r\n- PoW miners will be much less likely to receive stale templates during chain\r\n  tip changes due to vote propagation\r\n- PoS voters whose votes end up arriving to the miner slightly slower than the\r\n  minimum number required are much less likely to have their votes excluded\r\n  despite having voted simply due to propagation delay\r\n\r\nPoW miners who choose to update their software, pool or otherwise, to make use\r\nof the asynchronous work notifications will receive additional benefits such as:\r\n\r\n- Ability to start mining a new block sooner due to receiving updated work as\r\n  soon as it becomes available\r\n- Immediate notification with new work that includes any votes that arrive late\r\n- Periodic notifications with new work that include new transactions only when\r\n  there have actually been new transaction\r\n- Simplified interface code due to removal of the need for polling and manually\r\n  checking the work bytes for special cases such as the number of votes\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Miners that are not rolling the timestamp field as they mine should\r\nensure their software is upgraded to roll the timestamp to the latest timestamp\r\neach time they hand work out to a miner.  This helps ensure the block timestamps\r\nare as accurate as possible.**\r\n\r\n### Transaction Script Validation Optimizations\r\n\r\nTransaction script validation has been almost completely rewritten to\r\nsignificantly improve its speed and reduce the number of memory allocations.\r\nWhile this has many more benefits than enumerated here, probably the most\r\nimportant ones for most stakeholders are:\r\n\r\n- Votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce the number of missed votes\r\n- Blocks are able to propagate more quickly throughout the network, which in\r\n  turn further improves votes times\r\n- The initial sync process is around 20-25% faster\r\n\r\n### Automatic External IP Address Discovery\r\n\r\nIn order for nodes to fully participate in the peer-to-peer network, they must\r\nbe publicly accessible and made discoverable by advertising their external IP\r\naddress.  This is typically made slightly more complicated since most users run\r\ntheir nodes on networks behind Network Address Translation (NAT).\r\n\r\nPreviously, in addition to configuring the network firewall and/or router to\r\nallow inbound connections to port 9108 and forwarding the port to the internal\r\nIP address running dcrd, it was also required to manually set the public\r\nexternal IP address via the `--externalip` CLI option.\r\n\r\nThis release will now make use of other nodes on the network in a decentralized\r\nfashion to automatically discover the external IP address, so it is no longer\r\nnecessary to manually set CLI option for the vast majority of users.\r\n\r\n### Tor IPv6 Support\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to resolve and connect to IPv6 peers over Tor in addition to\r\nthe existing IPv4 support.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Version 2 Block Filter Query RPC (`getcfilterv2`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getcfilterv2` is now available which can be used to retrieve\r\nthe version 2 [block filter](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki#Block_Filters)\r\nfor a given block along with its associated inclusion proof.  See the\r\n[getcfilterv2 JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getcfilterv2)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Network Information Query RPC (`getnetworkinfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getnetworkinfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\ninformation related to the peer-to-peer network such as the protocol version,\r\nthe local time offset, the number of current connections, the supported network\r\nprotocols, the current transaction relay fee, and the external IP addresses for\r\nthe local interfaces.  See the\r\n[getnetworkinfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getnetworkinfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nThe `difficulty` field of the `getblockchaininfo` RPC is now deprecated in favor\r\nof a new field named `difficultyratio` which matches the result returned by the\r\n`getdifficulty` RPC.\r\n\r\nSee the\r\n[getblockchaininfo JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### New Optional Version Parameter on Script Decode RPC (`decodescript`)\r\n\r\nThe `decodescript` RPC now accepts an additional optional parameter to specify\r\nthe script version.  The only currently supported script version in Decred is\r\nversion 0 which means decoding scripts with versions other than 0 will be seen\r\nas non standard.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Deprecated Block Template RPC (`getblocktemplate`)\r\n\r\nThe previously deprecated `getblocktemplate` RPC is no longer available.  All\r\nknown miners are already using the preferred `getwork` RPC since Decred's block\r\nheader supports more than enough nonce space to keep mining hardware busy\r\nwithout needing to resort to building custom templates with less efficient extra\r\nnonce coinbase workarounds.\r\n\r\n#### Additional RPCs Available To Limited Access Users\r\n\r\nThe following RPCs that were previously unavailable to the limited access RPC\r\nuser are now available to it:\r\n\r\n- `estimatefee`\r\n- `estimatesmartfee`\r\n- `estimatestakediff`\r\n- `existsaddress`\r\n- `existsaddresses`\r\n- `existsexpiredtickets`\r\n- `existsliveticket`\r\n- `existslivetickets`\r\n- `existsmempoltxs`\r\n- `existsmissedtickets`\r\n- `getblocksubsidy`\r\n- `getcfilter`\r\n- `getcoinsupply`\r\n- `getheaders`\r\n- `getstakedifficulty`\r\n- `getstakeversioninfo`\r\n- `getstakeversions`\r\n- `getvoteinfo`\r\n- `livetickets`\r\n- `missedtickets`\r\n- `rebroadcastmissed`\r\n- `rebroadcastwinners`\r\n- `ticketfeeinfo`\r\n- `ticketsforaddress`\r\n- `ticketvwap`\r\n- `txfeeinfo`\r\n\r\n### Single Mining State Request\r\n\r\nThe peer-to-peer protocol message to request the current mining state\r\n(`getminings`) is used when peers first connect to retrieve all known votes for\r\nthe current tip block.  This is only useful when the peer first connects because\r\nall future votes will be relayed once the connection has been established.\r\nConsequently, nodes will now only respond to a single mining state request.\r\nSubsequent requests are ignored.\r\n\r\n### Developer Go Modules\r\n\r\nA full suite of versioned Go modules (essentially code libraries) are now\r\navailable for use by applications written in Go that wish to create robust\r\nsoftware with reproducible, verifiable, and verified builds.\r\n\r\nThese modules are used to build dcrd itself and are therefore well maintained,\r\ntested, documented, and relatively efficient.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis release consists of 600 commits from 17 contributors which total to 537\r\nfiles changed, 41494 additional

dcrwallet v1.5.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release introduces the privacy features based on CoinShuffle++.  A new\r\nvoting agenda is also added to vote on the activation of the changes described\r\nin\r\n[DCP0005](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0005/dcp-0005.mediawiki).\r\nA comprehensive list of improvements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* CoinShuffle++ cooperative mixing features are added.  Through this process,\r\n  tickets may be bought from outputs in a CoinJoin transaction.  CoinJoin change\r\n  is not anonymized, and must be isolated to a different account and mixed down\r\n  at standard amount values.\r\n  \r\n  This implementation of CoinShuffle++ currently requires a central server as a\r\n  coordination point between all peers in a mix.  The Decred project operates a\r\n  server at https://cspp.decred.org/, and more details about correct usage can\r\n  be found there.  Anyone is able to host their own server and configure their\r\n  wallets to use it, but for the largest anonymity set it is best that most\r\n  people remain using the same server.\r\n\r\n* Arbitrary extended pubkeys can now be imported as a watching-only account,\r\n  even on wallets which do store private keys for other accounts.  Extended\r\n  pubkeys are imported using the new `importxpub` JSON-RPC method.\r\n\r\n* A --disablecointypeupgrades flag and config setting is added to prevent the\r\n  wallet from ever upgrading the coin type on a seed restored wallet, even when\r\n  there is no observed transactions for the seed.\r\n  \r\n* A `cointype` field has been added to the `walletinfo` JSON-RPC response, and a\r\n  CoinType method has been added to the gRPC WalletService.\r\n\r\n* A `getblockhash` method has been added to the JSON-RPC server.  This allows\r\n  users to query for the best block hash even in SPV mode, where no `dcrd` RPC\r\n  passthrough is available.\r\n\r\n* The `abandontransaction` method has been implemented by the JSON-RPC server.\r\n  This method allows the wallet to forget about any unmined transaction, and\r\n  allows any previous outputs spend by the abandoned transaction to become\r\n  spendable again.\r\n  \r\n* A `GetAccountExtendedPrivKey` method has been added to the gRPC WalletService\r\n  to export the extended private key of an account.\r\n  \r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Double spending vote/revocation transaction errors now include the hashes the\r\n  conflicting transactions.\r\n\r\n* Concurrency was improved throughout with better in-memory data structures and\r\n  reducing how long operations are performed while inside of database views and\r\n  updates.  This should result in overall better performance.\r\n\r\n* Self-signed TLS certificates are now created with ed25519 keys, instead of the\r\n  increasingly unsupported P-521 elliptic curve.\r\n  \r\n* The `--ticketfee` config flag is now deprecated.  Tickets are created with the\r\n  same fee rate as all other transactions.\r\n\r\n* Deprecated config flags from the v1.4.0 release have been removed.\r\n\r\n* Several deprecated methods and fields in the JSON-RPC API have been\r\n  undeprecated.  These were deprecated in upstream code, but are\r\n  still used and necessary for dcrwallet due to differences in account handling.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* A \"missing credit value\" error seen during reorgs of 2+ transaction spend\r\n  chains was corrected.\r\n  \r\n* The Wallet.TransactionSummary method was fixed so that it correctly returns\r\n  the block hash of mined transactions, instead of filling the block hash field\r\n  with the transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* Outbounded SPV peers are removed from an internal \"connecting\" state after any\r\n  error is hit.  This allows the SPV syncer to try other peers instead of losing\r\n  the ability to outbound any new peers.\r\n\r\n* Duplicate ticket hashes are filtered out of the `livetickets` JSON-RPC if they\r\n  are recorded internally in both the transaction and stake stores.\r\n  \r\n* Data races in the wallet's notification emitter were identified and corrected.\r\n\r\n* Duplicate transaction errors when the wallet publishes a transaction to `dcrd`\r\n  with the `sendrawtransaction` JSON-RPC are now handled as successful\r\n  transaction publishes, instead of returning the errors back to the caller.\r\n\r\n* An unlikely bug in Salsa20 (used by the wallet for storing encrypted messages\r\n  in the database), which broke the security guarantees if more than 256GiB of\r\n  the keystream was used, was corrected by upgrading the x/crypto module to a\r\n  newer version with a fix.\r\n\r\n* A data race accessing whether a transaction output is locked or not was fixed.\r\n\r\n* A potential address reuse bug was corrected with improvements to the in-memory\r\n  address index tracking.\r\n  \r\n* The `stakepooluserinfo` JSON-RPC method now correctly sets the status of\r\n  immature tickets to \"immature\" instead of \"live\".\r\n\r\n* Ticket commitments, which do not follow the UTXO model as they can not be\r\n  spent, are now handled specially by the wallet.  This corrects balance\r\n  reporting issues whenever tickets have been bought or observed with relevant\r\n  commitment addresses.\r\n  \r\n* A panic caused by out-of-bounds array access in the SPV syncer was identified\r\n  and corrected.\r\ndfdfdes zero confirmation\r\n  transactions and corrects the `last_block` behavior to match bitcoind.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.4.0...v1.5.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n<a name=\"decrediton-v150-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.5.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release was primarily focused on overall look and feel refinement and bug\r\nfixes.  It also includes a preliminary Lightning Network implementation by \r\nmatheusd.  Most of the other work was completed by vctt and a new member of the team, bgptr.  Many thanks to them for their hard work on this release.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n- Initial LN Support has been added.  This includes the following functionality:\r\n  dcrlnd startup/teardown, open/close channels, create invoices, send payments,\r\n  enabled autopilot and show dcrlnd logs.  This initial support should give users\r\n  a chance to experience the capabilities of LN while we can also collect user\r\n  feedback about how to best improve their experience with documentation or help.\r\n  To enable LN support, please set the new option \"ln_enabled\" to \"true\" in your\r\n  config.json.\r\n\r\n- Window size responsiveness has been added to most of the pages to allow for\r\n  graceful change from small, medium and large screen sizes.  When in \"small\"\r\n  mode, the sidebar is moved to the bottom of the screen much like a mobile app.\r\n  When in \"medium\" mode, the sidebar is collapsed shows only icons.  When in\r\n  \"large\" mode, the sidebar is fully expanded and all the fields are fully shown.\r\n\r\n## Other updates\r\n\r\n- Dark mode (tonality) has been updated to have a more thoughtfully compiled\r\n  pallette of color combinations.  We can now start to develop other color modes\r\n  if users show an interest in such a feature.\r\n\r\n- The launcher now has a daemon connection timeout detection.  Previously,\r\n  the wallet would endlessly attempt to connect to the daemon, even if the\r\n  daemon had some fatal error that it would never recover from.  This allows \r\n  the user to recover from such a situation more gracefully.\r\n\r\n- Update Politeia proposal fetching to reduce amount of data that is consistantly\r\n  requested.  Previously, every load of decrediton would cause an unnecessary \r\n  amount of data to be requested.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix pasting the hex version of the seed while restoring a wallet.\r\n\r\n- Fix incorrect balance reporting for data exports.\r\n\r\n- Fix advanced mode staring with an empty app data directory.\r\n\r\n- Fix revoked ticket and recent transactions icon.\r\n\r\n- Update lockedByTickets balance to accomodate dcrwallet balance updates staking.\r\n  \r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/release-v1.4.0...release-v1.5.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dcrlnd-v020-rc1\" />\r\n\r\n# dcrlnd v0.2.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis update has brought dcrlnd synced to the [v0.8.0-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.8.0-beta) of upstream lnd.\r\n\r\nMost upstream work that was done since our original branching point in January 2019 was merged and Decred-specific work has been done to enable more seamless integration of dcrlnd to Decrediton.\r\n\r\nDecred's LN network is still only in its begining stages, therefore please use caution when comitting funds to it.\r\n\r\n## Network Reset & Backwards Incompatible Change\r\n\r\nThose running v0.1.0 or other versions built from code, please note that v0.2.0 has a **network-wide breaking change**. [PR46](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46) changed the algorithm used to encode payment requests from the Decred-default of Blake256 to the Bicoin-compatible SHA-256.\r\n\r\nThis means v0.1.0 nodes cannot use channels with v0.2.0 nodes. and will fail and force-close on the first attempt of payment.\r\n\r\nGiven the v0.1.0 network was still very small we decided to not implement signalling and backwards compatible changes to simplify implementation. Anyone still running the old version **MUST UPGRADE** their node. \r\n\r\n## Notable Changes \r\n\r\n- Support for remote dcrwallets which is used in Decrediton integration [decred/dcrlnd#40](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/40)\r\n\r\n- Switch payment hash algorithm to SHA-256 [decred/dcrlnd#46](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/46)\r\n\r\n- Remove the need to connect to a dcrd running with `--txindex` [decred/dcrlnd#41](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/41)\r\n\r\n## Notable Upstream Changes\r\n\r\n[PR36](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/36) and [PR42](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/pull/42) are the ones that port the upstream work. Some notable upstream changes brought include the following.\r\n\r\n- Safu Commitments, which was an LN-wide protocol change enabling wallets to retrieve their local channel balance stored in unilaterally-closed channels without requiring coordination with the counterparty.\r\n\r\n- Watchtower support, which allows a wallet to remain closed for a longer period of time by offloading the reposability to watch for channel breaches to a third party called a _watchtower_.\r\n\r\n- Static Channel Backups which are a race-condition-free way of backing up the channel data required to safely execute the Data Loss Protection protocol if the main database of lnd is lost.\r\n\r\n- Hodl invoices which is a way of creating and settling invoices by providing the payment hash/preimage via gRPC and allows bridging the lnd service to more advanced LN-based services such as atomic swaps.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0-rc1).\r\n"}

[dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v140)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v140)\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.4.0\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd introduces a new consensus vote agenda which allows the\r\nstakeholders to decide whether or not to activate changes needed to modify the\r\nsequence lock handling which is required for providing full support for the\r\nLightning Network.  For those unfamiliar with the voting process in Decred, this\r\nmeans that all code in order to make the necessary changes is already included\r\nin this release, however its enforcement will remain dormant until the\r\nstakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nIt also contains smart fee estimation, performance enhancements for block relay\r\nand processing, a major internal restructuring of how unspent transaction\r\noutputs are handled, support for whitelisting inbound peers to ensure service\r\nfor your own SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, various updates to\r\nthe RPC server such as a new method to query the state of the chain and more\r\neasily supporting external RPC connections over TLS, infrastructure\r\nimprovements, and other quality assurance changes.\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposals (DCP) describes the proposed changes in detail:\r\n- [DCP0004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release\r\neven if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.4.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a lengthy one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Fix Lightning Network Sequence Locks Vote\r\n\r\nIn order to fully support the Lightning Network, the current sequence lock\r\nconsensus rules need to be modified.  A new vote with the id `fixlnseqlocks` is\r\nnow available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their\r\npreferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\n### Smart Fee Estimation (`estimatesmartfee`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `estimatesmartfee` is now available which returns a suitable\r\nfee rate for transactions to use in order to have a high probability of them\r\nbeing mined within a specified number of confirmations.  The estimation is based\r\non actual network usage and thus varies according to supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThis is important in the context of the Lightning Network (LN) and, more\r\ngenerally, it provides services and users with a mechanism to choose how to\r\nhandle network congestion.  For example, payments that are high priority might\r\nbe willing to pay a higher fee to help ensure the transaction is mined more\r\nquickly, while lower priority payments might be willing to wait longer in\r\nexchange for paying a lower fee.  This estimation capability provides a way to\r\nobtain a fee that will achieve the desired result with a high probability.\r\n\r\n### Support for Whitelisting Inbound Peers\r\n\r\nWhen peers are whitelisted via the `--whitelist` option, they will now be\r\nallowed to connect even when they would otherwise exceed the maximum number of\r\npeers.  This is highly useful in cases where users have configured their wallet\r\nto use SPV mode and only connect to dcrd instances that they control for\r\nincreased privacy and guaranteed service.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous releases, this release also contains several enhancements to\r\nimprove speed for the initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a lengthy one time database\r\nmigration, as previously mentioned, that typically takes anywhere from 30\r\nminutes to an hour to complete depending on hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Faster Tip Block Relay\r\n\r\nBlocks that extend the current best chain are now relayed to the network\r\nimmediately after they pass the initial sanity and contextual checks, most\r\nnotably valid proof of work.  This allows blocks to propagate more quickly\r\nthroughout the network, which in turn improves vote times.\r\n\r\n#### UTXO Set Restructuring\r\n\r\nThe way the unspent transaction outputs are handled internally has been\r\noverhauled to significantly decrease the time it takes to validate blocks and\r\ntransactions.  While this has many benefits, probably the most important one\r\nfor most stakeholders is that votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce\r\nthe number of missed votes.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getblockchaininfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\nthe state of the chain including details such as its overall verification\r\nprogress during initial sync, the maximum supported block size, and that status\r\nof consensus changes (deployments) which require stakeholder votes.  See the\r\n[JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Vote Creation RPC (`createrawssgen`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `createrawssgen`, which was previously used to allow creating a\r\nvote via RPC is no longer available.  Votes are time sensitive and thus it does\r\nnot make sense to create them offline.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Block and Transaction RPCs\r\n\r\nThe `getblock`, `getblockheader`, `getrawtransaction`, and\r\n`searchrawtransactions` RPCs now contain additional information such as the\r\n`extradata` field in the header, the `expiry` field in transactions, and the\r\n`blockheight` and `blockindex` of  the block that contains a transaction if it\r\nhas been mined.  See the [JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Built-in Support for Enabling External TLS RPC Connections\r\n\r\nA new command line parameter (`--altdnsnames`) and environment variable\r\n(`DCRD_ALT_DNSNAMES`) can now be used before the first launch of drcd to specify\r\nadditional external IP addresses and DNS names to add during the certificate\r\ncreation that are permitted to connect to the RPC server via TLS.  Previously,\r\na separate tool was required to accomplish this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.3.0...release-v1.4.0).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n\r\n- chaincfg: Add checkpoints for 1.4.0 release ([decred/dcrd#1547](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1547))\r\n- chaincfg: Introduce agenda for fixlnseqlocks vote ([decred/dcrd#1578](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1578))\r\n- multi: Enable vote for DCP0004 ([decred/dcrd#1579](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1579))\r\n- peer: Add support for specifying ua comments ([decred/dcrd#1413](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1413))\r\n- blockmanager: Fast relay checked tip blocks ([decred/dcrd#1443](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1443))\r\n- multi: Latest consensus active from simnet genesis ([decred/dcrd#1482](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482))\r\n- server: Always allow whitelisted inbound peers ([decred/dcrd#1516](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516))\r\n\r\n### Transaction relay (memory pool):\r\n\r\n- blockmanager: handle txs in invalid blocks ([decred/dcrd#1430](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1430))\r\n- mempool: Remove potential negative locktime check ([decred/dcrd#1455](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1455))\r\n- mempool: Stake-related readability improvements ([decred/dcrd#1456](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1456))\r\n\r\n### RPC:\r\n\r\n- multi: Include additional fields on RPC tx results ([decred/dcrd#1441](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1441))\r\n- rpcserver: Allow scripthash addrs in createrawsstx ([decred/dcrd#1444](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1444))\r\n- rpcserver: Remove createrawssgen RPC ([decred/dcrd#1448](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1448))\r\n- rpcclient: support getchaintips RPC ([decred/dcrd#1469](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1469))\r\n- multi: Add getblockchaininfo rpc ([decred/dcrd#1479](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479))\r\n- rpcserver: Adds ability to allow alternative dns names for TLS ([decred/dcrd#1476](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476))\r\n- multi: Cleanup recent alt DNS names additions ([decred/dcrd#1493](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1493))\r\n- multi: Cleanup getblock and getblockheader RPCs ([decred/dcrd#1497](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1497))\r\n- multi: Return total chain work in RPC results ([decred/dcrd#1498](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1498))\r\n- rpcserver: Improve GenerateNBlocks error message ([decred/dcrd#1507](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1507))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix verify progress calculation ([decred/dcrd#1508](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1508))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix sendrawtransaction error code ([decred/dcrd#1512](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1512))\r\n- blockchain: Notify stake states after connected block ([decred/dcrd#1515](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1515))\r\n- rpcserver: bump version to 5.0.

focuses on bug fixes and general improvements for both direct\r\ndcrwallet command line users and other projects building on top of dcrwallet\r\n(such as Decrediton and upcoming mobile wallets).  A comprehensive list of\r\nimprovements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes were made to which and how many addresses and wallet UTXOs are watched\r\n  by the SPV and RPC syncers.  This prevents several bugs resulting from missed\r\n  transactions, such as avoiding double spending errors and spends of unknown\r\n  inputs.\r\n\r\n* Committed filter creation and validation is fixed on all ARM processors.\r\n  Previously, an ARM assembly optimization could produce incorrect output for\r\n  the siphash function.\r\n\r\n* During initial wallet creation, the database is now always cleanly closed\r\n  before the process exits.  Previously, this was a race and the new wallet\r\n  database may have been missing writes during the initialization step.\r\n\r\n* RPC connection errors to dcrd are now properly logged\r\n\r\n* A possible deadlock situation was removed by adding a missing mutex unlock to\r\n  the SPV peering implementation.\r\n\r\n* Error handling has been improved when querying unmined and unspent ticket\r\n  transactions.\r\n\r\n* The total number of logged transactions processed by the RPC syncer has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n* The process can be interrupted at startup if while being blocked on acquiring\r\n  the wallet's database lock.  Previously, the process would have needed to be\r\n  killed, or wait for an existing running wallet to shutdown.\r\n  \r\n* Fixed reorganizations failing with \"missing credit value\" errors.  This\r\n  was not a database corruption issue and a wallet restore is not necessary.\r\n\r\n* Fixed the block hash returned by gRPC `WalletService.GetTransaction`\r\n  responses.  This method was prevously using the transaction hash instead\r\n  of the hash of the block the transaction was mined in.\r\n\r\n* Fixed error handling in the RPC sync mode to ensure some synchronization\r\n  errors are not ignored.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` now returns pubkey of P2PKH\r\n  addresses and BIP0044 branch and child index if the address is controlled by\r\n  the wallet.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ImportScript` is now usable by watching-only\r\n  wallets.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.StakeInfo` now includes counts of unspent\r\n  tickets.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `TicketBuyerV2Service.RunTicketBuyer` has been added to run\r\n  the SPV-compatible ticket buyer.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTicket` has been added to query the\r\n  details of an individual ticket by its transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SweepAccount` has been added to sweep all\r\n  UTXOs of an account to a single new output.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.RpcSync` has been added, providing a similar\r\n  as `SpvSync` to perform wallet synchronization with a dcrd RPC connection.\r\n\r\n* The SPV and RPC syncers now support callbacks for syncing notifications.\r\n  These notifications are also availble to gRPC clients who invoke the syncers.\r\n\r\n* Creating a new simnet wallet now shows an address that can be used for mining\r\n  rewards.\r\n\r\n* RPC syncing connections to dcrd can now be proxied using the `--proxy`,\r\n  `--proxyuser`, and `--proxypass` options.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Builds have been converted to use Go Modules.  The repository has been split\r\n  into various submodules, making it far easier to write applications that\r\n  import dcrwallet packages as libraries.\r\n\r\n* Wallet database API is exported for projects that need support for alternative\r\n  database drivers (such as dcrandroid).\r\n\r\n* Default transaction relay fee has been dropped to 0.0001 DCR/kB.\r\n\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation is improved for ticket purchases and any\r\n  transaction that redeems a P2SH output.\r\n\r\n* DCP0001-0003 now apply to simnet from the start of the chain (note that this\r\n  is a hard fork for existing simnets).\r\n\r\n* Log files are never automatically deleted.  Previously, log files would be\r\n  rotated and old log files would be automatically removed.  This has been\r\n  changed to avoid the loss of potentially important logs.\r\n\r\n* Logs for unexpected database consistency issues have been improved by logging\r\n  the keys and values\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.4.0\r\n\r\nThis decrediton release has been mostly dedicated to fixing nagging issues\r\nwith users and cleaning up styling and design overall.  We are also happy to\r\ninclude new features such as: alpha Trezor support, initial alternative color themes,\r\nenhanced Governance/Politeia integration and a prominent page to choose SPV or normal mode.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to introduce initial Trezor hardware wallet support.  This includes\r\nthe ability to create transactions in decrediton and then sign them with the\r\nconnected device.  We will be working hard to add staking on Trezor in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAlternative color themes have been a constantly suggested feature since the\r\nlaunch of decrediton. We have added an initial proof of concept for a dark theme\r\ntoggle.  The colors are not yet final and design will hopefully provide a series\r\nof possible themes instead of simply light and dark.  \r\n\r\nThis release is the first to directly ask users on startup whether or not they \r\nwould like to use SPV mode or not.  This will hopefully increase SPV usage and \r\nprovide better/faster wallet support for most users.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Trezor integration has been added.  This allows users to essentially use \r\n  decrediton as watch-only wallet that is able to have its transactions signed\r\n  directly by their Trezor device.  Staking isn't yet currently available, but\r\n  we'll be looking in to adding that soon.  While we have tested and verified\r\n  this initial Trezor integration, we will hold off on prominently advertising \r\n  this until we can fully confirm it is bug free and secure.  \r\n\r\n* Decrediton has switched to using the ticketbuyer v2 service from the wallet \r\n  (instead of the old v1). Given that after [DCP-0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) the \r\n  ticket price has been stable, there's no need for that many configuration \r\n  parameters anymore. Version 2 of the ticket buyer needs to be configured only \r\n  with the source account, target stakepool and how much balance should be left \r\n  spendable. The buyer will then purchase as many tickets as possible, while \r\n  maintaining that balance.\r\n\r\n* Launcher Sync Stream.  Now both modes (SPV/RPC) both use the same notification\r\n  types to update during launching.  This helps with being able to allow dcrwallet\r\n  to handle all of the syncing and simply just update on similiar notifications.\r\n  Previously, there were situations that were causing issues since syncing steps\r\n  would be done out of order.\r\n\r\n* All users will see a new page on first load that lets them select whether or\r\n  not they would like to enable SPV mode.  We have also added a link to a newly\r\n  created document explaining everything about [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv).\r\n\r\n* We have added an early proof of concept for color theme toggling.  The colors\r\n  for the added dark theme are still being finalized by design, but the button\r\n  can be found on the Settings page.\r\n\r\n* Whenever a panic is detected by decrediton in dcrd or dcrwallet, users are now\r\n  sent to a seperate fatal error screen where they will be able to copy the logs\r\n  to be able to provide them to the developers and support.  This will hopefully\r\n  help users receive better direction to alleviate issues that are hitting.\r\n\r\n* Notifications have been completed restyled and fixed to allow for multiple\r\n  simultaneous notifications.  There is now a prominent closer button and timer\r\n  for automatic notification closing. \r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Eeter and kylefirethought have delivered a whole new set of animated menu icons.\r\n  These can be seen when hovering over a given menu page tab.  \r\n\r\n* The Governance Page has received a large styling overhaul as provided by Eeter\r\n  LLC.  Most importantly, notification bubbles have been added to let users\r\n  know when there are new proposals and votes to see.\r\n\r\n* Various clean up and refinement to the launcher.  There were issues in SPV mode\r\n  that were causing confusion about whether it was waiting to connect to a\r\n  daemon to proceed or not.  Now it should always be clear to the user when they\r\n  need to resolve something to proceed or if they should expect to wait for\r\n  something to happen.\r\n\r\n* We have updated some error messages to better explain to users what the\r\n  problem is and how it can be resolved.\r\n\r\n* Watch-only wallets are now able to create unsigned transactions that can be\r\n  transferred to an unlocked wallet for signing and subsequent broadcasting.\r\n\r\n* Add an import script button to the Add Stakepool form.  There are some users\r\n  that wish to simply import their script without having to communicate with any\r\n  outside sources.\r\n\r\n* The min default relay fee was updated in dcrd a few releases ago and now the\r\n  network has sufficiently upgraded to allow for wallet software to use 0.0001\r\n  DCR/kB as the default.  Any transaction or ticket created in decrediton or \r\n  dcrwallet should now use that minimum fee from now on.\r\n\r\n* Change to use the documentation subsystem to add the release notes.  This will\r\n  allow us to be more flexible when adding new release notes and letting users\r\n  review older ones.\r\n\r\n* Add decrediton logs to the Logs tab underneath the Help page.\r\n\r\n* With the addition of `getblockchaininfo` json-rpc command in dcrd, we are\r\n  now able to properly determine the progress of dcrd syncing.  This removes the\r\n  need to use outside sources to figure out know the syncing progress.\r\n\r\n* Transactions are now decoded within decrediton instead of being sent back to \r\n  dcrwallet for decoding.  This should help with performance to avoid an\r\n  unnecessary request.\r\n\r\n* Chinese language has been extensively reviewed by long time Asian community \r\n  contributor @Guang168\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* There were various issues with the display of recent staking transactions on\r\n  the Overview and the My Tickets pages. \r\n\r\n* Startup stats have been fixed to properly update and work better for large wallets \r\n\r\n* The application About button in macOS now also opens the About modal.\r\n\r\n* CSV exporting now correctly generates timestamps in UTC or local time based \r\n  on app config (thanks to @rocknet for the first contribution).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.3.0...release-v1.4)."}

For those unfamiliar with the voting process in Decred, this\r\nmeans that all code in order to make the necessary changes is already included\r\nin this release, however its enforcement will remain dormant until the\r\nstakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nIt also contains smart fee estimation, performance enhancements for block relay\r\nand processing, a major internal restructuring of how unspent transaction\r\noutputs are handled, support for whitelisting inbound peers to ensure service\r\nfor your own SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, various updates to\r\nthe RPC server such as a new method to query the state of the chain and more\r\neasily supporting external RPC connections over TLS, infrastructure\r\nimprovements, and other quality assurance changes.\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposals (DCP) describes the proposed changes in detail:\r\n- [DCP0004](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0004/dcp-0004.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n**It is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release\r\neven if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.4.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a lengthy one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Fix Lightning Network Sequence Locks Vote\r\n\r\nIn order to fully support the Lightning Network, the current sequence lock\r\nconsensus rules need to be modified.  A new vote with the id `fixlnseqlocks` is\r\nnow available as of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their\r\npreferences through their wallet or Voting Service Provider's (VSP) website.\r\n\r\n### Smart Fee Estimation (`estimatesmartfee`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `estimatesmartfee` is now available which returns a suitable\r\nfee rate for transactions to use in order to have a high probability of them\r\nbeing mined within a specified number of confirmations.  The estimation is based\r\non actual network usage and thus varies according to supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThis is important in the context of the Lightning Network (LN) and, more\r\ngenerally, it provides services and users with a mechanism to choose how to\r\nhandle network congestion.  For example, payments that are high priority might\r\nbe willing to pay a higher fee to help ensure the transaction is mined more\r\nquickly, while lower priority payments might be willing to wait longer in\r\nexchange for paying a lower fee.  This estimation capability provides a way to\r\nobtain a fee that will achieve the desired result with a high probability.\r\n\r\n### Support for Whitelisting Inbound Peers\r\n\r\nWhen peers are whitelisted via the `--whitelist` option, they will now be\r\nallowed to connect even when they would otherwise exceed the maximum number of\r\npeers.  This is highly useful in cases where users have configured their wallet\r\nto use SPV mode and only connect to dcrd instances that they control for\r\nincreased privacy and guaranteed service.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous releases, this release also contains several enhancements to\r\nimprove speed for the initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a lengthy one time database\r\nmigration, as previously mentioned, that typically takes anywhere from 30\r\nminutes to an hour to complete depending on hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Faster Tip Block Relay\r\n\r\nBlocks that extend the current best chain are now relayed to the network\r\nimmediately after they pass the initial sanity and contextual checks, most\r\nnotably valid proof of work.  This allows blocks to propagate more quickly\r\nthroughout the network, which in turn improves vote times.\r\n\r\n#### UTXO Set Restructuring\r\n\r\nThe way the unspent transaction outputs are handled internally has been\r\noverhauled to significantly decrease the time it takes to validate blocks and\r\ntransactions.  While this has many benefits, probably the most important one\r\nfor most stakeholders is that votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce\r\nthe number of missed votes.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getblockchaininfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\nthe state of the chain including details such as its overall verification\r\nprogress during initial sync, the maximum supported block size, and that status\r\nof consensus changes (deployments) which require stakeholder votes.  See the\r\n[JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Vote Creation RPC (`createrawssgen`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `createrawssgen`, which was previously used to allow creating a\r\nvote via RPC is no longer available.  Votes are time sensitive and thus it does\r\nnot make sense to create them offline.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Block and Transaction RPCs\r\n\r\nThe `getblock`, `getblockheader`, `getrawtransaction`, and\r\n`searchrawtransactions` RPCs now contain additional information such as the\r\n`extradata` field in the header, the `expiry` field in transactions, and the\r\n`blockheight` and `blockindex` of  the block that contains a transaction if it\r\nhas been mined.  See the [JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Built-in Support for Enabling External TLS RPC Connections\r\n\r\nA new command line parameter (`--altdnsnames`) and environment variable\r\n(`DCRD_ALT_DNSNAMES`) can now be used before the first launch of drcd to specify\r\nadditional external IP addresses and DNS names to add during the certificate\r\ncreation that are permitted to connect to the RPC server via TLS.  Previously,\r\na separate tool was required to accomplish this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.3.0...release-v1.4.0-rc3).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n\r\n- chaincfg: Add checkpoints for 1.4.0 release ([decred/dcrd#1547](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1547))\r\n- chaincfg: Introduce agenda for fixlnseqlocks vote ([decred/dcrd#1578](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1578))\r\n- multi: Enable vote for DCP0004 ([decred/dcrd#1579](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1579))\r\n- peer: Add support for specifying ua comments ([decred/dcrd#1413](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1413))\r\n- blockmanager: Fast relay checked tip blocks ([decred/dcrd#1443](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1443))\r\n- multi: Latest consensus active from simnet genesis ([decred/dcrd#1482](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482))\r\n- server: Always allow whitelisted inbound peers ([decred/dcrd#1516](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516))\r\n\r\n### Transaction relay (memory pool):\r\n\r\n- blockmanager: handle txs in invalid blocks ([decred/dcrd#1430](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1430))\r\n- mempool: Remove potential negative locktime check ([decred/dcrd#1455](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1455))\r\n- mempool: Stake-related readability improvements ([decred/dcrd#1456](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1456))\r\n\r\n### RPC:\r\n\r\n- multi: Include additional fields on RPC tx results ([decred/dcrd#1441](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1441))\r\n- rpcserver: Allow scripthash addrs in createrawsstx ([decred/dcrd#1444](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1444))\r\n- rpcserver: Remove createrawssgen RPC ([decred/dcrd#1448](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1448))\r\n- rpcclient: support getchaintips RPC ([decred/dcrd#1469](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1469))\r\n- multi: Add getblockchaininfo rpc ([decred/dcrd#1479](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479))\r\n- rpcserver: Adds ability to allow alternative dns names for TLS ([decred/dcrd#1476](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476))\r\n- multi: Cleanup recent alt DNS names additions ([decred/dcrd#1493](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1493))\r\n- multi: Cleanup getblock and getblockheader RPCs ([decred/dcrd#1497](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1497))\r\n- multi: Return total chain work in RPC results ([decred/dcrd#1498](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1498))\r\n- rpcserver: Improve GenerateNBlocks error message ([decred/dcrd#1507](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1507))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix verify progress calculation ([decred/dcrd#1508](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1508))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix sendrawtransaction error code ([decred/dcrd#1512](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1512))\r\n- blockchain: Notify stake states after connected block ([decred/dcrd#1515](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1515))\r\n- rpcserver: bump version to 5.0.

focuses on bug fixes and general improvements for both direct\r\ndcrwallet command line users and other projects building on top of dcrwallet\r\n(such as Decrediton and upcoming mobile wallets).  A comprehensive list of\r\nimprovements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes were made to which and how many addresses and wallet UTXOs are watched\r\n  by the SPV and RPC syncers.  This prevents several bugs resulting from missed\r\n  transactions, such as avoiding double spending errors and spends of unknown\r\n  inputs.\r\n\r\n* Committed filter creation and validation is fixed on all ARM processors.\r\n  Previously, an ARM assembly optimization could produce incorrect output for\r\n  the siphash function.\r\n\r\n* During initial wallet creation, the database is now always cleanly closed\r\n  before the process exits.  Previously, this was a race and the new wallet\r\n  database may have been missing writes during the initialization step.\r\n\r\n* RPC connection errors to dcrd are now properly logged\r\n\r\n* A possible deadlock situation was removed by adding a missing mutex unlock to\r\n  the SPV peering implementation.\r\n\r\n* Error handling has been improved when querying unmined and unspent ticket\r\n  transactions.\r\n\r\n* The total number of logged transactions processed by the RPC syncer has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n* The process can be interrupted at startup if while being blocked on acquiring\r\n  the wallet's database lock.  Previously, the process would have needed to be\r\n  killed, or wait for an existing running wallet to shutdown.\r\n  \r\n* Fixed reorganizations failing with \"missing credit value\" errors.  This\r\n  was not a database corruption issue and a wallet restore is not necessary.\r\n\r\n* Fixed the block hash returned by gRPC `WalletService.GetTransaction`\r\n  responses.  This method was prevously using the transaction hash instead\r\n  of the hash of the block the transaction was mined in.\r\n\r\n* Fixed error handling in the RPC sync mode to ensure some synchronization\r\n  errors are not ignored.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` now returns pubkey of P2PKH\r\n  addresses and BIP0044 branch and child index if the address is controlled by\r\n  the wallet.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ImportScript` is now usable by watching-only\r\n  wallets.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.StakeInfo` now includes counts of unspent\r\n  tickets.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `TicketBuyerV2Service.RunTicketBuyer` has been added to run\r\n  the SPV-compatible ticket buyer.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTicket` has been added to query the\r\n  details of an individual ticket by its transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SweepAccount` has been added to sweep all\r\n  UTXOs of an account to a single new output.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.RpcSync` has been added, providing a similar\r\n  as `SpvSync` to perform wallet synchronization with a dcrd RPC connection.\r\n\r\n* The SPV and RPC syncers now support callbacks for syncing notifications.\r\n  These notifications are also availble to gRPC clients who invoke the syncers.\r\n\r\n* Creating a new simnet wallet now shows an address that can be used for mining\r\n  rewards.\r\n\r\n* RPC syncing connections to dcrd can now be proxied using the `--proxy`,\r\n  `--proxyuser`, and `--proxypass` options.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Builds have been converted to use Go Modules.  The repository has been split\r\n  into various submodules, making it far easier to write applications that\r\n  import dcrwallet packages as libraries.\r\n\r\n* Wallet database API is exported for projects that need support for alternative\r\n  database drivers (such as dcrandroid).\r\n\r\n* Default transaction relay fee has been dropped to 0.0001 DCR/kB.\r\n\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation is improved for ticket purchases and any\r\n  transaction that redeems a P2SH output.\r\n\r\n* DCP0001-0003 now apply to simnet from the start of the chain (note that this\r\n  is a hard fork for existing simnets).\r\n\r\n* Log files are never automatically deleted.  Previously, log files would be\r\n  rotated and old log files would be automatically removed.  This has been\r\n  changed to avoid the loss of potentially important logs.\r\n\r\n* Logs for unexpected database consistency issues have been improved by logging\r\n  the keys and values\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.4.0-rc3\r\n\r\nThis decrediton release has been mostly dedicated to fixing nagging issues\r\nwith users and cleaning up styling and design overall.  We are also happy to\r\ninclude new features such as: alpha Trezor support, initial alternative color themes,\r\nenhanced Governance/Politeia integration and a prominent page to choose SPV or normal mode.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to introduce initial Trezor hardware wallet support.  This includes\r\nthe ability to create transactions in decrediton and then sign them with the\r\nconnected device.  We will be working hard to add staking on Trezor in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAlternative color themes have been a constantly suggested feature since the\r\nlaunch of decrediton. We have added an initial proof of concept for a dark theme\r\ntoggle.  The colors are not yet final and design will hopefully provide a series\r\nof possible themes instead of simply light and dark.  \r\n\r\nThis release is the first to directly ask users on startup whether or not they \r\nwould like to use SPV mode or not.  This will hopefully increase SPV usage and \r\nprovide better/faster wallet support for most users.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Trezor integration has been added.  This allows users to essentially use \r\n  decrediton as watch-only wallet that is able to have its transactions signed\r\n  directly by their Trezor device.  Staking isn't yet currently available, but\r\n  we'll be looking in to adding that soon.  While we have tested and verified\r\n  this initial Trezor integration, we will hold off on prominently advertising \r\n  this until we can fully confirm it is bug free and secure.  \r\n\r\n* Decrediton has switched to using the ticketbuyer v2 service from the wallet \r\n  (instead of the old v1). Given that after [DCP-0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) the \r\n  ticket price has been stable, there's no need for that many configuration \r\n  parameters anymore. Version 2 of the ticket buyer needs to be configured only \r\n  with the source account, target stakepool and how much balance should be left \r\n  spendable. The buyer will then purchase as many tickets as possible, while \r\n  maintaining that balance.\r\n\r\n* Launcher Sync Stream.  Now both modes (SPV/RPC) both use the same notification\r\n  types to update during launching.  This helps with being able to allow dcrwallet\r\n  to handle all of the syncing and simply just update on similiar notifications.\r\n  Previously, there were situations that were causing issues since syncing steps\r\n  would be done out of order.\r\n\r\n* All users will see a new page on first load that lets them select whether or\r\n  not they would like to enable SPV mode.  We have also added a link to a newly\r\n  created document explaining everything about [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv).\r\n\r\n* We have added an early proof of concept for color theme toggling.  The colors\r\n  for the added dark theme are still being finalized by design, but the button\r\n  can be found on the Settings page.\r\n\r\n* Whenever a panic is detected by decrediton in dcrd or dcrwallet, users are now\r\n  sent to a seperate fatal error screen where they will be able to copy the logs\r\n  to be able to provide them to the developers and support.  This will hopefully\r\n  help users receive better direction to alleviate issues that are hitting.\r\n\r\n* Notifications have been completed restyled and fixed to allow for multiple\r\n  simultaneous notifications.  There is now a prominent closer button and timer\r\n  for automatic notification closing. \r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Eeter and kylefirethought have delivered a whole new set of animated menu icons.\r\n  These can be seen when hovering over a given menu page tab.  \r\n\r\n* The Governance Page has received a large styling overhaul as provided by Eeter\r\n  LLC.  Most importantly, notification bubbles have been added to let users\r\n  know when there are new proposals and votes to see.\r\n\r\n* Various clean up and refinement to the launcher.  There were issues in SPV mode\r\n  that were causing confusion about whether it was waiting to connect to a\r\n  daemon to proceed or not.  Now it should always be clear to the user when they\r\n  need to resolve something to proceed or if they should expect to wait for\r\n  something to happen.\r\n\r\n* We have updated some error messages to better explain to users what the\r\n  problem is and how it can be resolved.\r\n\r\n* Watch-only wallets are now able to create unsigned transactions that can be\r\n  transferred to an unlocked wallet for signing and subsequent broadcasting.\r\n\r\n* Add an import script button to the Add Stakepool form.  There are some users\r\n  that wish to simply import their script without having to communicate with any\r\n  outside sources.\r\n\r\n* The min default relay fee was updated in dcrd a few releases ago and now the\r\n  network has sufficiently upgraded to allow for wallet software to use 0.0001\r\n  DCR/kB as the default.  Any transaction or ticket created in decrediton or \r\n  dcrwallet should now use that minimum fee from now on.\r\n\r\n* Change to use the documentation subsystem to add the release notes.  This will\r\n  allow us to be more flexible when adding new release notes and letting users\r\n  review older ones.\r\n\r\n* Add decrediton logs to the Logs tab underneath the Help page.\r\n\r\n* With the addition of `getblockchaininfo` json-rpc command in dcrd, we are\r\n  now able to properly determine the progress of dcrd syncing.  This removes the\r\n  need to use outside sources to figure out know the syncing progress.\r\n\r\n* Transactions are now decoded within decrediton instead of being sent back to \r\n  dcrwallet for decoding.  This should help with performance to avoid an\r\n  unnecessary request.\r\n\r\n* Chinese language has been extensively reviewed by long time Asian community \r\n  contributor @Guang168\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* There were various issues with the display of recent staking transactions on\r\n  the Overview and the My Tickets pages. \r\n\r\n* Startup stats have been fixed to properly update and work better for large wallets \r\n\r\n* The application About button in macOS now also opens the About modal.\r\n\r\n* CSV exporting now correctly generates timestamps in UTC or local time based \r\n  on app config (thanks to @rocknet for the first contribution).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.3.0...release-v1.4).\r\n"}

[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\r\n\r\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run [decrediton

Windows](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.4.0-rc2/decrediton-v1.4.0-rc2.exe).\r\n\r\nSee manifest-v1.4.0-rc2.txt, and the package specific manifest files for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [dcrd](#dcrd-v140rc2)\r\n* [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v140rc2)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v140rc2)\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.4.0-rc2\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd contains smart fee estimation, performance enhancements for\r\nblock relay and processing, a major internal restructuring of how unspent\r\ntransaction outputs are handled, support for whitelisting inbound peers to\r\nensure service for your own SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets,\r\nvarious updates to the RPC server such as a new method to query the state of the\r\nchain and more easily supporting external RPC connections over TLS,\r\ninfrastructure improvements, and other quality assurance changes.\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to this latest release as it\r\ncontains many important scalability improvements and smart fee estimation.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.4.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a lengthy one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Smart Fee Estimation (`estimatesmartfee`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `estimatesmartfee` is now available which returns a suitable\r\nfee rate for transactions to use in order to have a high probability of them\r\nbeing mined within a specified number of confirmations.  The estimation is based\r\non actual network usage and thus varies according to supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThis is important in the context of the Lightning Network (LN) and, more\r\ngenerally, it provides services and users with a mechanism to choose how to\r\nhandle network congestion.  For example, payments that are high priority might\r\nbe willing to pay a higher fee to help ensure the transaction is mined more\r\nquickly, while lower priority payments might be willing to wait longer in\r\nexchange for paying a lower fee.  This estimation capability provides a way to\r\nobtain a fee that will achieve the desired result with a high probability.\r\n\r\n### Support for Whitelisting Inbound Peers\r\n\r\nWhen peers are whitelisted via the `--whitelist` option, they will now be\r\nallowed to connect even when they would otherwise exceed the maximum number of\r\npeers.  This is highly useful in cases where users have configured their wallet\r\nto use SPV mode and only connect to dcrd instances that they control for\r\nincreased privacy and guaranteed service.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous releases, this release also contains several enhancements to\r\nimprove speed for the initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a lengthy one time database\r\nmigration, as previously mentioned, that typically takes anywhere from 30\r\nminutes to an hour to complete depending on hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Faster Tip Block Relay\r\n\r\nBlocks that extend the current best chain are now relayed to the network\r\nimmediately after they pass the initial sanity and contextual checks, most\r\nnotably valid proof of work.  This allows blocks to propagate more quickly\r\nthroughout the network, which in turn improves vote times.\r\n\r\n#### UTXO Set Restructuring\r\n\r\nThe way the unspent transaction outputs are handled internally has been\r\noverhauled to significantly decrease the time it takes to validate block and\r\ntransactions.  While this has many benefits, probably the most important one\r\nfor most stakeholders is that votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce\r\nthe number of missed votes.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getblockchaininfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\nthe state of the chain including details such as its overall verification\r\nprogress during initial sync, the maximum supported block size, and that status\r\nof consensus changes (deployments) which require stakeholder votes.  See the\r\n[JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Vote Creation RPC (`createrawssgen`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `createrawssgen`, which was previously used to allow creating a\r\nvote via RPC is no longer available.  Votes are time sensitive and thus it does\r\nnot make sense to create them offline.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Block and Transaction RPCs\r\n\r\nThe `getblock`, `getblockheader`, and `getrawtransaction`, and\r\n`searchrawtransactions` RPCs now contain additional information such as the\r\n`extradata` field in the header, the `expiry` field in transactions, and the\r\n`blockheight` and `blockindex` of  the block that contains a transaction if it\r\nhas been mined.  See the [JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Built-in Support for Enabling External TLS RPC Connections\r\n\r\nA new command line parameter (`--altdnsnames`) and environment variable\r\n(`DCRD_ALT_DNSNAMES`) can now be used before the first launch of drcd to specify\r\nadditional external IP addresses and DNS names to add during the certificate\r\ncreation that are permitted to connect to the RPC server via TLS.  Previously,\r\na separate tool was required to accomplish this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.3.0...release-v1.4.0-rc2).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n\r\n- chaincfg: Add checkpoints for 1.4.0 release ([decred/dcrd#1547](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1547))\r\n- peer: Add support for specifying ua comments ([decred/dcrd#1413](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1413))\r\n- blockmanager: Fast relay checked tip blocks ([decred/dcrd#1443](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1443))\r\n- multi: Latest consensus active from simnet genesis ([decred/dcrd#1482](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482))\r\n- server: Always allow whitelisted inbound peers ([decred/dcrd#1516](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516))\r\n\r\n### Transaction relay (memory pool):\r\n\r\n- blockmanager: handle txs in invalid blocks ([decred/dcrd#1430](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1430))\r\n- mempool: Remove potential negative locktime check ([decred/dcrd#1455](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1455))\r\n- mempool: Stake-related readability improvements ([decred/dcrd#1456](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1456))\r\n\r\n### RPC:\r\n\r\n- multi: Include additional fields on RPC tx results ([decred/dcrd#1441](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1441))\r\n- rpcserver: Allow scripthash addrs in createrawsstx ([decred/dcrd#1444](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1444))\r\n- rpcserver: Remove createrawssgen RPC ([decred/dcrd#1448](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1448))\r\n- rpcclient: support getchaintips RPC ([decred/dcrd#1469](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1469))\r\n- multi: Add getblockchaininfo rpc ([decred/dcrd#1479](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479))\r\n- rpcserver: Adds ability to allow alternative dns names for TLS ([decred/dcrd#1476](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476))\r\n- multi: Cleanup recent alt DNS names additions ([decred/dcrd#1493](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1493))\r\n- multi: Cleanup getblock and getblockheader RPCs ([decred/dcrd#1497](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1497))\r\n- multi: Return total chain work in RPC results ([decred/dcrd#1498](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1498))\r\n- rpcserver: Improve GenerateNBlocks error message ([decred/dcrd#1507](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1507))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix verify progress calculation ([decred/dcrd#1508](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1508))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix sendrawtransaction error code ([decred/dcrd#1512](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1512))\r\n- blockchain: Notify stake states after connected block ([decred/dcrd#1515](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1515))\r\n- rpcserver: bump version to 5.0.

fixes and general improvements for both direct\r\ndcrwallet command line users and other projects building on top of dcrwallet\r\n(such as Decrediton and upcoming mobile wallets).  A comprehensive list of\r\nimprovements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes were made to which and how many addresses and wallet UTXOs are watched\r\n  by the SPV and RPC syncers.  This prevents several bugs resulting from missed\r\n  transactions, such as avoiding double spending errors and spends of unknown\r\n  inputs.\r\n\r\n* Committed filter creation and validation is fixed on all ARM processors.\r\n  Previously, an ARM assembly optimization could produce incorrect output for\r\n  the siphash function.\r\n\r\n* During initial wallet creation, the database is now always cleanly closed\r\n  before the process exits.  Previously, this was a race and the new wallet\r\n  database may have been missing writes during the initialization step.\r\n\r\n* RPC connection errors to dcrd are now properly logged\r\n\r\n* A possible deadlock situation was removed by adding a missing mutex unlock to\r\n  the SPV peering implementation.\r\n\r\n* Error handling has been improved when querying unmined and unspent ticket\r\n  transactions.\r\n\r\n* The total number of logged transactions processed by the RPC syncer has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n* The process can be interrupted at startup if while being blocked on acquiring\r\n  the wallet's database lock.  Previously, the process would have needed to be\r\n  killed, or wait for an existing running wallet to shutdown.\r\n  \r\n* Fixed reorganizations failing with \"missing credit value\" errors.  This\r\n  was not a database corruption issue and a wallet restore is not necessary.\r\n\r\n* Fixed the block hash returned by gRPC `WalletService.GetTransaction`\r\n  responses.  This method was prevously using the transaction hash instead\r\n  of the hash of the block the transaction was mined in.\r\n\r\n* Fixed error handling in the RPC sync mode to ensure some synchronization\r\n  errors are not ignored.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` now returns pubkey of P2PKH\r\n  addresses and BIP0044 branch and child index if the address is controlled by\r\n  the wallet.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ImportScript` is now usable by watching-only\r\n  wallets.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.StakeInfo` now includes counts of unspent\r\n  tickets.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `TicketBuyerV2Service.RunTicketBuyer` has been added to run\r\n  the SPV-compatible ticket buyer.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTicket` has been added to query the\r\n  details of an individual ticket by its transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SweepAccount` has been added to sweep all\r\n  UTXOs of an account to a single new output.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.RpcSync` has been added, providing a similar\r\n  as `SpvSync` to perform wallet synchronization with a dcrd RPC connection.\r\n\r\n* The SPV and RPC syncers now support callbacks for syncing notifications.\r\n  These notifications are also availble to gRPC clients who invoke the syncers.\r\n\r\n* Creating a new simnet wallet now shows an address that can be used for mining\r\n  rewards.\r\n\r\n* RPC syncing connections to dcrd can now be proxied using the `--proxy`,\r\n  `--proxyuser`, and `--proxypass` options.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Builds have been converted to use Go Modules.  The repository has been split\r\n  into various submodules, making it far easier to write applications that\r\n  import dcrwallet packages as libraries.\r\n\r\n* Wallet database API is exported for projects that need support for alternative\r\n  database drivers (such as dcrandroid).\r\n\r\n* Default transaction relay fee has been dropped to 0.0001 DCR/kB.\r\n\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation is improved for ticket purchases and any\r\n  transaction that redeems a P2SH output.\r\n\r\n* DCP0001-0003 now apply to simnet from the start of the chain (note that this\r\n  is a hard fork for existing simnets).\r\n\r\n* Log files are never automatically deleted.  Previously, log files would be\r\n  rotated and old log files would be automatically removed.  This has been\r\n  changed to avoid the loss of potentially important logs.\r\n\r\n* Logs for unexpected database consistency issues have been improved by logging\r\n  the keys and values\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0).\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.4.0-rc2\r\n\r\nThis decrediton release has been mostly dedicated to fixing nagging issues\r\nwith users and cleaning up styling and design overall.  We are also happy to\r\ninclude new features such as: alpha Trezor support, initial alternative color themes,\r\nenhanced Governance/Politeia integration and a prominent page to choose SPV or normal mode.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to introduce initial Trezor hardware wallet support.  This includes\r\nthe ability to create transactions in decrediton and then sign them with the\r\nconnected device.  We will be working hard to add staking on Trezor in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAlternative color themes have been a constantly suggested feature since the\r\nlaunch of decrediton. We have added an initial proof of concept for a dark theme\r\ntoggle.  The colors are not yet final and design will hopefully provide a series\r\nof possible themes instead of simply light and dark.  \r\n\r\nThis release is the first to directly ask users on startup whether or not they \r\nwould like to use SPV mode or not.  This will hopefully increase SPV usage and \r\nprovide better/faster wallet support for most users.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Trezor integration has been added.  This allows users to essentially use \r\n  decrediton as watch-only wallet that is able to have its transactions signed\r\n  directly by their Trezor device.  Staking isn't yet currently available, but\r\n  we'll be looking in to adding that soon.  While we have tested and verified\r\n  this initial Trezor integration, we will hold off on prominently advertising \r\n  this until we can fully confirm it is bug free and secure.  \r\n\r\n* Decrediton has switched to using the ticketbuyer v2 service from the wallet \r\n  (instead of the old v1). Given that after [DCP-0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) the \r\n  ticket price has been stable, there's no need for that many configuration \r\n  parameters anymore. Version 2 of the ticket buyer needs to be configured only \r\n  with the source account, target stakepool and how much balance should be left \r\n  spendable. The buyer will then purchase as many tickets as possible, while \r\n  maintaining that balance.\r\n\r\n* Launcher Sync Stream.  Now both modes (SPV/RPC) both use the same notification\r\n  types to update during launching.  This helps with being able to allow dcrwallet\r\n  to handle all of the syncing and simply just update on similiar notifications.\r\n  Previously, there were situations that were causing issues since syncing steps\r\n  would be done out of order.\r\n\r\n* All users will see a new page on first load that lets them select whether or\r\n  not they would like to enable SPV mode.  We have also added a link to a newly\r\n  created document explaining everything about [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv).\r\n\r\n* We have added an early proof of concept for color theme toggling.  The colors\r\n  for the added dark theme are still being finalized by design, but the button\r\n  can be found on the Settings page.\r\n\r\n* Whenever a panic is detected by decrediton in dcrd or dcrwallet, users are now\r\n  sent to a seperate fatal error screen where they will be able to copy the logs\r\n  to be able to provide them to the developers and support.  This will hopefully\r\n  help users receive better direction to alleviate issues that are hitting.\r\n\r\n* Notifications have been completed restyled and fixed to allow for multiple\r\n  simultaneous notifications.  There is now a prominent closer button and timer\r\n  for automatic notification closing. \r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Eeter and kylefirethought have delivered a whole new set of animated menu icons.\r\n  These can be seen when hovering over a given menu page tab.  \r\n\r\n* The Governance Page has received a large styling overhaul as provided by Eeter\r\n  LLC.  Most importantly, notification bubbles have been added to let users\r\n  know when there are new proposals and votes to see.\r\n\r\n* Various clean up and refinement to the launcher.  There were issues in SPV mode\r\n  that were causing confusion about whether it was waiting to connect to a\r\n  daemon to proceed or not.  Now it should always be clear to the user when they\r\n  need to resolve something to proceed or if they should expect to wait for\r\n  something to happen.\r\n\r\n* We have updated some error messages to better explain to users what the\r\n  problem is and how it can be resolved.\r\n\r\n* Watch-only wallets are now able to create unsigned transactions that can be\r\n  transferred to an unlocked wallet for signing and subsequent broadcasting.\r\n\r\n* Add an import script button to the Add Stakepool form.  There are some users\r\n  that wish to simply import their script without having to communicate with any\r\n  outside sources.\r\n\r\n* The min default relay fee was updated in dcrd a few releases ago and now the\r\n  network has sufficiently upgraded to allow for wallet software to use 0.0001\r\n  DCR/kB as the default.  Any transaction or ticket created in decrediton or \r\n  dcrwallet should now use that minimum fee from now on.\r\n\r\n* Change to use the documentation subsystem to add the release notes.  This will\r\n  allow us to be more flexible when adding new release notes and letting users\r\n  review older ones.\r\n\r\n* Add decrediton logs to the Logs tab underneath the Help page.\r\n\r\n* With the addition of `getblockchaininfo` json-rpc command in dcrd, we are\r\n  now able to properly determine the progress of dcrd syncing.  This removes the\r\n  need to use outside sources to figure out know the syncing progress.\r\n\r\n* Transactions are now decoded within decrediton instead of being sent back to \r\n  dcrwallet for decoding.  This should help with performance to avoid an\r\n  unnecessary request.\r\n\r\n* Chinese language has been extensively reviewed by long time Asian community \r\n  contributor @Guang168\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* There were various issues with the display of recent staking transactions on\r\n  the Overview and the My Tickets pages. \r\n\r\n* Startup stats have been fixed to properly update and work better for large wallets \r\n\r\n* The application About button in macOS now also opens the About modal.\r\n\r\n* CSV exporting now correctly generates timestamps in UTC or local time based \r\n  on app config (thanks to @rocknet for the first contribution).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...release-v1.4)."}

and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [dcrd](#dcrd-v140rc1)\r\n* [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v140rc1)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v140rc1)\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.4.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd contains smart fee estimation, performance enhancements for\r\nblock relay and processing, a major internal restructuring of how unspent\r\ntransaction outputs are handled, support for whitelisting inbound peers to\r\nensure service for your own SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets,\r\nvarious updates to the RPC server such as a new method to query the state of the\r\nchain and more easily supporting external RPC connections over TLS,\r\ninfrastructure improvements, and other quality assurance changes.\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to this latest release as it\r\ncontains many important scalability improvements and smart fee estimation.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.4.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a lengthy one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Smart Fee Estimation (`estimatesmartfee`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `estimatesmartfee` is now available which returns a suitable\r\nfee rate for transactions to use in order to have a high probability of them\r\nbeing mined within a specified number of confirmations.  The estimation is based\r\non actual network usage and thus varies according to supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThis is important in the context of the Lightning Network (LN) and, more\r\ngenerally, it provides services and users with a mechanism to choose how to\r\nhandle network congestion.  For example, payments that are high priority might\r\nbe willing to pay a higher fee to help ensure the transaction is mined more\r\nquickly, while lower priority payments might be willing to wait longer in\r\nexchange for paying a lower fee.  This estimation capability provides a way to\r\nobtain a fee that will achieve the desired result with a high probability.\r\n\r\n### Support for Whitelisting Inbound Peers\r\n\r\nWhen peers are whitelisted via the `--whitelist` option, they will now be\r\nallowed to connect even when they would otherwise exceed the maximum number of\r\npeers.  This is highly useful in cases where users have configured their wallet\r\nto use SPV mode and only connect to dcrd instances that they control for\r\nincreased privacy and guaranteed service.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous releases, this release also contains several enhancements to\r\nimprove speed for the initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a lengthy one time database\r\nmigration, as previously mentioned, that typically takes anywhere from 30\r\nminutes to an hour to complete depending on hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Faster Tip Block Relay\r\n\r\nBlocks that extend the current best chain are now relayed to the network\r\nimmediately after they pass the initial sanity and contextual checks, most\r\nnotably valid proof of work.  This allows blocks to propagate more quickly\r\nthroughout the network, which in turn improves vote times.\r\n\r\n#### UTXO Set Restructuring\r\n\r\nThe way the unspent transaction outputs are handled internally has been\r\noverhauled to significantly decrease the time it takes to validate block and\r\ntransactions.  While this has many benefits, probably the most important one\r\nfor most stakeholders is that votes can be cast more quickly which helps reduce\r\nthe number of missed votes.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New Chain State Query RPC (`getblockchaininfo`)\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getblockchaininfo` is now available which can be used to query\r\nthe state of the chain including details such as its overall verification\r\nprogress during initial sync, the maximum supported block size, and that status\r\nof consensus changes (deployments) which require stakeholder votes.  See the\r\n[JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md#getblockchaininfo)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of Vote Creation RPC (`createrawssgen`)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `createrawssgen`, which was previously used to allow creating a\r\nvote via RPC is no longer available.  Votes are time sensitive and thus it does\r\nnot make sense to create them offline.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Block and Transaction RPCs\r\n\r\nThe `getblock`, `getblockheader`, and `getrawtransaction`, and\r\n`searchrawtransactions` RPCs now contain additional information such as the\r\n`extradata` field in the header, the `expiry` field in transactions, and the\r\n`blockheight` and `blockindex` of  the block that contains a transaction if it\r\nhas been mined.  See the [JSON-RPC API Documentation](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.md)\r\nfor API details.\r\n\r\n#### Built-in Support for Enabling External TLS RPC Connections\r\n\r\nA new command line parameter (`--altdnsnames`) and environment variable\r\n(`DCRD_ALT_DNSNAMES`) can now be used before the first launch of drcd to specify\r\nadditional external IP addresses and DNS names to add during the certificate\r\ncreation that are permitted to connect to the RPC server via TLS.  Previously,\r\na separate tool was required to accomplish this configuration.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.3.0...release-v1.4.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n\r\n- chaincfg: Add checkpoints for 1.4.0 release ([decred/dcrd#1547](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1547))\r\n- peer: Add support for specifying ua comments ([decred/dcrd#1413](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1413))\r\n- blockmanager: Fast relay checked tip blocks ([decred/dcrd#1443](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1443))\r\n- multi: Latest consensus active from simnet genesis ([decred/dcrd#1482](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1482))\r\n- server: Always allow whitelisted inbound peers ([decred/dcrd#1516](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516))\r\n\r\n### Transaction relay (memory pool):\r\n\r\n- blockmanager: handle txs in invalid blocks ([decred/dcrd#1430](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1430))\r\n- mempool: Remove potential negative locktime check ([decred/dcrd#1455](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1455))\r\n- mempool: Stake-related readability improvements ([decred/dcrd#1456](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1456))\r\n\r\n### RPC:\r\n\r\n- multi: Include additional fields on RPC tx results ([decred/dcrd#1441](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1441))\r\n- rpcserver: Allow scripthash addrs in createrawsstx ([decred/dcrd#1444](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1444))\r\n- rpcserver: Remove createrawssgen RPC ([decred/dcrd#1448](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1448))\r\n- rpcclient: support getchaintips RPC ([decred/dcrd#1469](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1469))\r\n- multi: Add getblockchaininfo rpc ([decred/dcrd#1479](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1479))\r\n- rpcserver: Adds ability to allow alternative dns names for TLS ([decred/dcrd#1476](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1476))\r\n- multi: Cleanup recent alt DNS names additions ([decred/dcrd#1493](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1493))\r\n- multi: Cleanup getblock and getblockheader RPCs ([decred/dcrd#1497](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1497))\r\n- multi: Return total chain work in RPC results ([decred/dcrd#1498](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1498))\r\n- rpcserver: Improve GenerateNBlocks error message ([decred/dcrd#1507](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1507))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix verify progress calculation ([decred/dcrd#1508](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1508))\r\n- rpcserver: Fix sendrawtransaction error code ([decred/dcrd#1512](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1512))\r\n- blockchain: Notify stake states after connected block ([decred/dcrd#1515](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1515))\r\n- rpcserver: bump version to 5.0.

fixes and general improvements for both direct\r\ndcrwallet command line users and other projects building on top of dcrwallet\r\n(such as Decrediton and upcoming mobile wallets).  A comprehensive list of\r\nimprovements and bug fixes follows.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes were made to which and how many addresses and wallet UTXOs are watched\r\n  by the SPV and RPC syncers.  This prevents several bugs resulting from missed\r\n  transactions, such as avoiding double spending errors and spends of unknown\r\n  inputs.\r\n\r\n* Committed filter creation and validation is fixed on all ARM processors.\r\n  Previously, an ARM assembly optimization could produce incorrect output for\r\n  the siphash function.\r\n\r\n* During initial wallet creation, the database is now always cleanly closed\r\n  before the process exits.  Previously, this was a race and the new wallet\r\n  database may have been missing writes during the initialization step.\r\n\r\n* RPC connection errors to dcrd are now properly logged\r\n\r\n* A possible deadlock situation was removed by adding a missing mutex unlock to\r\n  the SPV peering implementation.\r\n\r\n* Error handling has been improved when querying unmined and unspent ticket\r\n  transactions.\r\n\r\n* The total number of logged transactions processed by the RPC syncer has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n* The process can be interrupted at startup if while being blocked on acquiring\r\n  the wallet's database lock.  Previously, the process would have needed to be\r\n  killed, or wait for an existing running wallet to shutdown.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` now returns pubkey of P2PKH\r\n  addresses and BIP0044 branch and child index if the address is controlled by\r\n  the wallet.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.ImportScript` is now usable by watching-only\r\n  wallets.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.StakeInfo` now includes counts of unspent\r\n  tickets.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `TicketBuyerV2Service.RunTicketBuyer` has been added to run\r\n  the SPV-compatible ticket buyer.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTicket` has been added to query the\r\n  details of an individual ticket by its transaction hash.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SweepAccount` has been added to sweep all\r\n  UTXOs of an account to a single new output.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.RpcSync` has been added, providing a similar\r\n  as `SpvSync` to perform wallet synchronization with a dcrd RPC connection.\r\n\r\n* The SPV and RPC syncers now support callbacks for syncing notifications.\r\n  These notifications are also availble to gRPC clients who invoke the syncers.\r\n\r\n* Creating a new simnet wallet now shows an address that can be used for mining\r\n  rewards.\r\n\r\n* RPC syncing connections to dcrd can now be proxied using the `--proxy`,\r\n  `--proxyuser`, and `--proxypass` options.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Builds have been converted to use Go Modules.  The repository has been split\r\n  into various submodules, making it far easier to write applications that\r\n  import dcrwallet packages as libraries.\r\n\r\n* Wallet database API is exported for projects that need support for alternative\r\n  database drivers (such as dcrandroid).\r\n\r\n* Default transaction relay fee has been dropped to 0.0001 DCR/kB.\r\n\r\n* Transaction size and fee estimation is improved for ticket purchases and any\r\n  transaction that redeems a P2SH output.\r\n\r\n* DCP0001-0003 now apply to simnet from the start of the chain (note that this\r\n  is a hard fork for existing simnets).\r\n\r\n* Log files are never automatically deleted.  Previously, log files would be\r\n  rotated and old log files would be automatically removed.  This has been\r\n  changed to avoid the loss of potentially important logs.\r\n\r\n* Logs for unexpected database consistency issues have been improved by logging\r\n  the keys and values\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0).\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.4.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis decrediton release has been mostly dedicated to fixing nagging issues\r\nwith users and cleaning up styling and design overall.  We are also happy to\r\ninclude new features such as: alpha Trezor support, initial alternative color themes,\r\nenhanced Governance/Politeia integration and a prominent page to choose SPV or normal mode.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to introduce initial Trezor hardware wallet support.  This includes\r\nthe ability to create transactions in decrediton and then sign them with the\r\nconnected device.  We will be working hard to add staking on Trezor in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAlternative color themes have been a constantly suggested feature since the\r\nlaunch of decrediton. We have added an initial proof of concept for a dark theme\r\ntoggle.  The colors are not yet final and design will hopefully provide a series\r\nof possible themes instead of simply light and dark.  \r\n\r\nThis release is the first to directly ask users on startup whether or not they \r\nwould like to use SPV mode or not.  This will hopefully increase SPV usage and \r\nprovide better/faster wallet support for most users.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Trezor integration has been added.  This allows users to essentially use \r\n  decrediton as watch-only wallet that is able to have its transactions signed\r\n  directly by their Trezor device.  Staking isn't yet currently available, but\r\n  we'll be looking in to adding that soon.  While we have tested and verified\r\n  this initial Trezor integration, we will hold off on prominently advertising \r\n  this until we can fully confirm it is bug free and secure.  \r\n\r\n* Decrediton has switched to using the ticketbuyer v2 service from the wallet \r\n  (instead of the old v1). Given that after [DCP-0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki) the \r\n  ticket price has been stable, there's no need for that many configuration \r\n  parameters anymore. Version 2 of the ticket buyer needs to be configured only \r\n  with the source account, target stakepool and how much balance should be left \r\n  spendable. The buyer will then purchase as many tickets as possible, while \r\n  maintaining that balance.\r\n\r\n* Launcher Sync Stream.  Now both modes (SPV/RPC) both use the same notification\r\n  types to update during launching.  This helps with being able to allow dcrwallet\r\n  to handle all of the syncing and simply just update on similiar notifications.\r\n  Previously, there were situations that were causing issues since syncing steps\r\n  would be done out of order.\r\n\r\n* All users will see a new page on first load that lets them select whether or\r\n  not they would like to enable SPV mode.  We have also added a link to a newly\r\n  created document explaining everything about [SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv).\r\n\r\n* We have added an early proof of concept for color theme toggling.  The colors\r\n  for the added dark theme are still being finalized by design, but the button\r\n  can be found on the Settings page.\r\n\r\n* Whenever a panic is detected by decrediton in dcrd or dcrwallet, users are now\r\n  sent to a seperate fatal error screen where they will be able to copy the logs\r\n  to be able to provide them to the developers and support.  This will hopefully\r\n  help users receive better direction to alleviate issues that are hitting.\r\n\r\n* Notifications have been completed restyled and fixed to allow for multiple\r\n  simultaneous notifications.  There is now a prominent closer button and timer\r\n  for automatic notification closing. \r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Eeter and kylefirethought have delivered a whole new set of animated menu icons.\r\n  These can be seen when hovering over a given menu page tab.  \r\n\r\n* The Governance Page has received a large styling overhaul as provided by Eeter\r\n  LLC.  Most importantly, notification bubbles have been added to let users\r\n  know when there are new proposals and votes to see.\r\n\r\n* Various clean up and refinement to the launcher.  There were issues in SPV mode\r\n  that were causing confusion about whether it was waiting to connect to a\r\n  daemon to proceed or not.  Now it should always be clear to the user when they\r\n  need to resolve something to proceed or if they should expect to wait for\r\n  something to happen.\r\n\r\n* We have updated some error messages to better explain to users what the\r\n  problem is and how it can be resolved.\r\n\r\n* Watch-only wallets are now able to create unsigned transactions that can be\r\n  transferred to an unlocked wallet for signing and subsequent broadcasting.\r\n\r\n* Add an import script button to the Add Stakepool form.  There are some users\r\n  that wish to simply import their script without having to communicate with any\r\n  outside sources.\r\n\r\n* The min default relay fee was updated in dcrd a few releases ago and now the\r\n  network has sufficiently upgraded to allow for wallet software to use 0.0001\r\n  DCR/kB as the default.  Any transaction or ticket created in decrediton or \r\n  dcrwallet should now use that minimum fee from now on.\r\n\r\n* Change to use the documentation subsystem to add the release notes.  This will\r\n  allow us to be more flexible when adding new release notes and letting users\r\n  review older ones.\r\n\r\n* Add decrediton logs to the Logs tab underneath the Help page.\r\n\r\n* With the addition of `getblockchaininfo` json-rpc command in dcrd, we are\r\n  now able to properly determine the progress of dcrd syncing.  This removes the\r\n  need to use outside sources to figure out know the syncing progress.\r\n\r\n* Transactions are now decoded within decrediton instead of being sent back to \r\n  dcrwallet for decoding.  This should help with performance to avoid an\r\n  unnecessary request.\r\n\r\n* Chinese language has been extensively reviewed by long time Asian community \r\n  contributor @Guang168\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* There were various issues with the display of recent staking transactions on\r\n  the Overview and the My Tickets pages. \r\n\r\n* Startup stats have been fixed to properly update and work better for large wallets \r\n\r\n* The application About button in macOS now also opens the About modal.\r\n\r\n* CSV exporting now correctly generates timestamps in UTC or local time based \r\n  on app config (thanks to @rocknet for the first contribution).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0-rc1)."}

[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\r\n\r\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run [decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.3.1/decrediton-1.3.1.tar.gz) or [decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.3.1/decrediton-v1.3.1.dmg) or [decrediton Windows](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.3.1/decrediton-v1.3.1.exe).\r\n\r\nSee manifest-v1.3.1.txt, and the package specific manifest files for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.3.1\r\n\r\nThis is primarily a patch release for Decrediton, but also reveals some exciting\r\nnew functionality to the entire user base.  Previously, SPV wallet functionality\r\nand Politeia access were hidden behind configuration settings (which were only\r\naccessible by knowledgeable users).  Now Politeia is seen by default underneath\r\nthe new \"Governance\" page that can be found on the left sidebar.  SPV can be\r\nenabled by going to the Settings page and updating the option (this will\r\ncause decrediton to reset to begin using the systems correctly).\r\n\r\nWe are also proud to add our first round of translations.  We have added French,\r\nSpanish, German, Japanese, Chinese (simplified).  If you are a long standing \r\ncommunity member and notice any incorrect translations you can open an issue on\r\n[github](https://www.github.com/decred/decrediton/issues) or contact the team on\r\nthe slack/matrix chat platforms.  While we appreciate input from all users,\r\nthe translation process demands some existing trust, so we'd prefer only users\r\nwith existing relationships with the project submit translation issues.  We're\r\nattempting to formalize our translations procedures to allow input from more\r\nusers.  Our goal is to provide the same high quality content for all users, no\r\nmatter their preferred language. Our tentative next list of languages are:\r\nRussian, Arabic, Malay/Tagalog.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* The underlying dcrwallet was updated to include a required fix that caused\r\n  panics in some wallets with certain transactions (typically stakepool fee txs).\r\n\r\n* Non-US languages were causing some odd strings to be shown.\r\n\r\n* Use streaming GetTickets with dcrwallet to ease decrediton loading.  Now tickets\r\n  are requested on a smaller basis to avoid issues with very large voting wallets.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Add proper wallet and daemon closing procedures to allow settings changes for\r\n  SPV and Advanced Daemon.  Now the user does not have to completely close the\r\n  wallet to enable these changes.  There is also an added button to close the\r\n  current wallet and select a new one to load.  \r\n\r\n* The transaction details page has received a design update from Eeter.  We have\r\n  added the \"Rebroadcast Transaction\" button if the transaction is \"Pending.\" \r\n  This should be close to the final form of the page with some minor tweaks.\r\n\r\n* Updated Help page with more links and updated design from Eeter.\r\n\r\n* Update major some major dependencies and others: Webpack 4, Electron 2.0.8\r\n\r\n* Retain number of tickets to purchase upon unsuccessful attempt.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/release-v1.3.0...release-v1.3.1).\r\n"}

2018-09-21\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nTo install the command line tools, please see [dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\r\n\r\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run [decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.3.0/decrediton-v1.3.0.tar.gz) or [decrediton

Windows](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.3.0/decrediton-v1.3.0.exe).\r\n\r\nSee manifest-v1.3.0.txt, and the package specific manifest files for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [dcrd](#dcrd-v130)\r\n* [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v130)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v130)\r\n\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.3.0\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd contains significant performance enhancements for startup\r\nspeed, validation, and network operations that directly benefit lightweight\r\nclients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, a policy change\r\nto reduce the default minimum transaction fee rate, a new public test network\r\nversion, removal of bloom filter support, infrastructure improvements, and other\r\nquality assurance changes.\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to this latest release as it\r\ncontains many important scalability improvements and is required to be able to\r\nuse the new public test network.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.3.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Reduction of Default Minimum Transaction Fee Rate Policy\r\n\r\nThe default setting for the policy which specifies the minimum transaction fee\r\nrate that will be accepted and relayed to the rest of the network has been\r\nreduced to 0.0001 DCR/kB (10,000 atoms/kB) from the previous value of 0.001\r\nDCR/kB (100,000 atoms/kB).\r\n\r\nTransactions should not attempt to use the reduced fee rate until the majority\r\nof the network has upgraded to this release as otherwise the transactions will\r\nlikely have issues relaying through the network since old nodes that have not\r\nupdated their policy will reject them due to not paying a high enough fee.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nThis release contains several enhancements to improve speed for startup,\r\nthe initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as\r\npreviously mentioned, that typically only takes a few seconds to complete on\r\nmost hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Further Improved Startup Speed\r\n\r\nThe startup time has been improved by roughly 2x on both slower hard disk drives\r\n(HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) as compared to v1.2.0.\r\n\r\n#### Significantly Faster Network Operations\r\n\r\nThe ability to serve information to other peers on the network has received\r\nseveral optimizations which, in addition to generally improving the overall\r\nscalability and throughput of the network, also directly benefits SPV\r\n(Simplified Payment Verification) clients by delivering the block headers they\r\nrequire roughly 3x to 4x faster.\r\n\r\n#### Signature Hash Calculation Optimization\r\n\r\nPart of validating that transactions are only spending coins that the owner has\r\nauthorized involves ensuring the validity of cryptographic signatures.  This\r\nrelease provides a speedup of about 75% to a key portion of that validation\r\nwhich results in a roughly 20% faster initial sync process.\r\n\r\n### Bloom Filters Removal\r\n\r\nBloom filters were deprecated as of the last release in favor of the more recent\r\nprivacy-preserving GCS committed filters.  Consequently, this release removes\r\nsupport for bloom filters completely.  There are no known clients which use\r\nbloom filters, however, if there are any unknown clients which use them, those\r\nclients will need to be updated to use the GCS committed filters accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Public Test Network Version 3\r\n\r\nThe public test network has been reset and bumped to version 3.  All of the new\r\nconsensus rules voted in by version 2 of the public test network have been\r\nretained and are therefore active on the new version 3 test network without\r\nhaving to vote them in again.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.2.0...release-v1.3.0).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and

bringing initial simplified payment verification (SPV)\r\nand committed filter (CF) support to dcrwallet as an optional, experimental\r\nsynchronization mode.  As usual, the release also contains various other\r\nimprovements and bug fixes, iterated below.\r\n\r\nThis release contains a database upgrade and once upgraded it is not possible to\r\ndowngrade to previous wallet releases without performing a seed restore with the\r\nold version.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* When code executing under a database transaction panics, the transaction is\r\n  now rolled back.  Closing the transaction avoids a deadlock when closing the\r\n  database in the case that the panic is recovered instead of crashing the\r\n  process.\r\n\r\n* Deleting private keys from the database no longer modifies the database with\r\n  an active bucket cursor.  Doing so is unsafe and has been the cause of\r\n  database corruption in the past.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC method `version` no longer panics dereferencing a nil dcrd RPC\r\n  client when one does not exist or has not been associated with the server.\r\n\r\n* Callers of an internal method to return unencrypted scripts have been fixed\r\n  for a breaking API change in the case that the script was not present.  This\r\n  subsequently fixes synchronization from exiting prematurely when various\r\n  scripts were not recorded.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC method `signrawtransaction` has been fixed to avoid a panic in\r\n  cases where an unknown input must have been fetched from dcrd, and the input\r\n  is already spent in the main chain.\r\n\r\n* Fee estimation when spending a P2SH output has been fixed by considering the\r\n  nested script length instead of using the same size estimation performed when\r\n  spending a P2PKH output.\r\n\r\n* gRPC transaction notifications now handle the case of a transaction being\r\n  invalidated by voters in the next block.  An invalidated transaction is\r\n  considered to have -1 confirmations, but in most cases the transaction (if not\r\n  double spent) will reappear in mempool with a confirmation count of 0.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* A SPV synchronization mode has been introduced.  SPV may be enabled with the\r\n  --spv config option.  The SPV sync mode uses local committed filter matching\r\n  (as opposed to remote filtering as commonly done in other SPV implementations)\r\n  to provide greater privacy and security guarantees by only fetching complete\r\n  blocks on matches.  SPV mode uses the Decred wire protocol and peer-to-peer\r\n  network to sync to a target 8 outbound peers.  The --spvconnect option is\r\n  provided to manually specify the addresses of outbound peers rather than\r\n  discovering these over DNS and from other peers.\r\n\r\n* A new ticket buyer implementation has been added.  This buyer does not rely on\r\n  any features unavailable to SPV mode.  All config options which only apply to\r\n  the original ticket buyer are now deprecated, and using only options available\r\n  to the new buyer will cause the new buyer to be run instead.  It is not\r\n  possible to use the deprecated ticket buyer with SPV.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet` has been added to allow the\r\n  creation of a watching-only wallet for an account extended pubkey.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `SignTransactions` has been added to sign multiple\r\n  transactions in a single method.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `ConstructTransaction` now returns the index of any added\r\n  change output, or -1 if no change was added.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `GetAccountExtendedKey` has been added to return an account's\r\n  extended pubkey.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `SpvSync` has been added to execute the SPV synchronizer.\r\n  This RPC returns a message stream used to notify clients of the syncer's\r\n  activity.\r\n\r\n* A new config option --accountgaplimit allows the number of unused accounts to\r\n  be user-configurable.  The default has been dropped from 100 unused accounts\r\n  to 10 to improve performance of account rediscovery.  This option may be set\r\n  to 100 to restore the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC `getstakeinfo` result has been modified to include two new\r\n  fields.  `unspent` returns the number of tickets that have not been spent by a\r\n  vote or revocation, and `unspentexpired` returns the number of unspent tickets\r\n  that are past ticket expiry and cannot possibly be live.  Unlike the `missed`\r\n  and `expired` fields, these new fields are populated when running in SPV mode.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Unnecessarily-verbose debug logs have been removed when filtering ticket\r\n  hashes for owned tickets.\r\n\r\n* The walletdb and snacl packages have been made internal packages to prevent\r\n  these from being exposed by the public API.  This is part of an ongoing effort\r\n  to support module-aware builds with vgo and Go 1.11.\r\n\r\n* The error message for the unsupported operation of calling the JSON-RPC method\r\n  `listtransactions` with an account name been improved by adding a hint to use\r\n  `*` instead.\r\n\r\n* `go vet` is now tested by the CI infrastructure and several string formatting\r\n  issues discovered by `vet` have been resolved.\r\n\r\n* The operating system and machine architecture are now logged at process\r\n  startup together with the wallet release and Go versions.\r\n\r\n* The description for the --createtemp config option now references the\r\n  requirement of additionally setting --appdata rather than the deprecated\r\n  --datadir option.\r\n\r\n* Input amounts of previous outputs are now set before signing transactions.\r\n  This will be required as proposed signature hash algorithms commit to the\r\n  input amount.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.2.0...release-v1.3.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.3.0\r\n\r\nThis release of Decrediton marks the dawn of a large milestone in development.\r\nSPV (simple payment verification) has been added in dcrwallet which allows\r\nwallets to connect directly to peers and not required a fully synced node to be\r\nconnected.  For now this feature will be turned OFF by default, then when we \r\nhave gotten thorough feedback and a confident in the usage, it will be turned\r\non by default.\r\n\r\nWhile it's hard to give details of speed increases due to variances in systems,\r\nwe've seen roughly a 5x increase in syncing a previously used seed to tip on \r\nmainnet.  Previously, syncing the chain would take roughly 1hr plus another 5-10\r\nmins for the wallet to become synced.  Now, we're seeing about 20mins total time\r\nto being able to fully use a wallet to send or purchase tickets.\r\n\r\nIn the coming releases, we are going to work on further speeding this process up,\r\nas well as providing more feedback from dcrwallet to Decrediton to make a\r\nricher user experience.\r\n\r\n*Note: Automatic ticket purchasing has been disabled for SPV.  We will be\r\nimplementing a way to start and stop the new v2 ticketbuyer in dcrwallet.  This\r\nnew version is much simpler and really only has 1 option to set which would\r\nbe an absolute balance to maintain.  This new version will also allow users to\r\nrun multiple ticket purchases for each account.\r\n\r\nThis release also has been audited by our design team at Eeter, LLC.  Most of the\r\npages have received an update to the styling to add more polish and be more \r\nresilient to various sizing and displays.  In the near future, we will be \r\nfocusing on color themes and window sizing for small, medium and large displays.  \r\n\r\nWe are also proud to announce the intial release of the Politeia integration.\r\nWhile this functionality is still in beta-testing, what you see will be roughly\r\nthe final form.  Proposals up for vote will be shown and your possible tickets\r\nwill be compared to the proposal's allowed tickets to vote.  If there are\r\ntickets available to vote, you simply make your choice, enter your passphrase\r\nand your tickets are used to send the Politeia server your cryptographic proof\r\nof ownership.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* SPV integration - *Note: This integration is currently hidden from normal \r\nusage, if you would like to test it, please set `\"spv_mode\": true`, in your \r\n`config.json` file.  With this new integration, there has been a new way of \r\nsyncing that has been added.  Now instead of needing to do all of the wallet \r\nloader processes in the proper order, one can simply call the SpvSync grpc and\r\nthat will handle everything within dcrwallet.  This will lead to much less\r\nerrors and other headaches down the road.  We have also added an\r\n`\"spv_connect\": [],` option in the `config.json` file, which will allow users to\r\nconnect directly to a known peer instead of relying on the DNS seeders to find\r\npeers.\r\n\r\n* Whitelisting and Proxy - We have added new support to control the connections\r\nto domains that are used for various information.  We have also added proxy\r\nsupport for those that choose to have the extra security.  These were both\r\nnecessary since the addition of Politeia wallet's communicating with the outside\r\nworld.  We felt the users should have full control over where the wallet is\r\ncommunicating.  This support will be further improved upon in future releases\r\nand requests for things are made.\r\n\r\n* Initial Politeia Integration - *Note: This integration is currently hidden\r\nfrom normal usage, but can be accessed by setting `\"politeia_beta\": true`, in\r\nyour `config.json` file.  When activated the user is shown a new page on the\r\nside bar menu, reading \"Governance.\"  This will show them the Politeia\r\ninformation, of which is pulled from a request to the proposals site. \r\nThey will be shown currently live and past votes.  \r\n\r\n* Animated Onboarding Slides - All new animated slides were added.  Big thanks\r\nfor all the hard work from @kyleFirethought and everyone at Eeter! They really\r\nmake the wallet shine.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Launcher - The launcher UI was audited and has most of its issues smoothed\r\nout.  There were some lingering issues and possible ways of users to get \"stuck\"\r\nwhile loading up their wallets.\r\n\r\n* Inputs and Errors - All inputs have been audited for consistency and proper\r\ninput error states are now being used.  We are very pleased with the look and\r\nfeel of the input errors and believe they are not too intrusive for users while\r\nbeing very clear of what needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\n* Max Wallet Option - Users are now able to set the max wallets that are\r\nshown on the launcher screen.  The default is currently set to 3.  But keep in\r\nmind that it was styled assuming only 3 would be shown, so there may be some\r\ndistortions as the number shown grows.  \r\n\r\n* Refined About Modal - The additional window was removed in favor of a React\r\nmodal.  This allowed us to clean up the code and remove a redundant menu bar\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n* Long Form Translations - Due issues translating large pieces of text that were\r\nsplit up into partial sentences, we are now keeping large sections of\r\ndocumentation that need to be translated together.  This is for things like the\r\nonboarding slides and various informational modals. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.2.1...release-v1.3.0)."}

"zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/decred/decred-binaries/zipball/v1.3.0-rc2", "body": "# dcrd v1.3.0-rc2\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd contains significant performance enhancements for startup\r\nspeed, validation, and network operations that directly benefit lightweight\r\nclients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, a policy change\r\nto reduce the default minimum transaction fee rate, a new public test network\r\nversion, removal of bloom filter support, infrastructure improvements, and other\r\nquality assurance changes.\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to this latest release as it\r\ncontains many important scalability improvements and is required to be able to\r\nuse the new public test network.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.3.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Reduction of Default Minimum Transaction Fee Rate Policy\r\n\r\nThe default setting for the policy which specifies the minimum transaction fee\r\nrate that will be accepted and relayed to the rest of the network has been\r\nreduced to 0.0001 DCR/kB (10,000 atoms/kB) from the previous value of 0.001\r\nDCR/kB (100,000 atoms/kB).\r\n\r\nTransactions should not attempt to use the reduced fee rate until the majority\r\nof the network has upgraded to this release as otherwise the transactions will\r\nlikely have issues relaying through the network since old nodes that have not\r\nupdated their policy will reject them due to not paying a high enough fee.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nThis release contains several enhancements to improve speed for startup,\r\nthe initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as\r\npreviously mentioned, that typically only takes a few seconds to complete on\r\nmost hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Further Improved Startup Speed\r\n\r\nThe startup time has been improved by roughly 2x on both slower hard disk drives\r\n(HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) as compared to v1.2.0.\r\n\r\n#### Significantly Faster Network Operations\r\n\r\nThe ability to serve information to other peers on the network has received\r\nseveral optimizations which, in addition to generally improving the overall\r\nscalability and throughput of the network, also directly benefits SPV\r\n(Simplified Payment Verification) clients by delivering the block headers they\r\nrequire roughly 3x to 4x faster.\r\n\r\n#### Signature Hash Calculation Optimization\r\n\r\nPart of validating that transactions are only spending coins that the owner has\r\nauthorized involves ensuring the validity of cryptographic signatures.  This\r\nrelease provides a speedup of about 75% to a key portion of that validation\r\nwhich results in a roughly 20% faster initial sync process.\r\n\r\n### Bloom Filters Removal\r\n\r\nBloom filters were deprecated as of the last release in favor of the more recent\r\nprivacy-preserving GCS committed filters.  Consequently, this release removes\r\nsupport for bloom filters completely.  There are no known clients which use\r\nbloom filters, however, if there are any unknown clients which use them, those\r\nclients will need to be updated to use the GCS committed filters accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Public Test Network Version 3\r\n\r\nThe public test network has been reset and bumped to version 3.  All of the new\r\nconsensus rules voted in by version 2 of the public test network have been\r\nretained and are therefore active on the new version 3 test network without\r\nhaving to vote them in again.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.2.0...release-v1.3.0-rc2).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and

enhancements for startup\r\nspeed, validation, and network operations that directly benefit lightweight\r\nclients, such as SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets, a policy change\r\nto reduce the default minimum transaction fee rate, a new public test network\r\nversion, removal of bloom filter support, infrastructure improvements, and other\r\nquality assurance changes.\r\n\r\n**It is highly recommended that everyone upgrade to this latest release as it\r\ncontains many important scalability improvements and is required to be able to\r\nuse the new public test network.**\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.3.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Reduction of Default Minimum Transaction Fee Rate Policy\r\n\r\nThe default setting for the policy which specifies the minimum transaction fee\r\nrate that will be accepted and relayed to the rest of the network has been\r\nreduced to 0.0001 DCR/kB (10,000 atoms/kB) from the previous value of 0.001\r\nDCR/kB (100,000 atoms/kB).\r\n\r\nTransactions should not attempt to use the reduced fee rate until the majority\r\nof the network has upgraded to this release as otherwise the transactions will\r\nlikely have issues relaying through the network since old nodes that have not\r\nupdated their policy will reject them due to not paying a high enough fee.\r\n\r\n### Several Speed Optimizations\r\n\r\nThis release contains several enhancements to improve speed for startup,\r\nthe initial sync process, validation, and network operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as\r\npreviously mentioned, that typically only takes a few seconds to complete on\r\nmost hardware.\r\n\r\n#### Further Improved Startup Speed\r\n\r\nThe startup time has been improved by roughly 2x on both slower hard disk drives\r\n(HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) as compared to v1.2.0.\r\n\r\n#### Significantly Faster Network Operations\r\n\r\nThe ability to serve information to other peers on the network has received\r\nseveral optimizations which, in addition to generally improving the overall\r\nscalability and throughput of the network, also directly benefits SPV\r\n(Simplified Payment Verification) clients by delivering the block headers they\r\nrequire roughly 3x to 4x faster.\r\n\r\n#### Signature Hash Calculation Optimization\r\n\r\nPart of validating that transactions are only spending coins that the owner has\r\nauthorized involves ensuring the validity of cryptographic signatures.  This\r\nrelease provides a speedup of about 75% to a key portion of that validation\r\nwhich results in a roughly 20% faster initial sync process.\r\n\r\n### Bloom Filters Removal\r\n\r\nBloom filters were deprecated as of the last release in favor of the more recent\r\nprivacy-preserving GCS committed filters.  Consequently, this release removes\r\nsupport for bloom filters completely.  There are no known clients which use\r\nbloom filters, however, if there are any unknown clients which use them, those\r\nclients will need to be updated to use the GCS committed filters accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Public Test Network Version 3\r\n\r\nThe public test network has been reset and bumped to version 3.  All of the new\r\nconsensus rules voted in by version 2 of the public test network have been\r\nretained and are therefore active on the new version 3 test network without\r\nhaving to vote them in again.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.2.0...release-v1.3.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and

dcrwallet as an optional, experimental\r\nsynchronization mode.  As usual, the release also contains various other\r\nimprovements and bug fixes, iterated below.\r\n\r\nThis release contains a database upgrade and once upgraded it is not possible to\r\ndowngrade to previous wallet releases without performing a seed restore with the\r\nold version.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* When code executing under a database transaction panics, the transaction is\r\n  now rolled back.  Closing the transaction avoids a deadlock when closing the\r\n  database in the case that the panic is recovered instead of crashing the\r\n  process.\r\n\r\n* Deleting private keys from the database no longer modifies the database with\r\n  an active bucket cursor.  Doing so is unsafe and has been the cause of\r\n  database corruption in the past.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC method `version` no longer panics dereferencing a nil dcrd RPC\r\n  client when one does not exist or has not been associated with the server.\r\n\r\n* Callers of an internal method to return unencrypted scripts have been fixed\r\n  for a breaking API change in the case that the script was not present.  This\r\n  subsequently fixes synchronization from exiting prematurely when various\r\n  scripts were not recorded.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC method `signrawtransaction` has been fixed to avoid a panic in\r\n  cases where an unknown input must have been fetched from dcrd, and the input\r\n  is already spent in the main chain.\r\n\r\n* Fee estimation when spending a P2SH output has been fixed by considering the\r\n  nested script length instead of using the same size estimation performed when\r\n  spending a P2PKH output.\r\n\r\n* gRPC transaction notifications now handle the case of a transaction being\r\n  invalidated by voters in the next block.  An invalidated transaction is\r\n  considered to have -1 confirmations, but in most cases the transaction (if not\r\n  double spent) will reappear in mempool with a confirmation count of 0.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* A SPV synchronization mode has been introduced.  SPV may be enabled with the\r\n  --spv config option.  The SPV sync mode uses local committed filter matching\r\n  (as opposed to remote filtering as commonly done in other SPV implementations)\r\n  to provide greater privacy and security guarantees by only fetching complete\r\n  blocks on matches.  SPV mode uses the Decred wire protocol and peer-to-peer\r\n  network to sync to a target 8 outbound peers.  The --spvconnect option is\r\n  provided to manually specify the addresses of outbound peers rather than\r\n  discovering these over DNS and from other peers.\r\n\r\n* A new ticket buyer implementation has been added.  This buyer does not rely on\r\n  any features unavailable to SPV mode.  All config options which only apply to\r\n  the original ticket buyer are now deprecated, and using only options available\r\n  to the new buyer will cause the new buyer to be run instead.  It is not\r\n  possible to use the deprecated ticket buyer with SPV.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet` has been added to allow the\r\n  creation of a watching-only wallet for an account extended pubkey.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `SignTransactions` has been added to sign multiple\r\n  transactions in a single method.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `ConstructTransaction` now returns the index of any added\r\n  change output, or -1 if no change was added.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `GetAccountExtendedKey` has been added to return an account's\r\n  extended pubkey.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `SpvSync` has been added to execute the SPV synchronizer.\r\n  This RPC returns a message stream used to notify clients of the syncer's\r\n  activity.\r\n\r\n* A new config option --accountgaplimit allows the number of unused accounts to\r\n  be user-configurable.  The default has been dropped from 100 unused accounts\r\n  to 10 to improve performance of account rediscovery.  This option may be set\r\n  to 100 to restore the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC `getstakeinfo` result has been modified to include two new\r\n  fields.  `unspent` returns the number of tickets that have not been spent by a\r\n  vote or revocation, and `unspentexpired` returns the number of unspent tickets\r\n  that are past ticket expiry and cannot possibly be live.  Unlike the `missed`\r\n  and `expired` fields, these new fields are populated when running in SPV mode.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Unnecessarily-verbose debug logs have been removed when filtering ticket\r\n  hashes for owned tickets.\r\n\r\n* The walletdb and snacl packages have been made internal packages to prevent\r\n  these from being exposed by the public API.  This is part of an ongoing effort\r\n  to support module-aware builds with vgo and Go 1.11.\r\n\r\n* The error message for the unsupported operation of calling the JSON-RPC method\r\n  `listtransactions` with an account name been improved by adding a hint to use\r\n  `*` instead.\r\n\r\n* `go vet` is now tested by the CI infrastructure and several string formatting\r\n  issues discovered by `vet` have been resolved.\r\n\r\n* The operating system and machine architecture are now logged at process\r\n  startup together with the wallet release and Go versions.\r\n\r\n* The description for the --createtemp config option now references the\r\n  requirement of additionally setting --appdata rather than the deprecated\r\n  --datadir option.\r\n\r\n* Input amounts of previous outputs are now set before signing transactions.\r\n  This will be required as proposed signature hash algorithms commit to the\r\n  input amount.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.2.0...release-v1.3.0-rc1).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.3.0-rc1\r\n\r\nThis release of Decrediton marks the dawn of a large milestone in development.\r\nSPV (simple payment verification) has been added in dcrwallet which allows\r\nwallets to connect directly to peers and not required a fully synced node to be\r\nconnected.  For now this feature will be turned OFF by default, then when we \r\nhave gotten thorough feedback and a confident in the usage, it will be turned\r\non by default.\r\n\r\nWhile it's hard to give details of speed increases due to variances in systems,\r\nwe've seen roughly a 5x increase in syncing a previously used seed to tip on \r\nmainnet.  Previously, syncing the chain would take roughly 1hr plus another 5-10\r\nmins for the wallet to become synced.  Now, we're seeing about 20mins total time\r\nto being able to fully use a wallet to send or purchase tickets.\r\n\r\nIn the coming releases, we are going to work on further speeding this process up,\r\nas well as providing more feedback from dcrwallet to Decrediton to make a\r\nricher user experience.\r\n\r\n*Note: Automatic ticket purchasing has been disabled for SPV.  We will be\r\nimplementing a way to start and stop the new v2 ticketbuyer in dcrwallet.  This\r\nnew version is much simpler and really only has 1 option to set which would\r\nbe an absolute balance to maintain.  This new version will also allow users to\r\nrun multiple ticket purchases for each account.\r\n\r\nThis release also has been audited by our design team at Eeter, LLC.  Most of the\r\npages have received an update to the styling to add more polish and be more \r\nresilient to various sizing and displays.  In the near future, we will be \r\nfocusing on color themes and window sizing for small, medium and large displays.  \r\n\r\nWe are also proud to announce the intial release of the Politeia integration.\r\nWhile this functionality is still in beta-testing, what you see will be roughly\r\nthe final form.  Proposals up for vote will be shown and your possible tickets\r\nwill be compared to the proposal's allowed tickets to vote.  If there are\r\ntickets available to vote, you simply make your choice, enter your passphrase\r\nand your tickets are used to send the Politeia server your cryptographic proof\r\nof ownership.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* SPV integration - *Note: This integration is currently hidden from normal \r\nusage, if you would like to test it, please set `\"spv_mode\": true`, in your \r\n`config.json` file.  With this new integration, there has been a new way of \r\nsyncing that has been added.  Now instead of needing to do all of the wallet \r\nloader processes in the proper order, one can simply call the SpvSync grpc and\r\nthat will handle everything within dcrwallet.  This will lead to much less\r\nerrors and other headaches down the road.  We have also added an\r\n`\"spv_connect\": [],` option in the `config.json` file, which will allow users to\r\nconnect directly to a known peer instead of relying on the DNS seeders to find\r\npeers.\r\n\r\n* Whitelisting and Proxy - We have added new support to control the connections\r\nto domains that are used for various information.  We have also added proxy\r\nsupport for those that choose to have the extra security.  These were both\r\nnecessary since the addition of Politeia wallet's communicating with the outside\r\nworld.  We felt the users should have full control over where the wallet is\r\ncommunicating.  This support will be further improved upon in future releases\r\nand requests for things are made.\r\n\r\n* Initial Politeia Integration - *Note: This integration is currently hidden\r\nfrom normal usage, but can be accessed by setting `\"politeia_beta\": true`, in\r\nyour `config.json` file.  When activated the user is shown a new page on the\r\nside bar menu, reading \"Governance.\"  This will show them the Politeia\r\ninformation, of which is pulled from a request to the proposals site. \r\nThey will be shown currently live and past votes.  \r\n\r\n* Animated Onboarding Slides - All new animated slides were added.  Big thanks\r\nfor all the hard work from @kyleFirethought and everyone at Eeter! They really\r\nmake the wallet shine.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Launcher - The launcher UI was audited and has most of its issues smoothed\r\nout.  There were some lingering issues and possible ways of users to get \"stuck\"\r\nwhile loading up their wallets.\r\n\r\n* Inputs and Errors - All inputs have been audited for consistency and proper\r\ninput error states are now being used.  We are very pleased with the look and\r\nfeel of the input errors and believe they are not too intrusive for users while\r\nbeing very clear of what needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\n* Max Wallet Option - Users are now able to set the max wallets that are\r\nshown on the launcher screen.  The default is currently set to 3.  But keep in\r\nmind that it was styled assuming only 3 would be shown, so there may be some\r\ndistortions as the number shown grows.  \r\n\r\n* Refined About Modal - The additional window was removed in favor of a React\r\nmodal.  This allowed us to clean up the code and remove a redundant menu bar\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n* Long Form Translations - Due issues translating large pieces of text that were\r\nsplit up into partial sentences, we are now keeping large sections of\r\ndocumentation that need to be translated together.  This is for things like the\r\nonboarding slides and various informational modals. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.2.1...release-v1.3.0-rc1)."}

Most importantly this fixes an issue causing \r\nbalances to show 0 after new blocks connect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix an issue that was causing non-dirs to be discovered as valid legacy wallets.\r\n  This would cause \"config.json\" incompletely setup wallet on first load of v1.2.0\r\n\r\n* Fix balance showing 0 after ticket/votes calculated for maturity.  \r\n\r\n* Seed pasting was not showing errors and would just blank out the words.  Now\r\n  an error is shown when that occurs.\r\n\r\n* Fix various PT-Br translation errors.\r\n\r\n* Due to dcrd v1.2.0 database upgrade, users would be shown \"Waiting for RPC...\" \r\n  for a very long time with no other information.  Now the first lines of both\r\n  dcrd and dcrwallet logs are shown to hopefully give the user more information\r\n  about the current state of the daemon upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.2.0...release-v1.2.1).\r\n"}

improved access to chain-related information for\r\nproviding better SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) support, and other\r\nquality assurance changes.\r\n\r\nA significant amount of infrastructure work has also been done this release\r\ncycle towards being able to support several planned scalability optimizations.\r\n\r\n## Downgrade Warning\r\n\r\nThe database format in v1.2.0 is not compatible with previous versions of the\r\nsoftware.  This only affects downgrades as users upgrading from previous\r\nversions will see a one time database migration.\r\n\r\nOnce this migration has been completed, it will no longer be possible to\r\ndowngrade to a previous version of the software without having to delete the\r\ndatabase and redownload the chain.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Significantly Faster Startup\r\n\r\nThe startup time has been improved by roughly 17x on slower hard disk drives\r\n(HDDs) and 8x on solid state drives (SSDs).\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these speedups, there is a one time database migration, as\r\npreviously mentioned, that will likely take a while to complete (typically\r\naround 5 to 6 minutes on HDDs and 2 to 3 minutes on SSDs).\r\n\r\n### Support For DNS Seed Filtering\r\n\r\nIn order to better support the forthcoming SPV wallets, support for finding\r\nother peers based upon their enabled services has been added.  This is useful\r\nfor both SPV wallets and full nodes since SPV wallets will require access to\r\nfull nodes in order to retrieve the necessary proofs and full nodes are\r\ngenerally not interested in making outgoing connections to SPV wallets.\r\n\r\n### Committed Filters\r\n\r\nWith the intention of supporting light clients, such as SPV wallets, in a\r\nprivacy-preserving way while still minimizing the amount of data that needs to\r\nbe downloaded, this release adds support for committed filters.  A committed\r\nfilter is a combination of a probalistic data structure that is used to test\r\nwhether an element is a member of a set with a predetermined collision\r\nprobability along with a commitment by consensus-validating full nodes to that\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nA committed filter is created for every block which allows light clients to\r\ndownload the filters and match against them locally rather than uploading\r\npersonal data to other nodes.\r\n\r\nA new service flag is also provided to allow clients to discover nodes that\r\nprovide access to filters.\r\n\r\nThere is a one time database update to build and store the filters for all\r\nexisting historical blocks which will likely take a while to complete (typically\r\naround 2 to 3 minutes on HDDs and 1 to 1.5 minutes on SSDs).\r\n\r\n### Updated Atomic Swap Contracts\r\n\r\nThe standard checks for atomic swap contracts have been updated to ensure the\r\ncontracts enforce the secret size for safer support between chains with\r\ndisparate script rules.\r\n\r\n### RPC Server Changes\r\n\r\n#### New `getchaintips` RPC\r\n\r\nA new RPC named `getchaintips` has been added which allows callers to query\r\ninformation about the status of known side chains and their branch lengths.\r\nIt currently only provides support for side chains that have been seen while the\r\ncurrent instance of the process is running.  This will be further improved in\r\nfuture releases.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub

SPV work\r\nis ongoing but these changes will not land until a future release and after most\r\nof the network nodes are running with committed filter support.\r\n\r\nThis release contains a database upgrade and once upgraded it is not possible\r\nto downgrade to previous wallet releases without performing a seed restore with\r\nthe old version.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Orphan votes (votes which have become invalid for the new main chain tip block\r\n  after a reorg or missed vote) are now rejected from reentering the wallet if\r\n  still notified by dcrd.\r\n\r\n* Watching only wallets are now usable again, after a breaking change to them\r\n  introduced in the 1.1.2 release.\r\n\r\n* The transaction fee when purchasing tickets with the `purchaseticket` JSON-RPC\r\n  and `WalletService.PurchaseTickets` gRPC methods will now fallback to the\r\n  wallet's configured fee rate if not specified by the RPC request.\r\n\r\n* Various gRPC methods which allowed specifying 0 DCR as a target amount (e.g.\r\n  `WalletService.FundTransaction`) now follow their documentation and will\r\n  return or use as many unspent outputs as possible.\r\n\r\n* Outputs of transactions with an expiry set are not spendable by consensus\r\n  rules until having reached coinbase maturity.  These outputs are no longer\r\n  returned or used when selecting previous outputs to create new transactions.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.UnspentOutputs` has been added to return a\r\n  stream of all wallet unspent outputs.  Outputs may be filtered by their\r\n  associated account and required confirmations, as well as stopping once a\r\n  total target amount has been reached or exceeded.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.BestBlock` has been added which will return\r\n  the hash and height of the current main chain tip block.  Previously, this\r\n  information was only available as a unary RPC with the\r\n  `WalletService.Accounts` method.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC method `WalletService.GetTickets` will paginate results if called\r\n  with a new target ticket count parameter.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.CommittedTickets` has been added to find\r\n  ticket purchase hashes specified by the request where the largest P2PKH\r\n  commitment amount is controlled by the wallet.  The commitment address is\r\n  additionally returned by the result.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.SignMessages` has been added to sign multiple\r\n  messages at a time without needing to unlock and lock the wallet before and\r\n  after each call.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC `BlockDetails` and `BlockInfoResponse` messages now include a new\r\n  field which specifies whether votes in the block disapprove of the parent\r\n  block.\r\n\r\n* A new JSON-RPC method `publishunminedtransactions` has been added which\r\n  resends all unmined transactions of the wallet.\r\n\r\n* A new JSON-RPC method `sweepaccount` has been added which can be used to move\r\n  as much value as possible from an account to either (possibly the same)\r\n  account or an address.  This RPC can be used in place of the `consolidate`\r\n  method but without knowing and specifying exactly how many inputs to use.\r\n\r\n* The new JSON-RPC methods `startautobuyer` and `stopautobuyer` have been added\r\n  which can start and stop the automatic ticket purchaser over JSON-RPC, similar\r\n  to the already existing `StartAutoBuyer` and `StopAutoBuyer` gRPC methods of\r\n  the `TicketBuyerService`.\r\n\r\n* The JSON-RPC method `getbalance` now returns aggregate balances for all\r\n  accounts if called with the special `*` account name.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* The sendtosstx, sendtossgen, and sendtossrtx JSON-RPC methods have been\r\n  removed.  These RPCs were intended to manually send ticket purchases, votes,\r\n  and revocations manually, but were unimplemented and would cause crashes if\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n* Transaction size estimation has been improved to more accurately estimate\r\n  fees, in particular when redeeming with pay-to-script-hash redeem scripts.\r\n\r\n* The `help` JSON-RPC method text for the `getbalance` RPC has been updated to\r\n  reflect the changes made to the returned object.\r\n\r\n* Users are now informed with log messages to configure their public passphrase\r\n  or enter it on startup if the wallet is encrypted with one but it was not\r\n  specified.\r\n\r\n* Script execution errors during sanity checks after signing inputs now record\r\n  additional information about the failure including the previous output and\r\n  script being spent and the signature script used by the input.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.1.2...v1.2.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton 1.2.0\r\n\r\nThis release of decrediton adds some major changes to the wallet startup,\r\noverview page and adds the first round of statistics for better user\r\ninformation.  Now that the overall look and feel designed by Eeter has been\r\nimpletmented we will be focusing on refinement and adding improved\r\nresponsiveness (eg dark mode, resolving to various media widths).\r\n\r\nLauncher has been redesigned to provide the user with a more intuitive startup\r\nexperience.  In normal working mode, the daemon (of the chosen network) will\r\nbegin to sync and become operational while the user completes wallet\r\ncreation/selection.  Then once both the wallet is ready and the daemon has\r\nsynced the wallet will fully load.\r\n\r\nA tutorial, release notes, settings and logs have all been added to the\r\nlauncher for the user to utilize whilst they may be waiting for their daemon\r\nto sync.  Hopefully this will allow the user to more seamlessly create wallets\r\nwith less confusion or require any additional support.\r\n\r\nThe wallet creation by seed has received a substantial update as well.  We now\r\nallow the user to copy seeds (if they complete a warning screen) and also paste\r\nseeds.  And for confirmation for new wallets only requires the user to complete\r\n1/3 of the words to confirm storage of wallet's seed.\r\n\r\nOverview has been redesigned to give the user more information about their\r\nwallet's current situation and to guide them where to find various features\r\nof their wallet.  Basic graphs covering balances, tickets and transactions have\r\nbeen added.  All recent transactions and recent ticket activity can be found\r\nbelow the overview graphs.  We will be adding more features to the overview page\r\nas we gauge user interest and feedback on existing additions.\r\n\r\nIntroductory data prepartion and statistics have been implemented for this\r\nrelease.  For now we are providing a small window of lookback for transactions,\r\nstaking and other information.  The reduced window size is mostly an issue\r\nwith unsatisfactory performance.  When this performance improves, we will be\r\nadding custom windows and window lengths for custom graphing and exporting\r\noptions.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n\r\n* Validate Addresses - a form to validate addresses has been added to the\r\n  Security Center.  This will allow users to test addresses to confirm address\r\n  ownership and/or validity.\r\n\r\n* Filter by address - now transactions can be filtered by address in History.\r\n  When the user enters a string into the address filter form, it will show any\r\n  address that has an output with a matching address.\r\n\r\n* Charts - we have decided to use [recharts](https://recharts.org) as our first\r\n  charting solution.\r\n\r\n* Import wallet from hex seed - instead of entering in the 33 word\r\n  mnemonic, they are now able to use the hex representation of their seed.\r\n\r\n* Export data to CSV - we now all users to export various types of data to csv.\r\n  These options are found under the Transactions page.\r\n\r\n* Show logs - logs can now be found on the launcher and on the help page.\r\n  For now, we only show the logs of the current instance of wallet and daemon.\r\n  This is mostly due to performance with pulling in thousands of lines of text.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.1.3...v1.2.0)."}

patch release covers a few commonly reported issues shortly\r\nafter v1.1.2 was released.  Most importantly this fixes a random issue on \r\nthe Windows version that was causing an unavoidable crash on startup.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Rollback electron-store/conf version to avoid asar/json Windows issue.\r\n\r\n* Remove \"Revoke tickets...\" alert from Overview.  Due to a deeper issue in\r\n  dcrwallet the notification whether there are tickets to revoke is being\r\n  incorrectly announced.  Until that fix is available, it seems better to avoid\r\n  showing the alert which confuses the user.\r\n\r\n* Fix errors on adding Stakepool API.  On failed Stakepool API requests, the \r\n  Stakey bounce animation would remain and the user would be unable to proceed.\r\n\r\n* Fix sorting of voted/revoked tickets in My Tickets.\r\n\r\n* Fix Account Key display\r\n\r\n* Fix issue with using \"Enter\" to complete any Get Started form.  Doing so\r\n  would previously make Decrediton shut down instead of submitting the action.\r\n\r\n* Hide Paginator when <= 1 page\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.1.2...v1.1.3)."}

[dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v112)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v112)\r\n\r\n\r\n# dcrd v1.1.2\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd primarily contains performance enhancements, infrastructure\r\nimprovements, and other quality assurance changes.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not visible in this release, significant infrastructure work has\r\nalso been done this release cycle towards porting the Lightning Network (LN)\r\ndaemon which will ultimately allow LN payments to be backed by Decred.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Faster Block Validation\r\n\r\nA significant portion of block validation involves handling the stake tickets\r\nwhich form an integral part of Decred's hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake\r\nsystem.  The code which handles this portion of validation has been\r\nsignificantly optimized in this release such that overall block validation is\r\nup to approximately 3 times faster depending on the specific underlying hardware\r\nconfiguration.  This also has a noticeable impact on the speed of the initial\r\nblock download process as well as how quickly votes for winning tickets are\r\nsubmitted to the network.\r\n\r\n### Data Carrier Transaction Standardness Policy\r\n\r\nThe standard policy for transaction relay of data carrier transaction outputs\r\nhas been modified to support canonically-encoded small data pushes.  These\r\noutputs are also known as `OP_RETURN` or `nulldata` outputs.  In particular,\r\nsingle byte small integers data pushes (0-16) are now supported.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub

As always, it also comes with bug fixes, new features and other\r\nimprovements, which are detailed below.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Vote transactions that become invalid when the main chain tip block changes\r\n  are now removed from the wallet.  This allows the invalid vote to be double\r\n  spent by another vote later if the ticket is picked again on a different\r\n  chain.\r\n\r\n* Ticket buyer now attempts to avoid purchasing tickets for old blocks if it is\r\n  enabled while the wallet is catching up to the network.\r\n  \r\n* The application now exits cleanly if an interrupt signal (e.g. ^C or SIGINT)\r\n  is received while at a prompt (such as during wallet creation, or with\r\n  `--promptpass`) instead of hanging at the prompt.\r\n\r\n* The application no longer refuses to start when duplicate RPC listener\r\n  addresses which bind to port 0 are specified in the config.\r\n\r\n* The `listtransactions` JSON-RPC has been fixed so that the order and amount\r\n  values of all results match the results returned by Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n* The `gettransaction` JSON-RPC has been fixed to return fees as negative\r\n  numbers instead of positive, which matches the behavior of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.GetTickets` has been introduced to return all\r\n  wallet ticket purchases between a block range.  The results are streamed to\r\n  the client.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.ValidateAddress` has been added with similar\r\n  semantics and usage to the `validateaddress` JSON-RPC method.  It can be used\r\n  to decode an address string, ensuring that it is a valid address, as well as\r\n  returning whether the address is owned by the wallet.\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC service `DecodeMessageService` has been introduced to make it\r\n  easier for clients not able to decode raw Decred wire messages themselves to\r\n  decode a message into a gRPC message.  Currently, one method exists in the\r\n  service, `DecodeRawTransaction`, which decodes a Decred transaction.\r\n\r\n* Pagination support has been added to the `WalletService.GetTransactions`\r\n  method through the introduction of a new `target_transaction_count` parameter\r\n  in the request.  Responses are immediately streamed to the client when the\r\n  target is reached.\r\n\r\n* The TX IPC pipe has been added (enabled with the `pipetx` option) to receive\r\n  messages from the application by a parent process.  When combined with the\r\n  `rpclistenerevents` option, this allows the application to inform the parent\r\n  process of the listener addresses used by the gRPC and JSON-RPC servers.  This\r\n  is especially useful when binding listeners to port 0 as the application is\r\n  able to report the actual port chosen by the operating system to the parent\r\n  process.\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Vendoring management of dependency source code has been switched from `glide`\r\n  to `dep`.  See the README.md for new build instructions.\r\n\r\n* The BIP0044 coin type has been seamlessly upgraded from the old Decred value\r\n  of 20 to 42.  The new coin type is the coin type reserved for Decred in\r\n  [SLIP0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) and\r\n  will allow greater compatibility with third party wallets.  New wallets are\r\n  always created with the new coin type, but for legacy compatibility old\r\n  wallets and seed restores which have address usage with the old coin type will\r\n  not be upgraded.\r\n\r\n* The address discovery algorithm has been made more concurrent and should see\r\n  performance improvements, especially on CPUs with high core counts.\r\n\r\n* Performance improvements were made to the `WalletService.GetTransactions` gRPC\r\n  method by avoiding unnecessary JSON-RPC calls to dcrd.\r\n\r\n* The `ticketaddress` option has been deprecated and replaced by the\r\n  `ticketbuyer.votingaddress` option.\r\n\r\n* Publishing duplicate vote transactions in a redundant voting wallet setup no\r\n  longer logs an error for a rejected duplicate transaction.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.2).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.1.2\r\n\r\nThis release marks a major turning point in our overall look and feel of \r\nDecrediton. We have introduced consistent header areas with a new subpage/tab \r\ninterface.  React-motion has been added to give a better feel for transitions\r\nfrom page to page and expanded area reveals.  All information modals and\r\npassphrase modals have been consolidated to have a consistent feel whenever they\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nAs part of the design overhaul, the Tickets page has begun its transformation\r\nto provide a much better user experience.  My Tickets subpage is the first step\r\ninto giving users a clearer picture into their current staking situation.  In\r\nthe upcoming release, we will be adding extensive statistics and graphing to\r\nfurther help visualize a given users' balance and staking history.  Overall,\r\nwe aim to continue to add more tools that will help users' staking experience\r\nbe much more enjoyable and carefree.\r\n\r\nWe have also added advanced daemon setup abilities for users that want to use\r\nremote daemons or use a different location for their blockchain data.  In the \r\nnext release, we plan on also adding the ability to handle advanced back-end\r\nwallet setups: easily switch between different wallet files on the same machine,\r\nconnecting to a remote wallet and other possible situations.  But these advanced\r\noptions will also be completely transparent for users that choose to run with \r\nthe default settings.\r\n\r\nWe have added a Security Center page that will be a catch-all place to \r\nstore tools that we feel have utility, but aren't needed for everyday normal\r\nwallet operation.  The first 2 tools that have been added are for Signing and\r\nVerifying messages using addresses and private keys to prove ownership of a\r\ngiven address.  Here is a typical use case:  User A wants to prove to User B \r\nthat they control a given address.  With the Sign Message tool, User A enters\r\nthe address, a message and their wallet's private passphrase.  The tool produces\r\na hash that was created based on that address' private key and the given\r\nmessage.  With the Verify Message tool, User B can use the address in question,\r\nthe hash and the message from User A to verify that it was signed using that\r\naddress' private key.\r\n\r\nWe are also happy to announce the introduction of internationalization.  \r\nBrazilian Portuguese has been added for the first pass and we will be slowly \r\nadding more languages on every new release.\r\n\r\nThings to expect in the next release: \r\n\r\n- New overview page design\r\n- Rich historical Statistics/Graphs\r\n- New staking account user experience\r\n- Advanced wallet settings\r\n- More languages translated\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issue on Windows caused by using \"Aux\" as a filename.  Aux is a restricted\r\n  filename with Windows and a simple filename change fixed it.\r\n\r\n* Fix shutdown issue with macOS.  When cmd-Q or quitting Decrediton from the\r\n  dock caused dcrd and dcrwallet to not be shutdown in the background.  By \r\n  adding a final closeClis() in app.on(\"before-quit\",...) it ensures that\r\n  everything is closed on any shutdown.\r\n\r\n* Removed Skip Sync button due to the new slip44 change in dcrwallet.  With the\r\n  new coin type change, dcrwallet needs to check if there has been any address\r\n  usage up to that point in the chain for a given wallet.\r\n\r\n* Shorten account names in various areas to avoid obnoxious overflow.\r\n\r\n* Fix issue that was occuring when clearing out stakepool configurations.  This\r\n  would cause users to possibly have incorrect stakepool setups.  \r\n\r\n* Change functionality of the space key during seed entry.  Previously, when the\r\n  user would enter the space key they would end up not \"selecting\" a word and\r\n  then just type the whole seed.  Now the space \"selects\" the word just as\r\n  pressing tab does.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2).

release primarily fixes Windows version from not allowing dcrd and\r\ndcrwallet to be shutdown gracefully.  Upon decrediton close, shutdown requests\r\nare given to the 2 child-processes to cleanly shutdown now.\r\n\r\nThis commit also marks the first unit test of the React components we are\r\nincluding.   In the upcoming releases we plan on expanding test coverage to\r\nhopefully ensure that each release is as bug free as possible.\r\n\r\nWe can now get transaction details for pending transactions and the\r\ntransaction notifactions are clickable to see that details page.\r\n\r\nApp versions are now pulled directly from the binaries themselves instead\r\nof any hardcoding so users can be assured they are running specific versions\r\nof dcrd and dcrwallet underneath.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Disable rescan, add ApiKey and Import Script buttons if there is an\r\n  outstanding rescan request processing.  Otherwise you can issue multiple\r\n  requests at the same time and it will lead to unsightly UX.\r\n\r\n- Fix Stakepools Overview link that was resulting in a 404 previously.\r\n\r\n- Add total subsidy to the tickets page.\r\n\r\n- Fix Add Stakepool Button in Stakepool Config page.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1).\r\n"}

introduces a new consensus vote agenda which\r\nallows the stakeholders to decide whether or not to activate the features needed\r\nfor providing full support for Lightning Network.  For those unfamiliar with the\r\nvoting process in Decred, this means that all code in order to support these\r\nfeatures is already included in this release, however its enforcement will\r\nremain dormant until the stakeholders vote to activate it.\r\n\r\nThe following Decred Change Proposals (DCPs) describe the proposed changes in detail:\r\n- [DCP0002](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0002/dcp-0002.mediawiki)\r\n- [DCP0003](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0003/dcp-0003.mediawiki)\r\n\r\nIt is important for everyone to upgrade their software to this latest release\r\neven if you don't intend to vote in favor of the agenda.\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Lightning Network Features Vote\r\n\r\nIn order to fully support many of the benefits that the Lightning Network will\r\nbring, there are some primitives that involve changes to the current consensus\r\nthat need to be enabled.  A new vote with the id `lnfeatures` is now available\r\nas of this release.  After upgrading, stakeholders may set their preferences\r\nthrough their wallet or stake pool's website.\r\n\r\n### Transaction Finality Policy\r\n\r\nThe standard policy for transaction relay has been changed to use the median\r\ntime of the past several blocks instead of the current network adjusted time\r\nwhen examining lock times to determine if a transaction is final.  This provides\r\na more deterministic check across all peers and prevents the possibility of\r\nminers attempting to game the timestamps in order to include more transactions.\r\n\r\nConsensus enforcement of this change relies on the result of the aforementioned\r\n`lnfeatures` vote.\r\n\r\n### Relative Time Locks Policy\r\n\r\nThe standard policy for transaction relay has been modified to enforce relative\r\nlock times for version 2 transactions via their sequence numbers and a new\r\n`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` opcode.\r\n\r\nConsensus enforcement of this change relies on the result of the aforementioned\r\n`lnfeatures` vote.\r\n\r\n### OP_SHA256 Opcode\r\n\r\nIn order to better support cross-chain interoperability, a new opcode to compute\r\nthe SHA-256 hash is being proposed.  Since this opcode is implemented as a hard\r\nfork, it will not be available for use in scripts unless the aforementioned\r\n`lnfeatures` vote passes.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/v1.0.7...v1.1.0).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n- chaincfg: update checkpoints for 1.1.0 release

It also comes with the normal set of bug fixes and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Revocations can now be created which double spend an unmined vote, as long as\r\n  the vote is not voting on the most recent block.  This allows revocations to\r\n  be created for votes that were made but not included in the block by miners.\r\n\r\n* Tickets manually added through the `addticket` JSON-RPC method are now\r\n  included in the `gettickets` results.  This is required for correct stakepool\r\n  functionality.\r\n\r\n* An off-by-one was fixed when logging the number of watched addresses at wallet\r\n  startup.\r\n\r\n* A divide-by-zero error has been fixed when attempting to use the integrated\r\n  ticket buyer starting from the genesis block on simnet.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* A new gRPC method `WalletService.CreateSignature` has been added to create a\r\n  raw transaction input signature.  This is useful for clients that need to\r\n  include signatures in non-standard scripts without resorting to dumping a\r\n  private key and signing in the client.\r\n\r\n* The gRPC `WalletService.Balance` result has been updated to include the\r\n  unconfirmed balance.  This unconfirmed balance has the same semantics as the\r\n  unconfirmed field from the `getbalance` JSON-RPC result.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* The help text for the `addticket` JSON-RPC method has been updated to reflect\r\n  that fact that manually added tickets are not reported in the statistics\r\n  returned by the `getstakeinfo` method.\r\n\r\n* Added support for Go 1.9.  Release binaries are now created using this Go\r\n  version.\r\n\r\n* The sample config has been updated for the current configuration defaults.\r\n  This sample config had not been updated in the past when default config\r\n  options were changed.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.8...v1.1.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n# decrediton v1.1.0\r\n\r\nThis release decrediton is significant for a few newly added features and \r\nimprovements.  With the help of jrick, we are now able to control child \r\nprocesses properly in Windows and are now able to add Windows support.\r\n\r\nThe entire startup process has been refined to help users understand what is \r\nhappening behind the scenes.  Now it should be clear to users when the \r\nblockchain is downloading and what the consequences are for skipping intial \r\nsync.\r\n\r\nWe have also completed work on the initial phases of the React/Redux refactor.\r\nAll inline styles have been replaced with Less styling and all components \r\nhave been broken up into logic and presentation portions.  The next step will\r\nbe to audit and refactor the Redux state and ensure that everything is \r\nimmutable and recording proper state.\r\n\r\nThe following release will include a completely redesigned UX for staking.  We\r\nhope that this will make staking more approachable to new users.  We will also\r\nbe adding complete ticket status information and basic graphs for users to \r\nvisualize their accumulated returns from staking.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n* An \"About\" window now shows current decrediton version, plus versions of \r\n  packaged dcrd and dcrwallet binaries. This should help debug users' issues \r\n  going forward.\r\n\r\n* New startup procedure.  We now wait for dcrd's rpc connection to be available\r\n  and subsequently check block count.  We can now show users an estimated time\r\n  for full blockchain download.  This done by using a best guess according to \r\n  5 minutes per block and when the chain launched.  We plan on using more \r\n  intelligent methods of checking current block height in the future.\r\n\r\n* Send all.  Users can now construct transactions that will completely drain an\r\n  account.  Simply select the account you would like to send from, click \"Send\r\n  All\" then enter you destination address.  You will then be shown the\r\n  amount to be sent and the estimated fee.  Click send and enter your\r\n  private passphrase to complete the transaction.\r\n\r\n* Show rescan progress in sidebar.  This should help users avoid confusion\r\n  after linking ApiKeys or importing scripts.\r\n\r\n* Allow for basic resizing of the application window.  We are currently \r\n  designing fully implemented media size break points.  But in the meantime\r\n  this fix should allow users with low PPI screens to see the entire\r\n  application view.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Clear stakepool configurations when creating a new wallet.  Otherwise, users\r\n  could get into unintended situations with stakepool settings from one wallet\r\n  being attempted on another.  Other checks were still in place to avoid major\r\n  issues, but this led to undesirable UX.\r\n\r\n* Show pending transactions of all types in the overview and the history page.\r\n\r\n* Fix erroneous reloads and form submission in get started pages.\r\n\r\n* Settings were being saved on field change instead of Save Setting submit.\r\n\r\n* When using testnet, use different background color in SideBar to accentuate \r\n  that is is a different network.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrditon/compare/v1.0.8...v1.1.0).  Also see\r\nall changes to dcrwallet\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.8...v1.1.0).\r\n\r\n# Paymetheus v1.1.0\r\n\r\nThis release is likely to be the last, or one of the last, Paymetheus releases.\r\nWe have decided to unifiy efforts into development of our cross-platform GUI, \r\ndecrediton.  We will continue to search for interested WPF/xaml developers\r\nthat would like to continue development of this native Windows GUI. Users are\r\nencouraged to migrate to the Windows release of Decrediton by importing your\r\nPaymetheus seed.  In the meantime, this release of Paymetheus contains the\r\nupdates for voting on DCP0002 and DCP0003 and is intended as an interim release\r\nto smooth the migration process.\r\n\r\n"}

associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v108)\r\n* [Paymetheus](#paymetheus-v108)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v108)\r\n\r\n\r\n# dcrwallet v1.0.8\r\n\r\nThis release focused on minor bug fixes.  No new features have been added.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Tickets that are not owned by the wallet but are still recorded for spend\r\n  tracking purposes are skipped when generating the stake information and acting\r\n  on selected ticket notifications.  This prevents misreporting a high missed\r\n  count in the stake information and avoids trying to create and send unsigned\r\n  votes or revocations for tickets that can't be spent by the wallet.\r\n\r\n* gRPC transaction notifications for mined transactions now use the earliest of\r\n  the seen time and block time as their timestamp.  This prevents seed-restored\r\n  wallets from using the time of restore as the transaction time as well as\r\n  using the block time for any transactions received while the wallet was\r\n  offline.\r\n\r\n* gRPC services are no longer registered with the server after it has begun\r\n  serving and listening for clients.  This is a correctness fix for a data race\r\n  and a misuse of the gRPC package.  Delayed services such as the WalletService\r\n  still require a loaded wallet to be used and users of the API shouldn't notice\r\n  any difference.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Paymetheus v1.0.8\r\n\r\nThis release focused on under-the-hood improvements to the backend (dcrwallet)\r\ninstead of new features or UI changes.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Mined transactions now use the earliest of the seen time and the block time\r\n  for a timestamp.  This avoids simply showing every transaction arriving at the\r\n  time of restore when a wallet is seed restored, and also corrects the\r\n  timestamp for transactions received while the wallet was not running.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/Paymetheus/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8).  Also see\r\nall changes to dcrwallet\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8).\r\n\r\n\r\n## decrediton v1.0.8\r\n\r\nThis patch release fixes a critical bug that effected users that had multiple \r\nstakepools configured at the same time.  Periodically some stakepool settings \r\nwould get overwritten onto others which would cause pool fees to be incorrectly \r\nset for a given ticket.  If the pool fees were too low according to the stakepool,\r\nthey would be considered invalid.  If you believe you could have been effected \r\nby this issue, please check on your stakepool tickets page to see if you have \r\nany invalid tickets.  Then please contact your stakepool operator about getting \r\nthe tickets added and ready to be voted on.\r\n\r\nUpon upgrading to 1.0.8 it is recommended to delete your existing config.json \r\nlocated in your decrediton application directory.  Then restart your decrediton \r\nand re-enter your apikeys.  You may need to restart decrediton an extra time \r\nfor your stakepool list to populate. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub\r\n[here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8).

2017-08-17\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either [Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.7/decred_1.0.7-release_x64.msi) or [Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.7/decred_1.0.7-release_x86.msi) depending on your version of Windows.\r\n\r\nTo install the command line tools, please see [dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\r\n\r\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run [decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.7/decrediton-1.0.7.tar.gz) or [decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.7/decrediton-1.0.7.dmg).\r\n\r\nSee manifest-v1.0.7.txt, and the package specific manifest files for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [dcrd](#dcrd-v107)\r\n* [dcrwallet](#dcrwallet-v107)\r\n* [Paymetheus](#paymetheus-v107)\r\n* [decrediton](#decrediton-v107)\r\n\r\n\r\n## dcrd v1.0.7\r\n\r\nThis release of dcrd primarily contains improvements to the infrastructure and other quality assurance changes that are bringing us closer to providing full support for Lightning Network.\r\n\r\nA lot of work required for Lightning Network support went into getting the required code merged into the upstream project, btcd, which now fully supports it.  These changes also must be synced and integrated with dcrd as well and therefore many of the changes in this release are related to that process.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n### Dust check removed from stake transactions\r\n\r\nThe standard policy for regular transactions is to reject any transactions that have outputs so small that\r\nthey cost more to the network than their value.  This behavior is desirable for regular transactions, however\r\nit was also being applied to vote and revocation transactions which could lead to a situation where stake pools\r\nwith low fees could result in votes and revocations having difficulty being mined.\r\n\r\nThis check has been changed to only apply to regular transactions now in order to prevent any issues.  Stake\r\ntransactions have several other checks that make this one unnecessary for them.\r\n\r\n### New `feefilter` peer-to-peer message\r\n\r\nA new optional peer-to-peer message named `feefilter` has been added that allows peers to inform others about the minimum transaction fee rate they are willing to accept.  This will enable peers to avoid notifying others about transactions they will not accept anyways and therefore can result in a significant bandwith savings.\r\n\r\n### Bloom filter service bit enforcement\r\n\r\nPeers that are configured to disable bloom filter support will now disconnect remote peers that send bloom\r\nfilter related commands rather than simply ignoring them.  This allows any light clients that do not observe\r\nthe service bit to potentially find another peer that provides the service.  Additionally, remote peers that\r\nhave negotiated a high enough protocol version to observe the service bit and still send bloom filter\r\nrelated commands anyways will now be banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n##

All\r\nusers are recommended to upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis release also lays the groundwork for more staking features to be\r\nimplemented in future releases.  The wallet now tracks more details about all\r\ntickets and the votes or revocations that spend them.  In future releases, this\r\ncan be used to implement highly requested features such as detailed listings of\r\nall tickets, votes, and revocations and subsidy calculations.\r\n\r\n### Database upgrade notice\r\n\r\nThis release contains a wallet database upgrade.  Once upgraded, the database\r\ncan not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from\r\nseed or backup.  The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your\r\nwallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Gaps are no longer created between watched addresses.  This in turn fixes\r\n  issues where incoming transactions were not received by the wallet and\r\n  subsequently fixes various double spending and orphan transaction errors when\r\n  sending transactions or purchasing tickets.  Users affected by these issues\r\n  are asked to rescan or restore from seed after upgrading.\r\n\r\n* Adding multiple double spending unconfirmed transactions to the wallet no\r\n  longer corrupts spend tracking.\r\n \r\n* Database usage has been altered to avoid known data corruption issues caused\r\n  by Bolt cursors.\r\n \r\n* Wrapped address child indexes now continue to stay wrapped across wallet\r\n  restarts instead of returning to the highest returned child index.  This may\r\n  avoid unintended address reuse issues.\r\n \r\n* The first address of newly-created accounts is no longer skipped over when\r\n  generating addresses.\r\n \r\n* Handling of stake transactions has been rewritten to keep data consistent with\r\n  missed votes and blockchain reorganizations.\r\n \r\n* Balance reporting has been corrected for the voting authority and locked by\r\n  tickets balances by taking the ticket purchase's transaction fee into account.\r\n \r\n* The `sendtoaddress`, `sendfrom`, and `sendmany` JSON-RPC methods now verify\r\n  that the intended network of addresses in the request match the active\r\n  network.\r\n \r\n* Missing an explicitly specified config file now errors instead of only logging\r\n  a warning.\r\n \r\n### New features\r\n \r\n* The `signrawtransaction` JSON-RPC and `WalletService.SignTransaction` gRPC\r\n  methods are now capable of being used on offline wallets.\r\n \r\n* The `WalletService.SignMessage` and `MessageVerificationService.VerifyMessage`\r\n  gRPC methods have been introduced to add message signing and verification\r\n  features to the gRPC API.  These methods operate similarly to the\r\n  `signmessage` and `verifymessage` JSON-RPC methods.\r\n \r\n* The `getbalance` JSON-RPC method now includes fields for unconfirmed balances\r\n  of each account.  These balances are calculated as the spendable (by\r\n  consensus) balance which is not already included under the `spendable` field,\r\n  which is the spendable balance by both consensus rules and the minimum number\r\n  of required confirmations.  The addition of both fields equals the total\r\n  spendable-by-consensus balance.\r\n \r\n* Private passphrases can now be specified on the command line or in a config\r\n  file with the `--pass` option.  When used, the passphrase prompt at startup is\r\n  avoided when the auto ticket buyer is enabled.\r\n \r\n### Other improvements\r\n \r\n* The auto ticket buyer takes better advantage of the improved ticket price\r\n  algorithm by reducing the default maximum ticket purchase fee from 0.1/kB to\r\n  0.01/kB and reducing the maximum number of tickets purchased per block from 5\r\n  to 1.\r\n \r\n* Ticket purchases are now removed from the wallet once the ticket price\r\n  changes. As a result, the `--prunetickets` config option is no longer required\r\n  or useful and has been deprecated.\r\n \r\n* Performance enhancements have been made for the `getstakeinfo` JSON-RPC and\r\n  `WalletService.StakeInfo` gRPC methods.\r\n \r\n* The logger has been rewritten for improved performance.  Rolled log files are\r\n  now gzipped.\r\n \r\n* Error logs for duplicate script imports when the wallet is locked have been\r\n  removed.\r\n \r\n* Code quality has improved over several areas.\r\n \r\n### Changelog\r\n \r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.5...v1.0.7).\r\n \r\n \r\n## Paymetheus v1.0.7\r\n \r\nThis release focused on under-the-hood improvements to the backend (dcrwallet)\r\ninstead of new features or UI changes.  Users should no longer encounter double\r\nspend or orphan transaction errors sending transactions due to fixes for wallet\r\nspend tracking corruption, but a seed restore is necessary to fix\r\nalready-corrupted wallets.\r\n\r\n### Database upgrade notice\r\n \r\nThis release contains a wallet database upgrade.  Once upgraded, the database\r\ncan not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from\r\nseed or backup.  The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your\r\nwallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.\r\n \r\n### Bug fixes\r\n \r\n* Gaps are no longer created between watched addresses.

Extra care has been taken\r\nto ensure that users get as much information as possible to understand some\r\nof the innerworks of Decred.  But at the same time, ticket purchasing and other\r\nfeatures are actively being simplified and refined.  We have also added\r\nsome basic animations instead of the default loading screens.  We hope to\r\nintegrate several pieces of art and animations from our amazing community of \r\nartists.\r\n\r\nIn the coming releases we are expecting the following: Windows releases and\r\na completely revamped onboarding procedure.  This release is a step toward\r\nrealizng those goals.\r\n\r\nWe have also begun a complete refactor and reorganization of the React \r\ncomponents.  This [issue](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/528) describes the end goal of this project.\r\nIdeally, we will be able to make the UX/UI development open to all designers,\r\nwhich will allow for a true collborative effort.\r\n\r\n### Database upgrade notice\r\n \r\nThis release contains a wallet database upgrade.  Once upgraded, the database\r\ncan not be used on older releases and downgrading will require restoring from\r\nseed or backup.  The Decred project recommends ensuring you have access to your\r\nwallet seed before upgrading in case a downgrade is necessary.\r\n \r\n### Bug fixes\r\n \r\n* Gaps are no longer created between watched addresses.  This in turn fixes\r\n  issues where incoming transactions were not received by the wallet and\r\n  subsequently fixes various double spending and orphan transaction errors when\r\n  sending transactions or purchasing tickets.  Users affected by these issues\r\n  are asked to restore from seed after upgrading.\r\n \r\n* Adding multiple double spending unconfirmed transactions to the wallet no\r\n  longer corrupts spend tracking.\r\n \r\n* Database usage has been altered to avoid known data corruption issues caused\r\n  by Bolt cursors.\r\n \r\n* Wrapped address child indexes now continue to stay wrapped across wallet\r\n  restarts instead of returning to the highest returned child index.  This may\r\n  avoid unintended address reuse issues.\r\n \r\n* The first address of newly-created accounts is no longer skipped over when\r\n  generating addresses.\r\n \r\n* Handling of stake transactions has been rewritten to keep data consistent with\r\n  missed votes and blockchain reorganizations.\r\n \r\n* Ticket autobuyer was not properly starting and stopping. Now user is\r\n  properly notified when the ticket buyer has started. In the coming releases,\r\n  we will be adding even more feedback from ticket buyer so the the user\r\n  is able to see some of the decision making happening each block.\r\n\r\n* Autobuyer settings are now properly set on config updates and have confirmed\r\n  that dcrwallet receives all settings as expected configuration changes.\r\n\r\n* Under strange circumstances, users with multiple stakepools reported that\r\n  settings were being overwritten. Now, only the pool fees field is updated if\r\n  necessary.\r\n\r\n* Revocations are now shown in the transaction History page.\r\n\r\n* Small display fixes now allow clear rendering on Windows.  We are in the\r\n  process of fully releasing on Windows in the next release.\r\n \r\n* Font files were previously configured incorrectly due to not have the\r\n  corresponding font files for request font weight.  It made all fonts look\r\n  fuzzy and unclear.\r\n \r\n* Some fields have been fixed to allow expected double-click-to-select\r\n  functionality. We are auditting and trying to fix all of them soon.\r\n \r\n* Testnet2 Wallets weren't properly being located.\r\n \r\n* Update to use current network minfees by default (0.001 DCR/kB).\r\n \r\n* New account creation and account renaming are now shown immediately after\r\n  successful response from wallet.  Previously it would take an extra render\r\n  for them to be updated in the accounts list.\r\n \r\n### New features:\r\n \r\n* Transaction details page has been revamped to provide the used inputs and new\r\n  outputs that each transaction creates. We will be adding more to this page\r\n  as new information is added to be received from dcrwallet.\r\n \r\n* Transaction notifications have been moved to the bottom of the screen and\r\n  now contain a much clearer idea of each new transaction received.  We will\r\n  be adding the ability to click on these notifications to show the full\r\n  transaction details page.\r\n \r\n* Implement new seed entry system (react-select).  Now users can use the\r\n  bubble entry system to ensure they have proper spellings and length when\r\n  entering existing seed or confirming new ones.\r\n \r\n* We have started to add tooltips to various fields with the react-tooltip\r\n  package.  We are trying to avoid putting tooltips on everything.  We mostly\r\n  try to follow feedback we're getting from users as to where tooltips might\r\n  clear up confusion in terms of the UX.\r\n \r\n* Add copy-to-clipboard functionality to address generation on the Receive page.\r\n  We're currently auditing other places that it would make sense to add these\r\n  buttons (or some other trigger to copy).  Most likely, tx and block hashes,\r\n  scripts and other long strings that are annoying to highlight to copy.\r\n \r\n* Add logging with winston package.  This is the first step at revamping the\r\n  startup procedure for decrediton.  The more instances where users are can\r\n  see where something wrong, the better we can fix/diagnose further issues.\r\n \r\n* Introduce custrom animations for loading times.  Currently we have a simple\r\n  rotating DCR logo and a sprite animated Stakey.  We are planning on adding\r\n  a few more from various artists to showcase some of the great art being\r\n  created by our community.\r\n \r\n### Other improvements:\r\n \r\n* Add working wallet/account buttons to go to Accounts page for better UX.\r\n \r\n* Move stakeinfo to an expandable div on tickets page.\r\n \r\n* Overhaul of various styling according to designer input.\r\n \r\n* Refactor redux actions for cleaner reading.\r\n \r\n* Add better instructions for stakepool apikey entry.\r\n \r\n* Begin complete react component/container refactor.  This is the first step\r\n  towards fixing component structure and reuse.\r\n \r\n* Begin removing inline styles and Radium, replaced with Less styling.\r\n \r\n* Add config option to use a remote daemon set up.\r\n \r\n* Update README.md to include quirk about installing decrediton for the first\r\n  time for development.\r\n \r\n* Add core-decorators library and utilize @autobind annotation.\r\n \r\n* Update to use webpack 3.\r\n \r\n* Add rpm and deb linux builds.\r\n \r\n* Fixes to DockerFile support.\r\n \r\n### Changelog\r\n \r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/compare/v1.0.6...v1.0.7).  \r\nAlso see all changes to dcrwallet [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/compare/v1.0.5...v1.0.7)."}

All users of the GUI wallets and command line tools are encouraged to update.  Mining software is not impacted.\r\n\r\n### dcrwallet\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on fixing an issue that could result in address reuse after restarting the application.  If a previously created address was not publically used, it could be returned again after restarting.  This issue has been corrected by always deriving the next address based on the last created one.\r\n\r\nA database upgrade has been added to record the additional info needed to fix the above issue.  Due to the database being forwards-compatible only, wallet software can not be reverted to older versions after running a new version.  If a wallet must be reverted back to old software, a seed restore should be performed.\r\n\r\nTwo new RPCs have been added to this release.  The first is a revoketickets RPC for the JSON-RPC server.  This RPC models the WalletService.RevokeTickets RPC from the gRPC server and its usage is preferable to using rebroadcastmissed, which may be removed at a later time.  The second is a WalletService.GetTransaction RPC for the gRPC server.  This RPC queries the wallet for details regarding a particular transaction using the transaction hash as a lookup key.  Previously, transaction details were only available in the gRPC server by watching block notifications or querying for all transactions in a range of blocks.\r\n\r\n### Paymetheus\r\n\r\nThis release focuses on fixing an issue that could result in address reuse after restarting the application.  If a previously created address was not publically used, it could be returned again after restarting.  This issue has been corrected by always deriving the next address based on the last created one.\r\n\r\nA database upgrade has been added to record the additional info needed to fix the above issue.  Due to the database being forwards-compatible only, wallet software can not be reverted to older versions after running a new version.  If a wallet must be reverted back to old software, a seed restore should be performed.\r\n\r\n### decrediton\r\n\r\nThis patch release includes quite a few bug fixes as well as revealing more information to the user to avoid situations where the lack of information can lead to confusion.\r\n\r\nThe Accounts, Send and Receive pages have all received a large revamp to attempt to approach the designers' vision.  There are still some remaining nits to fix, but the far majority of the work has been completed.\r\n\r\nThe Accounts page now includes a balance overview for each account and that account's properties.  The Send page received the largest change, in that, it no longer has a seperate transaction confirmation view.  Instead, whenever a user completes a output or amount field they are checked for validity and then sent to dcrwallet for tx construction.  With this set up the user can now see the estimated size, fee and total amount in the lower right instead of having to wait until the next page.  Also upon clicking the Send button, the user is shown a passphrase confirmation modal.\r\n\r\nVarious other small bug fixes and visual tweaks were included in this release as well.\r\n- Revamp Accounts page to be more like the designers' wireframes. Show balances and properties below each.\r\n- Revamp Send functionality to avoid having to show a seperate confirmation page, instead immediately request the transaction to be constructed upon field update then the send button simple shows a passphrase modal to confirm.\r\n- Revamp Receive page to be more like the designers' wireframes.\r\n- Various other visual tweaks as pointed out by the designers.\r\n\r\n### dcrd\r\n\r\ndcrd changes were primarily infrastructure related (logs) or test related.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either\r\n[Paymetheus

to the\r\ndcrwallet process.  Occasionally, HTTP/2 parsing error messages would be displayed and Paymetheus\r\nwould need to be closed.  Under certain instances it was possible that the wallet would begin to work\r\nafter restarting, but some users continued to hit the issue even after restarting.  The bug was caused\r\nby an integer overflow in the grpc-go version imported by dcrwallet 1.0.3 and was fixed by upgrading\r\nthe grpc-go dependency to the latest 1.4.0 release.\r\n\r\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either\r\n[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.4/decred_1.0.4-release_x64.msi) or\r\n[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v1.0.4/decred_1.0.4-release_x86.msi)\r\ndepending on your version of Windows.\r\n\r\nSee manifest-v1.0.4.txt, and the package specific manifest files for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\r\n\r\nSee [README.md](./README.md#verifying-binaries) for more info on verifying the files.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n| Description | Pull Request |\r\n| --- | ---- |\r\n| Bump for v1.0.4 | [decred/Paymetheus#296](https://github.com/decred/Paymetheus/pull/296) |\r\n| Updates for v1.0.4 | [decred/decred-windows-installer#52](https://github.com/decred/decred-windows-installer/pull/52) |\r\n| Add other balance fields to BalanceResponse to match json/rpc | [decred/dcrwallet#801](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/801) |\r\n| Change to use immature_stake_generation instead | [decred/dcrwallet#802](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/802) |\r\n| Update all dependencies. | [decred/dcrwallet#803](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/803) |\r\n| Bump for v1.0.4 | [decred/dcrwallet#805](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/805) |\r\n\r\n## Commits\r\n\r\nThis release was built from:\r\n\r\n| Repository | Commit Hash |\r\n| --- | ---- |\r\n| decred/Paymetheus | dfb2cc73eb20464a0775e3771b287cd2d54939b7 |\r\n| decred/decred-windows-installer | db7d5b814954bcdbf2bffde7db075011a0710a25 |\r\n| decred/dcrwallet | 277226313c5b69d713e954673f12db1514e3a69a |\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n---\r\n"}

"https://api.github.com/repos/decred/decred-binaries/zipball/v0.8.0", "body": "## 2017-02-13\n\nThis release contains updates and bugfixes to all componenets of Decred.  Some noteable changes include:\n1. dcrd contains a demo of hardfork voting for use on testnet.\n2. dcrwallet has improvements to the builtin ticketbuyer.  It also has an improved getbalance command.\n3. Paymetheus contains the intial stakepool integration.\n4. decrediton now works as a self-contained app which does not require a separate download of the command line tools.  It has been updated with an entirely new visual style.  All pages have been updated or revamped so decrediton should now properly handle all basic wallet functions.\n\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either\n[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decred_0.8.0-beta_x64.msi) or\n[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decred_0.8.0-beta_x86.msi)\ndepending on your version of Windows.\n\nTo install the command line tools, please see\n[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\n\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run\n[decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decrediton-0.8.0.tar.gz) or\n[decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.8.0/decrediton-0.8.0.dmg).\n\nSee manifest-v0.8.0.txt, manifest-paymetheus-v0.8.0.txt,\nmanifest-decrediton-0.8.0.txt, and manifest-dcrinstaller-v0.8.0.txt\nfor sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\n\nSee [README.md](./README.md) for more info on\nverifying the files.\n\n## Notes\n\nAs of this release, dcrticketbuyer is no long included.  dcrwallet contains all the automatic ticketbuyer features that the standalone program used to have and should be used instead.\n\n## Changes\n\n|

"https://api.github.com/repos/decred/decred-binaries/zipball/v0.7.0", "body": "## 2016-12-26\n\nThis release contains bug fixes and improvements for dcrd, dcrwallet, and Paymetheus.\n\nThis includes the first release of decrediton, a new, cross-platform GUI for decred.  This is not a feature complete version of decrediton.  Simple operations (creating wallet, importing a seed, sending and receiving decred) are supported.  This is primarily a demo of decrediton rather than a production ready tool.  Please try it and report any issues or additional features you would like on the [github page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues).  currently binaries are only provided for 64 bit Linux and OSX.\n\nPaymetheus has added seed restoration as well as the ability to show rescan progress.\n\nA new rpc command to resync has been added to dcrwallet.  The functionality from dcrticketbuyer has been added to dcrwallet.  See [this commit](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commit/879e0689b539852315b2e311681a6b879fa77f3c) for details on using the new functionality instead of the seperate dcrticketbuyer binary.\n\ndcrd has various bugfixes and infrastructure improvements for voting in a future release.\n\ngominer and copay are unchanged so there are no new binaries for them.  You should use the previous release for either of them.\n\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either [Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x64.msi) or [Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decred_0.7.0-beta_x86.msi) depending on your version of Windows.\n\nTo install the command line tools, please see [dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\n\nTo install decrediton download, uncompress, and run [decrediton Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton_0.7.0.tar.gz) or [decrediton OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.7.0/decrediton_0.7.0.dmg).\n\nSee manifest-v0.7.0.txt, manifest-paymetheus-v0.7.0.txt, manifest-decrediton-0.7.0.txt, and manifest-dcrinstaller--v0.7.0.txt for sha256 sums and the associated .asc files to confirm those shas.\n\nSee [README.md](./README.md) for more info on verifying the files.\n\n| Description | Pull

improvements to all of the decred\ntools (dcrd, dcrwallet, gominer, Copay, and Paymetheus).  A new\nunified database for tickets and blocks has been added to dcrd.  This\nprovides significant performance and reliability improvements.\ngominer now supports NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.  gominer can now monitor\ntemperatures and fan speeds on supported AMD or NVIDIA GPUs.  The dcrd\ncodebase has been modified to track the upstream btcd project more\nclosely, allowing for easier copying of code between the two projects.\nAdditional rpc tests have been added to dcrwallet (RFP-10).  All\nchanges since the last release are listed below.\n\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either\n[Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x64.msi) or\n[Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred_0.5.0-beta_x86.msi)\ndepending on your version of Windows.\n\nTo install a the local Copay GUI download and run\n[Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.5.0.dmg)\nor\n[Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.5.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.5.0.zip).\n\nTo install the command line tools, please see\n[dcrinstaller](https://github.com/decred/decred-release/tree/master/cmd/dcrinstall).\n\nSee manifest-v0.5.0.txt, manifest-gominer-v0.5.0.txt,\nmanifest-paymetheus-v0.5.0.txt, and manifest-copay-0.5.0.txt,\nmanifest--dcrinstaller-v0.5.0.txt for sha256 sums and the associated\n.asc files to confirm those shas.\n\nSee [README.md](./README.md) for more info on\nverifying the files.\n\n| Description | Pull Request |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hook up travis | [decred/gominer#75](https://github.com/decred/gominer/pull/75) |\n| Print leading zeros in target difficulty. |

dcrwallet, gominer, and Paymetheus).  Desktop\nbinaries for Copay for OSX and Linux are included for the\nfirst time.  Paymetheus is now able to launch dcrd in the\nbackground when it runs.  This is also the first release built with\nthe version 1.7 of the go compiler.  This produces smaller and faster\nbinaries than previous versions of go.\n\nTo install Paymetheus download and run either [Paymetheus 64bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x64.msi) or [Paymetheus 32bit](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred_0.4.0-beta_x86.msi) depending on your version of Windows.\n\nTo install a the local Copay GUI download and run [Copay OSX](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-darwin-v0.4.0.dmg) or [Copay Linux](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/download/v0.4.0/decred-copay-linux-v0.4.0.zip).\n\nTo install the command line tools, please see

This is only a temporary accounting issue and will resolve itself after the tickets have been mined into a block.\n\n### dcrwallet\n- The [WalletService.SpentnessNotifications](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/blob/master/rpc/documentation/api.md#spentnessnotifications) gRPC API has been intentionally broken to avoid a deadlock situation. The RPC will appear to be working  but no responses will be streamed to the client.\n"}

Let's go over each\noption to make crystal clear its usage:\n\n#### stakepoolcoldextkey\n\nWhen this option is set it turns on stake pool functionality for\nwallet.  When stake pool is enabled for wallet, there are a series of\ntransaction checks to verify whether this wallet will vote for a\nticket that has used this stake pool's address as the ticketaddress.\n\nThis option requires the extended public key of the stake pool's cold\nwallet that will receive the pool's fees.  So on simnet for instance\nthis option looks like this:\n\n```\n--stakepoolcoldextkey=spubVWAdividNTiSM9SdLRA5JX6LYNwt58cd51TFnpnULGQ8oqNMNskfkQwU7rjWMCY7phBguVr4XTmAWyDVRKpo2dFyjFb6QG4ihB8w64UPNuu:1000\n```\n\nThe first portion (spub..., or dpub... on mainnet) is the extended\npublic key and the second (1000) is the number of addresses to\nderive. Every user of the pool gets their own cold fee wallet address\nderived, so we recommend using at least 1000 in anticipation of the\nrelative number of users in the stake pool.\n\nWhen a vote is created by the stake pool to vote on a ticket that has\nbeen given voting rights, it pays the pool fee to the address derived\nfor the cold wallet from this extended public key.\n\n#### pooladdress\n\nThis is for use by the stake pool user.  It will be an address\nprovided to the user by the stake pool.  If set, this address is used\nduring ticket purchase and will commit to a small output in the ticket\nthat gives the stake pool its required fees.\n\n#### ticketaddress\n\nSame as the old option. This is the address that the stake pool user\nis giving the ticket's voting rights to.\n\n#### poolfees\n\nThis is the required ticket fee as requested by the stake pool.  The\nvalue set by the user needs to be greater than or equal to that of the\npool.  The fee is a percentage based fee, based on the stake subsidy.\nHere is a concrete example from simnet:\n\nThe ticket price of this ticket was 46.0551008, and the ticket relay\nfees were 0.00000100 per kB. The pool fees were set to 1.00%.  The\nsubsidy on simnet at this block height is approximately 29.40888 Coins\nper vote.  This is the ticket as purchased by the user:\n\n``` javascript\n\"vin\": [\n    ... ,\n],\n\"vout\": [\n    {\n        \"value\": 46.0551008,\n        \"n\": 0,\n        \"version\": 0,\n        \"scriptPubKey\": {\n            ... ,\n            \"reqSigs\": 1,\n            \"type\": \"stakesubmission\",\n            \"addresses\": [\n                \"SsYZMHeeixdNRTkk6afzHBPL4unYDsFNd4r\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": 0,\n        \"n\": 1,\n        \"version\": 0,\n        \"scriptPubKey\": {\n            ... ,\n            \"type\": \"sstxcommitment\",\n            \"addresses\": [\n                \"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV\"\n            ],\n            \"commitamt\": 0.17948021\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        ... ,\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": 0,\n        \"n\": 3,\n        \"version\": 0,\n        \"scriptPubKey\": {\n            ... ,\n            \"type\": \"sstxcommitment\",\n            \"addresses\": [\n                \"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq\"\n            ],\n            \"commitamt\": 45.87562609\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        ... ,\n    }\n],\n```\n\nAnd here's the vote that the stake pool created for that user's\nticket:\n\n``` javascript\n\"vin\": [\n    {\n        ... ,\n    },\n    {\n        ... ,\n    }\n],\n\"vout\": [\n    {\n        ... ,\n    },\n    {\n        ... ,\n    },\n    {\n    \"value\": 0.2940888,\n    \"n\": 2,\n    \"version\": 0,\n        \"scriptPubKey\": {\n            ... ,\n            \"type\": \"stakegen\",\n            \"addresses\": [\n                \"Ssghjx8PvQVV3FM3w5FcGi9kWGvDpDkQDTV\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"value\": 75.16989347,\n        \"n\": 3,\n        \"version\": 0,\n        \"scriptPubKey\": {\n            ... ,\n            \"type\": \"stakegen\",\n            \"addresses\": [\n                \"SsYUi5tbXfqHnTPgvHcajNW4yiGeSP6n7Xq\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nAs you can see '\"n\": 2,', the third output, is the stake pool fee\nof 0.2940888.  This is 1% of the vote reward at that point\n(0.2940888/29.40888). The remaining subsidy and the original coins are\nreturned to the take pool user in output '\"n\": 3,'.
