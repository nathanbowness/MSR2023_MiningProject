Waitress is a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable
performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python
standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.7+. It
is also known to run on PyPy 3 (version 3.7 compatible python) on UNIX. It
supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.
