In modern HTML, `iframe` elements should never have children. In HTML 4 and earlier `iframe` elements were allowed to contain fallback content for legacy browsers, but it's been almost two decades since that was useful.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused `:remove_contents` to behave as if it were set to `true` when it was actually an Array.\r\n\r\n[189]:https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/pull/189\r\n"}

[#111](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/issues/111)\n  \n  The previous `:at_rules` setting still exists, and defines at-rules that may not have associated blocks, such as `@import`. If you have a custom config that contains an `:at_rules` setting, you may need to move rules can have blocks to either `:at_rules_with_properties` or `:at_rules_with_styles`.\n  \n  See Sanitize's relaxed config for an example.\n\n### Other changes\n- Added full support for CSS `@page` rules in the relaxed config, including support for all page-margin box rules (such as `@top-left`, `@bottom-center`, etc.)\n- Added the following CSS at-rules to the relaxed config:\n  - `@-moz-keyframes`\n  - `@-o-keyframes`\n  - `@-webkit-keyframes`\n  - `@document`\n- Added a whole bunch of CSS properties to the relaxed config. View the complete list [here](https://gist.github.com/rgrove/044cc7e9a5b44f583c05).\n- Small performance improvements.\n- Fixed: Upgraded Crass to 1.0.2 to pick up a fix that affected the parsing of CSS `@page` rules.\n"}

This release contains API and output changes that are incompatible with previous releases, as indicated by the major version increment.\n\n### Backwards-incompatible changes\n- HTML is now parsed using Google's Gumbo HTML5 parser, which adheres to the HTML5 parsing spec and behaves much more like modern browser parsers than the previous libxml2-based parser. As a result, HTML output may differ from that of previous versions of Sanitize.\n- All transformers now traverse the document from the top down, starting with the first node, then its first child, and so on. The `:transformers_breadth` config has been removed, and old bottom-up transformers (the previous default) may need to be rewritten.\n- Sanitize's built-in configs are now deeply frozen to prevent people from modifying them (either accidentally or maliciously). To customize a built-in config, create a new copy using `Sanitize::Config.merge()`, like so:\n\n``` ruby\nSanitize.fragment(html, Sanitize::Config.merge(Sanitize::Config::BASIC,\n  :elements        => Sanitize::Config::BASIC[:elements] + ['div', 'table'],\n  :remove_contents => true\n))\n```\n- The `clean!` and `clean_document!` methods were removed, since they weren't useful and tended to confuse people.\n- The `clean` method was renamed to `fragment` to more clearly indicate that its intended use is to sanitize an HTML fragment.\n- The `clean_document` method was renamed to `document`.\n- The `clean_node!` method was renamed to `node!`.\n- The `document` method now raises a `Sanitize::Error` if the `<html>` element isn't whitelisted, rather than a `RuntimeError`. This error is also now raised regardless of the `:remove_contents` config setting.\n- The `:output` config has been removed. Output is now always HTML, not XHTML.\n- The `:output_encoding` config has been removed. Output is now always UTF-8.\n\n### Other changes\n- Added advanced CSS sanitization support using [Crass](https://github.com/rgrove/crass), which is fully compliant with the CSS Syntax Module Level 3 parsing spec. The contents of whitelisted `<style>` elements and `style` attributes in HTML will be sanitized as CSS, or you can use the `Sanitize::CSS` class to manually sanitize CSS stylesheets or properties.\n- Added an `:allow_doctype` setting. When `true`, well-formed doctype definitions will be allowed in documents. When `false` (the default), doctype definitions will be removed from documents. Doctype definitions are never allowed in fragments, regardless of this setting.\n- Added the following elements to the relaxed config, in addition to various attributes: `article`, `aside`, `body`, `data`, `div`, `footer`, `head`, `header`, `html`, `main`, `nav`, `section`, `span`, `style`, `title`.\n- The `:whitespace_elements` config is now a Hash, and allows you to specify the text that should be inserted before and after these elements when they're removed. The old-style Array-based config value is still supported for backwards compatibility. [@alperkokmen - #94](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/pull/94/)\n- Unsuitable Unicode characters are now removed from HTML before it's parsed. [#106](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/issues/106)\n- Fixed: Non-tag brackets in input like `\"1 > 2 and 2 < 1\"` are now parsed and escaped correctly in accordance with the HTML5 spec, becoming `\"1 &gt; 2 and 2 &lt; 1\"`. [#83](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/issues/83)\n- Fixed: Siblings added after the current node during traversal are now also traversed. In previous versions they were simply skipped. [#91](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/issues/91)\n- Fixed: Nokogiri has been smacked and instructed to stop adding newlines after certain elements, because if people wanted newlines there they'd have put them there, dammit. [#103](https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/issues/103)\n- Fixed: Added a workaround for a libxml2 bug that caused an undesired content-type meta tag to be added to all documents with `<head>` elements. [Nokogiri #1008](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1008)\n"}
