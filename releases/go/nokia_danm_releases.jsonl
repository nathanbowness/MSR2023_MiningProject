With DANM 4.2 all such restrictions are things of the past, and we are confident our users will appreciate all the thought that went into creating the most seamless V6 network management experience available for Kubernetes.\r\nThese are:\r\n- DANM IPAM now supports defining allocation pools for V6 subnets as well: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/177 , https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/178\r\n- IP allocation algorithm optimized to work in constant time even with big (~4 million) addresses: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/179\r\n- V6 usage is now enabled on interfaces even when \"none\" allocation scheme is used: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/174\r\n- V4 and V6 IP routes now work independently from each other, as intended: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/205\r\n- D(uplicate)A(ddress)D(etection) is automatically disabled on DANM managed V6 interfaces to avoid unnecessarily delaying, or failing startup of V6 using Pods: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/215\r\n- ndisc_notify is set to 1 on all DANM managed V6 interfaces to automatically force neighbour update in a V6 fabric: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/222\r\n## Svcwatcher becomes production-grade\r\nSvcwatcher implements a very handy functionality, but it was always more of a showcase of what use-cases suddenly become possible with the DANM platform, rather than a utility used in production. But after the following enhancements we now confidently propose taking it into production use as well:\r\n- support added for V6 endpoints, endpoint update stability GREATLY increased: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/187\r\n- performance greatly improved by limiting processing to only the relevant API objects: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/200\r\n- svcwatcher created EndPoints are now fully compatible with latest Kubernetes DNS backends, enabling Pod name based DNS queries: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/204\r\n## CI and deployment enhancements\r\nNew features are nice, but development and operator experience are equally important! Thanks to @carstenkoester and @eMGabriel DANM made great strides in this regard as well:\r\n- build process was refactored and as a result became more convinient, and way faster: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/196\r\n- dependency management is now based on standard Go modules: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/190\r\n- DANM can now be auto-installed on existing Kubernetes environments: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/212\r\n## Some call it \"chaos testing\", we call it... testing\r\nDANM is deployed in production by various TelCo products, and as such is subject to rigorous E2E system testing processes.  Unfortunetaly Kubernetes, and the CNI architecture  in general is not entirely without shortcomings when facing node, cluster, or network outage events, but we do our best to maintain cluster state even when the unexpected happens by:\r\n-  retrying network access dependent execution paths to protect against network outages, and tying IP reservations and releases to the success of these operations: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/188\r\n- employ the fresh new error handling Informer API to protect against long-term network outages: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/207\r\n- automatically hunting for dangling resources during every CNI_ADD operation: https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/216\r\n## Dummy interfaces just become smarter\r\nOne of our recent hit feature was the creation of dummy interfaces in place of non-kernel managed DPDK devices to convey network allocations to unprivileged user space apps. However, due to the simplicity of the SR-IOV architecture users were still having trouble identifying which interface belongs to which device in complex setups, containing multiple allocations.\r\nWith the recent enhancement https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/214 DANM created dummy interfaces now convey their DPDK device's PCI ID, VLAN tag, and even their original MAC address!\r\n\r\n# DANM goes utils\r\nFrom 4.2 and onward the DANM project now consists of two repositories!\r\nNewly created danm-utils houses all the new, optional components / controllers / operators built on top of the DANM core platform, but being only loosely related to the core project. The main idea is to implement all higher-level, value adding features as optional add-ons, so you can individually decide if you would like to add their related complexity to your cluster.\r\nSo if you like DANM core, you might be interested in danm-utils too: https://github.com/nokia/danm-utils.\r\nTogether with this release we are also publicly announcing the generic availability of the first two such utilities:\r\nhttps://github.com/nokia/danm-utils/releases/tag/cleaner-v1.0\r\nIf the outage scenarios described in this release notes were hampering you in the past, make sure to check out our optional Cleaner utility!\r\n"}

(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/71)\r\n## Usability improvements\r\n* You can now configure via NetworkID which CNI config file to use when delegating to a static backend(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/63)\r\n* \"container_prefix\" now means what its name suggests, making it impossible for the user to accidentally misconfigure the name of their interfaces(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/78)\r\n* Including the infamous \"eth0\" - we know you use DANM with Kubernetes, so believe us: you need your first NIC to be always called that!\r\n* Do you want control over which interface naming scheme DANM should use, or where do the CNI config files reside? Say no more!(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/83)\r\n* Weave was not working very well together with DANM, but that's in the past (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/67)\r\n* Fixed the hard restriction that DanmNet names, and their NetworkIDs need to match, which was essentially breaking a couple of features(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/80, https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/81)\r\n## IPv6 and dual-stack improvements\r\nBrought to you by @TothFerenc!\r\n* DANM now takes care of all your IPv6 related kernel setting needs (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/69, https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/76)  \r\n* Dual-stack support is now extended to all dynamic delegates (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/74)\r\n* Unnecessary gARP replies are not sent anymore for IPv6 interfaces (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/79)\r\n* Pure IPv6 support is now extended to all dynamic delegates (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/85)\r\n\r\n# What's next - DANM 4.0.0 looming on the horizon\r\nUnless something requires hotfixing, we won't release any new DANM Version 3 content from now on.\r\nThe reason behind this decision is that we are planning to completely renew DANM network management interfaces - and hopefully blow your mind in the process!\r\nOnce this super secret awesomeness has been fully implemented, we will turn the page on DANM 3.0, and will call it \"DANM 4.0\". (Totally unrelated: we do accept marketing and branding advice from basically anyone).\r\n\r\nWant to know more? You never know, we might spoil a thing or two if you ask :)"}

This generic purpose  attribute is used to connect the logical representation of a network to a Kubernetes managed Device pool.\r\n\r\nTo showcase how the new framework can be used in a real-life use-case, we have also upgraded the dynamic-level integration of SR-IOV CNI to make a use of this attribute.\r\nVirtual Functions are managed by the __SR-IOV Device Plugin__ in the new architecture, and DANM will only take care of connecting the Pod to the network devices assigned by the Device Manager component of Kubelet.\r\nThis approach makes SR-IOV virtual functions visible to the Kubernetes scheduler, and will also enable us to make sure the CPU socket of all the Pods' compute resources are aligned - once Topology Manager feature hits Kubernetes main branch (1.14, fingers crossed).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the project's README, or check-out our new example manifests!\r\n\r\nImportant disclaimer: backward compatibility to older versions of the SR-IOV CNI project is not maintained. DANM only supports the dynamic-level integration to the latest and greatest version from both the CNI, and the Device Plugin component."}

(https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/5)\r\n* RBAC support (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/29)\r\n* Possibility to use in-cluster configuration with all our components (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/6)\r\n* IP routes and Policy-based IP routes can now be provisioned regardless of NetworkType (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/13)\r\n* MACVLAN joins the list of 100% DanmNet API managed CNI plugins!\r\n* we got rid of our nasty Docker dependency, DANM now works with all container runtimes (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/26)\r\n* An API-driven hybrid interface naming scheme was introduced to give complete control in the hands of netadmins over how they want their container interfaces to be named (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/27)\r\n* DANM now supports namespace-wide default networks (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/34), if you hate micromanaging your network connections\r\n* Looking out for RedHat folks by adding buildah and prodman support to our automated build system (https://github.com/nokia/danm/pull/38)\r\n\r\n# What's next\r\nWe have loads of exciting ideas already in our pipelines! But, of course we are constantly on the lookout for further suggestions :)\r\nBut to give you a sneak-peak into out current activities, our short-term focus is on providing better support for IPv6 both with documentation and functionality, creating automated cluster-upgrade playbooks for zero effort DANM integration, integrating SR-IOV device plugin, and making the services of our special IPAM plugin usable in all kinds of environments!"}
