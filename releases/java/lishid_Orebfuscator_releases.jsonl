When updating, always check https://github.com/lishid/Orebfuscator/wiki/Configuration-File for more latest details.\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nSponsored by the dev team from DevotedMC, we are proud to offer a release of Orebfuscator compatible with CraftBukkit/Spigot for Minecraft version 1.9 through 1.13.2. Note: Some early builds of Spigot 1.13.2 may not be compatible.\r\n\r\nNote: This release requires [ProtocolLib 4.0.2 build 293 or later](http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/293/) to work with 1.10/1.11,  [4.3.0 or newer](http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/) for 1.12, and now [4.4.0 or newer](http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/) for 1.13.x.\r\n\r\n**This release has no compatibility with unlisted versions of Minecraft, it will only work with version 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, 1.12, 1.13.1/2 of CraftBukkit compatible servers**. For 1.8, use Orebfuscator 3.0.6 (see releases for pre-builds).\r\n\r\nThis was compiled using Java 8.\r\n\r\n**Warning** Not every possible configuration has been tested at scale, and issues may remain. Please, please, open a [new issue](https://github.com/lishid/Orebfuscator/issues/new) with as many details as you can provide if you encounter a problem.\r\n\r\n**WARNING FOR PAPER SERVERS** In testing, I discovered that Paper's Asynchronous chunkloader is incompatible with this latest version of Orebfuscator. Please modify paper.yml and set async-chunk:enabled:false in that file, and restart Paper. I will investigate to see if its possible to overcome this incompatibility, but at present it will 100% always cause lockups and failures.\r\n\r\n### New Features / Fixes\r\n\r\n- Continued support for 1.13, 1.13.1, and 1.13.2 of CraftBukkit\r\n\r\n- Improved understanding of Paper compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The 4.3.3 Gaze proximity hiding _may_ introduce some additional lag. If it does, you can simply turn it off, however, please forward timings to us so we can improve it. For our use case it seemed to _improve_ performance, and also makes it significantly harder for x-ray users to find chests and other proximity hid items.\r\n\r\nNo scheduled future release; next release will be a roundup of any bugs found and fixed.\r\n\r\n### Unknowns\r\n\r\nIf you run a larger server (100+ players), we'd be especially grateful if you could share your timings report with us.\r\n\r\nPlease also let us know if backwards compatibility is broken in this release. Not all prior versions have been tested."}

When updating, always check https://github.com/lishid/Orebfuscator/wiki/Configuration-File for more latest details.\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nSponsored by DevotedMC @ play.devotedmc.com (Join us!) we are proud to offer a release of Orebfuscator compatible with CraftBukkit/Spigot for Minecraft version 1.9 through 1.12.\r\n\r\nNote: This release requires [ProtocolLib 4.0.2 build 293 or later](http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/293/) to work with 1.10/1.11, and you must be using [4.3.0 or newer](http://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/) for 1.12.\r\n\r\n**This release has no compatibility with unlisted versions of Minecraft, it will only work with version 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, 1.12 of CraftBukkit compatible servers**. For 1.8, use Orebfuscator 3.0.6 (see releases for pre-builds).\r\n\r\nThis was compiled using Java 8.\r\n\r\n**Warning** Not every possible configuration has been tested at scale, and issues may remain. Please, please, open a [new issue](https://github.com/lishid/Orebfuscator/issues/new) with as many details as you can provide if you encounter a problem.\r\n\r\n### New Features / Fixes\r\n- Includes fixes for portions of #164 \r\n- NEW FEATURE: Gaze based proximity hiding. If you can't see it due to blocks in the way, it stays proximity hid, regardless of your physical closeness! For full details, read here: https://github.com/DevotedMC/Orebfuscator/pull/16\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The new Gaze proximity hiding _may_ introduce some additional lag. If it does, you can simply turn it off, however, please forward timings to us so we can improve it. For our use case it seemed to _improve_ performance, and also makes it significantly harder for x-ray users to find chests and other proximity hid items.\r\n\r\nNo scheduled future release; next release will be a roundup of any bugs found and fixed.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to test the various engine modes and configurations, but we covet your input as well.\r\n\r\n### Unknowns\r\n\r\nGood news! We've had some \"at-scale\" with over 100 people online simultaneously. I'm pleased to report that after fixing some performance issues in 4.1.10, Orebfuscator consumes less then 0.05% of tick time with 100+ players on a fairly modest server machine. You cannot beat that kind of performance, with this feature set, at that kind of load. \r\n\r\nThat said, if you run a larger server (100+ players), we'd be especially grateful if you could share your timings report with us."}

For 1.8, use Orebfuscator 3.0.6 (see releases for pre-builds).\n\nThis was compiled using Java 7.\n\n**Warning** This is an Alpha release. Not everything has been tested at scale, and issues may remain. Please, please, open a [new issue](https://github.com/DevotedMC/Orebfuscator/issues/new) with as many details as you can provide if you encounter a problem.\n\n### New Features / Fixes\n- Fixed crash when chunk section (16 x 16 x 16) has more than 127 different block types\n- Implemented different \"transparent block\" lists for Engine Mode 1 and Engine Mode 2. For now only difference is with lava block, for mode 1 it is non-transparent, for mode 2 it is transparent.\n- Implemented possibility to specify which blocks are transparent and not in the config file, sections: TransparentBlocks and NonTransparentBlocks.\n- Fix which may have solved java.util.ConcurrentModificationException\n- Fix for phantom blocks (visible after chunk reloaded) when player is digging straight line on the chunk border. Details:\n  It was happening because the player is not changing neighbor chunks (and therefore its hash code stayed the same) while mining, but since border blocks from another chunk might have been changed to air then some border blocks from \"unchanged chunk\" must be deobfuscated, but cache prevented this. Fix involved invalidating these \"neighbor\" caches.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nMany internals were changed to address the java.util.ConcurrentModificationException reports; we cannot guarantee it is fixed, but we strongly believe the situation should be improved. We covet reports of either success or failure.\n\nNext scheduled release will be May 8th, unless a critical bug is found and fixed.\n\nWe will continue to test the various engine modes and configurations, but we covet your input as well.\n\n### Unknowns\n\nWe do no yet have a ton of at-scale performance metrics. If you run a large server, we'd be especially grateful if you could share your timings report with us. In our smaller scale tests (around a dozen players) there did not seem to be any performance impact.\n"}
