Please refer to the [installation guide](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n-   Thanks to lots of work within [*argon2-cffi-bindings*], there're pre-compiled wheels for many new platforms. Including:\r\n\r\n    -   Apple Silicon via `universal2`\r\n    -   Linux on `amd64` and `arm64`\r\n    -   [*musl libc*](https://musl.libc.org) ([*Alpine* Linux!](https://www.alpinelinux.org)) on `i686`, `amd64`, and `arm64`\r\n    -   PyPy 3.8\r\n\r\n    We hope to provide wheels for Windows on `arm64` soon, but are waiting for GitHub Actions to support that.\r\n\r\n-   `argon2.Parameters.from_parameters()` together with the `argon2.profiles` module that offers easy access to the RFC-recommended configuration parameters and then some. [#101](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/101) [#110](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/110)\r\n\r\n-   The CLI interface now has a `--profile` option that takes any name from `argon2.profiles`.\r\n\r\n-   Types! *argon2-cffi* is now fully typed. [#112](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/112)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n-   `argon2.PasswordHasher` now uses the RFC 9106 low-memory profile by default. The old defaults are available as `argon2.profiles.PRE_21_2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*argon2-cffi-bindings*]: https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hynek/argon2-cffi/releases/54864968/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
