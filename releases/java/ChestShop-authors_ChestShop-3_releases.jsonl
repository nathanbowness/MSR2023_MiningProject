If you want to see your language or have improvements please help out on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/chestshop-3)! *Swedish*, *Norwegian*, *Italian*, *Korean*, *Japanese* and *Simplified Chinese* only need a couple more translations to be 100%!\r\nIf you are still using the legacy `local.yml` then now is the time to switch to the new system! \r\n- Added item name aliasing via the `itemAliases.yml`\r\n- Added the ability to display a shop's stock on the sign by enabling the `USE_STOCK_COUNTER` config option. (#368)\r\n- Added a `/shopinfo` command which shows some information about the shop that is looked at. (#203) The same information will show up when a player tries to open a shop container they don't have access to! (`ChestShop.shopinfo` permission)\r\n- Move to use the adventure-text library for components. This fixes client disconnect issues with hover message (#353) as well as re-add support for pure CraftBukkit servers.\r\n- `TURN_OFF_DEFAULT_PROTECTION_WHEN_PROTECTED_EXTERNALLY` now also supports BlockLocker, Deadbolt, Lockette(Pro), Residence and SimpleChestLock and not just LWC (#445)\r\n- Added [config options](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Acrobot/ChestShop/Configuration/Properties.java#L197-L203) which allow disabling some playername/uuid checks to allow the user with Geyser/Floodgate. (#383)\r\n- Made admin shops that have shop containers use items from that instead of being unlimited. (Admin shops without containers will still be unlimited) If you want admin shops to be unlimited even with a container then set `FORCE_UNLIMITED_ADMIN_SHOP` to true. (#402)\r\n- Added more [metrics](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/ChestShop/1109#versionMcSelf) to allow for correct judgement when to upgrade to certain server or Java versions.\r\n\r\n**For Developers:**\r\n- The `/shopinfo` command and right click will (additionally to the `ItemInfoEvent` to show item information) call the new [`ShopInfoEvent`](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Acrobot/ChestShop/Events/ShopInfoEvent.java) with which you can add additional information about the shop to the output.\r\n- The `ProtectionCheckEvent` now has a new boolean field `checkManagement` which specifies whether or not the event is a management check or a simple access check. This is necessary as some external plugins like LWC have different admin and access rights for members. The original event didn't differentiate that which lead to people only having access permissions being able to remove shops.\r\n- Removed deprecated methods from `PreTransactionEvent` (`getOwner` and `setOwner(OfflinePlayer)`) as well as from `NameManager` (`getLastAccountFromShortName(String)`, `getUUID(String)`, `getUsername(UUID)`, `getFullUsername(String)`,  `getShortUsername(String)`, `canUseName(Player, String)`).

([1.12.2](https://ci.minebench.de/job/ChestShop-3-1.12/) and [1.8.8](https://ci.minebench.de/job/ChestShop-3-1.8.8/) builds have been patched too!)\r\n\r\n*This update would've taken ~300\u20ac to develop. Learn how to support Phoenix616 [**here**](https://tip.phoenix616.dev).*\r\n\r\nPlease read all the notes and changes before upgrading!\r\n\r\nGoing forward ChestShop will now require **Spigot or any other server providing the spigot-api** with bungee-chat in order to support component messages! If you need pure Bukkit support use [this build](https://ci.minebench.de/job/ChestShop-3/208/).\r\n\r\nPlease note that each server update might require a conversion of the items database to ensure that all item data is compatible with the server version you are running. **Downgrading the server or plugin is not advised and will most likely lead to errors!** Always restore from a backup!\r\n\r\n**This update brings a new language system** which will support multiple different language files in the future. To help with the translation please use [this page](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/chestshop/localization).\r\nThe legacy `local.yml` will still work if you set your default language in the config to `legacy` in the config.yml but I highly suggest you transfer your settings into the new files in the languages folder in order to get access to all new messages!\r\n\r\n#### Notable Changes:\r\n- **Fix issues that could've lead to the server crashing with certain shop setups**\r\n- Added a multi-language system which can select different language files based on the client language! (Can be toggled with `USE_CLIENT_LOCALE`) The default l anguage can be set with `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`.\r\n- Added support for hover/click messages and easy 1.16 rgb coloring using the [MineDown syntax](https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown#syntax)\r\n- Added `/csmetrics` command to view shop accounts and average transactions. These and some more statistic will also be included in bStats in the future (when the site supports more chart types)\r\n- Improve `/iteminfo` command to include more info about the item (lore, book author/pages/generation and item repair cost). Also made these messages configurable in the language files.\r\n- Added maximum shop amount setting. Defaults to a full double chest.\r\n- Added config option to limit trading on shops based on external sign protections like LWC (`CHECK_ACCESS_FOR_SHOP_USE`)\r\n- Added ability to reload discount and restrictions configs (#252)\r\n- Added config option to sell/buy all items with shift instead of just stacks: `SHIFT_SELLS_EVERYTHING` (#320)\r\n- Made 0 a legal price for `free`\r\n- Added  config option to block shop creation when LWC limits are reached (`LWC_LIMITS_BLOCK_CREATION`)\r\n- Disabled the auto-updater on new installations. Automatic download and install should only be done when the user actively chooses to do so.\r\n- Added notifications about new development builds (will only send a message to the log once per build). Can be disabled/configured in `jenkinsBuildsNotifier.yml`\r\n- Fixed an issue with the permissions regarding autofilling shop signs (#325)\r\n- Fixed an issue that put the wrong sign into the chest on auto remove (#313)\r\n\r\n#### Notes for developers:\r\n- `com.Acrobot.ChestShop.Configuration.Messages` no longer contains string constants but `Message` objects in order to support components\r\n- It is now possible to implement bank/group/team/clan/multi-account shop support. In order to do that you will need to implement all of the economy events like the [VaultListener](https://github.com/ChestShop-authors/ChestShop-3/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Acrobot/ChestShop/Listeners/Economy/Plugins/VaultListener.java) does as well as handle the PreShopCreationEvent, AccountQueryEvent and AccountAccessEvent in order to return your own Accounts/UUIDs for your groups. (An example implementation will follow in the future)"}
