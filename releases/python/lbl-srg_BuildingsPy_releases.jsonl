To install the latest version, run `pip` as described at http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/buildingspy/install.html\n\nThe following changes have been done:\n- Added module fmi with a function that outputs fmu dependencies.\n- Added regression tests for OpenModelica.\n- Changed implementation of addParameters(...) to allow\n  setting values of parameters that are arrays.\n- Corrected bug that lead to files such as .DStore in Resources/Scripts\n  to be processed as if they were scripts that run unit tests.\n- Added class buildingspy.development.merger, which can be used\n  to merge the Annex60 Modelica library to other Modelica libraries,\n  such as the Buildings library.\n- Corrected bug in copying the files for the unit tests, which\n  caused libpython2.7.so not to be copied on some computers\n- Added method development.include_fmu_tests that allow testing\n  the export of FMUs.\n- development.regressiontest now also reports when Dymola\n  had to select default initial conditions,\n  a model had redundant consistent initial conditions, or\n  a model had type inconsistent definition equations.\n- Corrected bug in simulate.Simulator that caused a syntax error\n  in the Modelica .mos script when setting boolean variables.\n- Changed the API of buildingspy.simulate.Simulator.\n  Previously, the MODELICAPATH was used as the default\n  to load the package.mo file. This was changed because the\n  MODELICAPATH variable points one directory higher than the\n  location of the package.mo file.\n  Now, the current directory is used as the default value, which\n  can be overwritten using the parameter packagePath.\n- Corrected bug in buildingspy.development.regressiontest that\n  only used the first word in the result mat file. This bug\n  caused the unit tests to return with an error if for example\n  an output file was named Obsolete.FlowMachine\n- Corrected bug in buildingspy.development.Validator that\n  caused the html section to be not validated if the Modelica\n  file contained the </html> and <html> element on the same line.\n- Added new module buildingspy.development.refactor that provides\n  functions to refactor Modelica libraries.\n- Corrected forward and backward slashes in module that runs\n  the regression tests.\n- Added new function buildingspy.io.outputfile.get_model_statistics,\n  which allows obtaining the statistics of the model, such as the\n  number of nonlinear equations.\n- Added in buildingspy.development.regressiontest.Tester() the\n  new function writeOpenModelicaResultDictionary() that writes\n  a result dictionary for the OpenModelica regression tests.\n- Added regression tests for FMU export for Dymola.\n- In regression tests, added a check for parameters that only have\n  a start value assigned.\n- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added functionality\n  to save Output, InitialUnknown and Derivatives dependency on\n  inputs to the reference results.\n- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added option to\n  use pedantic Modelica check.\n- Improved regression tests so that the list of plot variables\n  no longer needed to be on a single line. This was done\n  as later versions of Dymola do not write line breaks when\n  exporting the .mos script.\n- Added option to simulate a Modelica model without recompilation.\n- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added tests for\n  differentiation of if-expressions,\n  invalid connect statements,\n  redeclaration of non-replaceable classes,\n  failure to interpret experiment annotation,\n  file not found, and\n  missing .mos script.\n- Corrected html check if the html is on a single line.\n- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, changed reading of\n  dslog.txt to be line by line as opposed to the whole file at once.\n  The reason is that reading the whole file can give an \"out of memory for strings\"\n  error for very long files as the size of Stringbuffer in\n  dymola/source/matrixop.h is not dynamically allocated.\n"}
