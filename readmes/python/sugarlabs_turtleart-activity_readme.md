TurtleBlocks
============

Turtle Art, also known as Turtle Blocks, is an activity with a
Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on
snap-together visual programming elements. Its "low floor" provides an
easy entry point for beginners. It also has "high ceiling"
programming, graphics, mathematics, and Computer Science features
which will challenge the more adventurous student.

.. note ::

   There are two inter-compatible programs: Turtle Art and Turtle Blocks. Turtle Art, which closely parallels the Java version of Turtle Art maintained by Brian Silverman, offers a small subset of the functionality of Turtle Blocks. Turtle Blocks is the version included in the Sugar distribution. Sugar users probably want to use Turtle Blocks rather than Turtle Art. (Also see Turtle Confusion, a collection of programming challenges designed by Barry Newell.)

Using Turtle Art
----------------

Start by clicking on (or dragging) blocks from the Turtle palette. Use
multiple blocks to create drawings; as the turtle moves under your
control, colorful lines are drawn.

You add blocks to your program by clicking on or dragging them from
the palette to the main area. You can delete a block by dragging it
back onto the palette. Click anywhere on a "stack" of blocks to start
executing that stack or by clicking in the Rabbit (fast) or Turtle
(slow) on the Main Toolbar.
