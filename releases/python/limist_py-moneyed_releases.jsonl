This used to result in an object with a made-up `\"XYZ\"` currency, which could lead to surprising behaviors and bugs.\r\n* Added `zero` property to `Currency` to conveniently access the zero value of a given currency.\r\n* Moved to use setuptool's declarative packaging config and PEP 517 isolated builds.\r\n* Removed requirements files and instead specified test requirements using extras."}
