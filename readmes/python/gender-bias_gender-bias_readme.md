# Reading for  Bias

We are updating our language because we are now working to include bias related to race and ethnicity. Some of the code/commands as well as the project title will still reflect the original project which focused on gender bias. The goal is to continue to update this tool as new ways of identifying ALL forms of bias are recognized.

***Promote equity by identifying potential bias in letters of recommendation and evaluations***

***Autocorrect for bias***

Implicit bias in evaluations negatively affects individuals at every stage of their career. The goal of this project is to create a web-based text analysis tool that scans and reveals language bias associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation.  The tool will provide a summary of potential changes to the writer to help them remove bias.  The hope is that by bringing awareness to the existence of implicit bias, we can change how evaluations and letters are drafted and judged, thereby providing a concrete way to tackle disparities related to gender, race, and ethnicity.

## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the Reading for Bias project!

This document (the README file) introduces you to the project.  Feel free to explore by section or just scroll through.

## What is the project about?

### The problem

* Disparities based on gender, race, and ethnicity exist in medicine, science, business, and many other professions
* Letters of recommendation and evaluations written differ in key ways depending on gender, race, and ethnicity
* The differences impact everything from how individuals are graded in a class to whether they are hired or promoted
* Most writers are unaware of bias in their writing (it is implicit)

So, even if someone wants to write a really strong letter, they will probably include language that reflects [implicit bias][link_implicitbias], which weakens the letter.

### The solution

Reading for Bias is a web-based text analysis tool that:

* Scans evaluations or letters for language associated with bias
* Summarizes changes that would reduce bias for the writer
* Increases awareness of bias related to gender, race, and ethnicity

## Usage

This document is currently a work-in-progress; please feel free to ask for clarification in the Issues tab of this repository, or on our slack workspace (details below).

### Installation

Currently, the most reliable way to download and start using this code is to clone it from this repository and install it using pip:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gender-bias/gender-bias
cd gender-bias
pip3 install -e .
```

> **NOTE**: The last line in the above snippet installs this library in "editable" mode, which is probably fine while the library is in a state of flux.

This installation process will add a new command-line tool to your PATH, called `genderbias`.

To install the dependencies, run:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

#### Learning about usage

```shell
genderbias -h

usage: genderbias [-h] [--file FILE] [--json] [--list-detectors]
                  [--detectors DETECTORS]

CLI for gender-bias detection

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file FILE, -f FILE  The file to check
  --json, -j            Enable JSON output, instead of text
  --list-detectors      List the available detectors
  --detectors DETECTORS
                        Use specific detectors, not all available
```

You can probably ignore most of these options when getting started.

#### Checking a document

There are two ways to check a document: 

##### Option 1: Standard-In

This option streams a file from stdin and writes its suggestions to stdout. You can use it like this:

```shell
cat my-file.txt | genderbias
```

If you don't have a text file handy, you can try it out on one of ours:

```shell
cat ./example_letters/letterofRecW | genderbias
```

The tool will print its suggestions out to stdout:

```
Effort vs Accomplishment
 [516-527]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'willingness' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 [2915-2926]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'willingness' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 [3338-3347]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'dedicated' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 [3492-3502]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'commitment' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 [3524-3533]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'tenacious' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 [3706-3716]: Effort vs Accomplishment: The word 'commitment' tends to speak about effort more than accomplishment. (Try replacing with phrasing that emphasizes accomplishment.)
 SUMMARY: This document has a high ratio (6:1) of words suggesting effort to words suggesting concrete accomplishment.
 ```
 
If you'd rather that the tool print its suggestions to another file, you can use the following:

```shell
cat ./example_letters/letterofRecW | genderbias > edits-to-made.txt
```

##### Option 2: Specify a file with a flag

This functionality is EXACTLY the same; just a matter of how you prefer to run the tool!

```shell
genderbias -f ./example_letters/letterofRecW
```

The `-f` or `--file` flag can be used to specify a file.

### How to interpret output

The output of this tool is a _character-index span_ that you can think of as "highlighting" the problematic (or potentially-problematic) text. Our intention is to add a more human-readable form as well; **if you're interested in helping develop that capability, please get in touch!**

### Using the tool as a REST server

The tool can also be run as a REST server in order to operate on text sent from a front-end â€” for example, [our client-side website](https://github.com/gender-bias/reading-for-genderbias-web). To run the server, run the following:

```shell
genderbias-server
```

This will start a Flask server listening on port 5000.

To use this server, send a POST requests to the `/check` endpoint, with a JSON body of the following form:

```json
{
    "text": "My text goes here"
}
```

For example, in Python, using `requests`:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/check", 
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}, 
    json={"text": "this is my text"}
)

print(response.json())
```

The response is JSON of the form:

```json
{
    "issues": List[genderbias.Issue],
    "text": <the same text you sent, for reference>
}
```



## About the founder

[Mollie][link_Mollie] is a medical student and neuroscientist who would like to make the world a better place.

The development of this project is mentored by [Jason][link_Jason] as part of [Mozilla Open Leaders][link_mozilla] and started in 2018.

## How can you get involved?

So glad you asked!  WooHoo!

Help in any way you can!

We need expertise in coding, web design, program development, documentation, and technical writing.  We're using Python for the text analysis. I've created issues around different rules/signals to search for in letters.  Example letters can be found [here](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/tree/master/example_letters).

If you think you can help in any of these areas or in an area I haven't thought of yet, please check out our [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [roadmap](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/issues/1).

The goal of this project is to promote equity, so we want to maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate.  Please follow the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) in all interactions on and offline.  Thanks!

* More likely to highlight [effort](#effort) ('They are hard-working') instead of highlighting accomplishments ('their research')
* More likely to discuss [personal life](#personal-life) and fail to use formal titles
* More likely to include [stereotypes](#stereotypes) ('They are warm' while 'They are a skilled') and emotion-focused words
* More likely to [raise doubt](#raise-doubt)
