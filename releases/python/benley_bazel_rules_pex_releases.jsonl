The implementation is considerably simpler now, and this should improve cross-compatibility with the the built-in bazel py_binary/py_library/py_test rules.\n- Switched to JSON instead of a bespoke textual manifest format to pass data from skylark to pex_wrapper at build time.\n- pex_pytest now marks its test runner script as `testonly` so bazel will allow dependencies on other `testonly` rules.\n"}
