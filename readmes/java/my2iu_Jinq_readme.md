# [JINQ: Easy Database Queries for Java 8](http://www.jinq.org)

Jinq provides developers an easy and natural way to write database queries in Java. You can treat database data like normal Java objects stored in collections. You can iterate over them and filter them using normal Java commands, and all your code will be automatically translated into optimized database queries. Finally, LINQ-style queries are available for Java!

Jinq can also be used within Scala to provide database queries similar to [Typesafe's Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) but using JPA ORMs like Hibernate.

Documentation about how to get started with Jinq and other information can be found on the [Jinq project page](http://www.jinq.org)
