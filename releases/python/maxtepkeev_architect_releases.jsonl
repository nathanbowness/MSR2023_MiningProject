All functionality is now provided by an `architect.install` decorator which dynamically injects requested feature, e.g. partition, into a model under the `architect` namespace, e.g. `model.architect.partition`. No more mixins, inheritance and nested classes with settings that pollute model's namespace. More information is available in the [docs](http://architect.readthedocs.org/features/index.html)\n- Added: New `operation` feature which provide an abstraction layer to execute raw SQL statements which will work with any supported ORM, see [docs](http://architect.readthedocs.org/features/operation.html)\n- Fixed: Issue #8 (`cannot import name string_literal` error with PonyORM and PyMySQL if `pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()` was used)\n- Fixed: Issue #7 (SQLite dummy backend was completely broken)\n- Fixed: Issue #4 (`autocommit cannot be used inside a transaction` error with Django if a model was used inside `with transaction.atomic()` block)\n- Fixed: Issue #2 (`partition` command was unable to find module with models to partition)\n- Fixed: Issue #1 (`relation already exists` error when trying to insert data into non-existent partition simultaneously from several queries) (thanks to [Daniel Kontsek](https://github.com/dn0))\n"}
