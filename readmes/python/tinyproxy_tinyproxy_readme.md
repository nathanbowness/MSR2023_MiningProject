# Tinyproxy

Tinyproxy is a small, efficient HTTP/SSL proxy daemon released under the
GNU General Public License.  Tinyproxy is very useful in a small network
setting, where a larger proxy would either be too resource intensive, or
a security risk.  One of the key features of Tinyproxy is the buffering
connection concept.  In effect, Tinyproxy will buffer a high speed
response from a server, and then relay it to a client at the highest
speed the client will accept.  This feature greatly reduces the problems
with sluggishness on the Internet.  If you are sharing an Internet
connection with a small network, and you only want to allow HTTP
requests to be allowed, then Tinyproxy is a great tool for the network
administrator.

## Installation

Tinyproxy uses a standard GNU `configure` script based on the automake
system.  If compiling from a git checkout, you need to first run

```
./autogen.sh
```

from the top level directory to generate the `configure` script.
The release tarball contains the pre-created `configure` script,
so when building from a release, you can skip this step.
Then basically all you need to do is


```
./configure
make
make install
```

in the top level directory to compile and install Tinyproxy. There are
additional command line arguments you can supply to `configure`. They
include:

- `--enable-debug`: 
If you would like to turn on full debugging support.

- `--enable-xtinyproxy`: 
Compile in support for the XTinyproxy header, which is sent to any
web server in your domain.

- `--enable-filter`: 
Allows Tinyproxy to filter out certain domains and URLs.

- `--enable-upstream`: 
Enable support for proxying connections through another proxy server.

- `--enable-transparent`: 
Allow Tinyproxy to be used as a transparent proxy daemon.
Unlike other work modes, transparent proxying doesn't require explicit
configuration and works automatically when traffic is redirected to
the proxy using the appropriate firewall rules.

- `--enable-reverse`: 
Enable reverse proxying.

- `--with-stathost=HOST`: 
Set the default name of the stats host.

For more information about the build system, read the INSTALL file
that is generated by `autogen.sh` and comes with the release tar ball.
