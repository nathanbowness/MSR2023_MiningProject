MUSIC provides mechanisms to transfer massive amounts of event information and continuous values from one parallel application to another.  Special care has been taken to ensure that existing neuronal network simulators can be adapted to MUSIC.  In particular, MUSIC handles data transfer between applications that use different time steps and different data allocation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis is the MUSIC pilot implementation.\r\n\r\nMUSIC 1.1.17 provides full support for Python3 and updates and bug-fixes to the mechanisms for configuring a MUSIC co-simulation from Python."}
