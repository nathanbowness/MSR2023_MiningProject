<hr/>

A complete and mature WebAssembly runtime for Go based on
[Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer).

Features

  * **Easy to use**: The `wasmer` API mimics the standard WebAssembly API,
  * **Fast**: `wasmer` executes the WebAssembly modules as fast as
    possible, close to **native speed**,
  * **Safe**: All calls to WebAssembly will be fast, but more
    importantly, completely safe and sandboxed.
    
**Documentation**: [browse the detailed API
documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer)
full of examples.

**Examples** as tutorials: [browse the `examples/`
directory](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/tree/master/examples),
it's the best place for a complete introduction!

# Install

To install the library, follow the classical:

```sh
$ go get github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer
```

And you're ready to get fun!

## Supported platforms

This library embeds the Wasmer runtime compiled as shared library
objects, and so uses [`cgo`](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) to consume
it. A set of precompiled shared library objects are provided. Thus
this library works (and is tested) on the following platforms:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>Architecture</th>
      <th>Triple</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Linux</td>
      <td><code>amd64</code></td>
      <td><code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code></td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>aarch64</code></td>
      <td><code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code></td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Darwin</td>
      <td><code>amd64</code></td>
      <td><code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code></td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>aarch64</code></td>
      <td><code>aarch64-apple-darwin</code></td>
      <td>⏳</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Windows</td>
      <td><code>amd64</code></td>
      <td><code>x86_64-pc-windows-msvc</code></td>
      <td>⏳</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

  <summary>What to do if your platform is missing?</summary>
  
  Up to now, there is no script to automate that process. [We are
  working on it](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/issues/191).

  Here are the steps to do that manually:
  
  ```sh
  $ # Build the new Wasmer C API shared object library.
  $ cargo build --release
  $
  $ # Configure cgo.
  $ export CGO_CFLAGS="-I$(pwd)/wasmer/packaged/include/"
  $ export CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$(pwd)/target/release/ -L$(pwd)/target/release/ -lwasmer_go"
  $
  $ # Run the tests.
  $ just test -tags custom_wasmer_runtime
  ```
</details>

# Examples

We highly recommend to read the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/tree/master/examples)
directory, which contains a sequence of examples/tutorials. It's the
best place to learn by reading examples.

But for the most eager of you, there is a quick toy program in
`examples/appendices/simple.go`, written in Rust:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

A compiled WebAssembly binary is included in
[`examples/appendices/simple.wasm`]((https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/blob/master/examples/appendices/simple.wasm)).

Then, we can execute it in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	wasmer "github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go/wasmer"
)

func main() {
    wasmBytes, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("simple.wasm")

    engine := wasmer.NewEngine()
    store := wasmer.NewStore(engine)

    // Compiles the module
    module, _ := wasmer.NewModule(store, wasmBytes)

    // Instantiates the module
    importObject := wasmer.NewImportObject()
    instance, _ := wasmer.NewInstance(module, importObject)

    // Gets the `sum` exported function from the WebAssembly instance.
    sum, _ := instance.Exports.GetFunction("sum")

    // Calls that exported function with Go standard values. The WebAssembly
    // types are inferred and values are casted automatically.
    result, _ := sum(5, 37)

    fmt.Println(result) // 42!
}
```

And then, finally, enjoy by running:

```sh
$ cd examples/appendices/
$ go run simple.go
42
```

# Testing

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
$ just test
```

# What is WebAssembly?

Quoting [the WebAssembly site](https://webassembly.org/):

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a
> stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target
> for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling
> deployment on the web for client and server applications.

About speed:

> WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of
> [common hardware
> capabilities](https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/#assumptions-for-efficient-execution)
> available on a wide range of platforms.

About safety:

> WebAssembly describes a memory-safe, sandboxed [execution
> environment](https://webassembly.org/docs/semantics/#linear-memory) […].

# FAQ

## How to run Go programs compiled to WebAssembly modules with `wasmer-go`?

Let's start by emphasing that `wasmer-go` is a WebAssembly runtime. It
allows to _run_ WebAssembly inside Go. It's not a tool to _compile_ a
Go program into WebAssembly. Nonetheless, many people are reporting
issues when compiling Go programs to WebAssembly, and then trying to
run them with `wasmer-go` (or in another hosts, like
[Python](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python),
[C](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/tree/master/lib/c-api),
[PHP](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-php),
[Ruby](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-ruby),
[Rust](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)…).

The major problem is that, whilst the Go compiler supports
WebAssembly, [it does not support
WASI](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31105) (WebAssembly System
Interface). It generates an ABI that is deeply tied to JavaScript, and
one needs to use the `wasm_exec.js` file provided by the Go toolchain,
which doesn't work outside a JavaScript host.

Fortunately, there are two solutions to this problem:

1. Use [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org) to compile your Go program to
   WebAssembly with the `-target wasi` option, e.g.:
   
   ```sh
   $ tinygo build -o module.wasm -target wasi .
   ```
   
   The generated WebAssembly module will be portable across all
   WebAssembly runtimes that support WASI.

2. Use the Go compiler with adapters. Let's see how to compile:

   ```sh
   $ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o module.wasm .
   ```
   
   (the `GOOS=js` is the sign that JavaScript is targeted, not a surprise).
   
   Then pick one adapter (they are written by the community):
   
   * [`mattn/gowasmer`](https://github.com/mattn/gowasmer/),
   * [`go-wasm-adapter/go-wasm`](https://github.com/go-wasm-adapter/go-wasm/),

   and follow their documentation.

We highly recommend the first solution (with TinyGo) if it works for
you as the WebAssembly module will be portable across all WebAssembly
runtimes. It's not a hacky solution based on adapters; it's the right
way to… go.
