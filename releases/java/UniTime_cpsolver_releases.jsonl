(13-Apr-2022 3:17 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Sectioning: Student Scheduling Preferences\r\n- added ability to define the following preferences on a student\r\n- modality preferences: require online, prefer online, discourage online, no preference\r\n- back-to-back preference: prefer back-to-backs, discourage back-to-backs, no preferences\r\n- class dates: optional class start date and class end date\r\n- when a class is outside of the class dates or it is not online and online is required,\r\n- the class appears like it would be disabled (can be overridden by a reservation)\r\n- using Section.isEnabled(Student) which replaces Section.isEnabled()\r\n- student schedule quality changes\r\n- penalisation can now consider the student and their preferences\r\n- it is now also possible to have a negative penalisation\r\n- added Modality criterion\r\n- weight StudentWeights.ModalityFactor, defaults to 0.0500\r\n- for students with prefer/discourage online, there is a penalisation for classes with mismatching modality\r\n- BackToBack criterion now considers student's back-to-back preference\r\n- can return negative weight for a back-to-back conflict when back-to-backs are discouraged\r\n- online sectioning: OnlineSection has now an ability to override class status (enabled/disabled)\r\n- classes that the student is enrolled in are considered always enabled (regardless of the student's preference)\r\n\r\n*Revision 8cee838 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (31-Mar-2022 2:22 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Log4j dependency updated to 2.17.1 (was 2.17.0)\r\n- this is to avoid

Assignment\r\n- backtrack and student swap now also listen for failed neibhours, putting the failed\r\n  student/request back into the queue\r\n- improving success of each phase, especially when there

requesting multiple courses of a cross-listed course\r\n  as alternatives to each other\r\n\r\n*Revision 1639c6f by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (13-Nov-2020 5:16 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Branch & Bound\r\n- when a neigbour (class schedule of a student) fails to be assigned, e.g., because the last spot\r\n  in a class got taken:\r\n- put the student back at the beginning of the queue (instead of the end)\r\n- this is to ensure that student priority is beter considered (priority student does not get\r\n  bumped at the end of the list)\r\n\r\n*Revision 4b8c09d by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (13-Nov-2020 2:06 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Request Bound\r\n- improved computation of course request bound in an attempt to improve the branching\r\n- include penalization for arrange hours, online, selection and intitial placement if it cannot be\r\n  avoided\r\n(e.g., when all enrollments are online)\r\n\r\n*Revision 5d0b726 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (12-Nov-2020 9:04 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Same Dates Group Constraint\r\n- added a new group constraint SAME_DATES\r\n- given classes must be taught on the same dates\r\n- if one of the classes meets more often, the class meeting less often can only meet on the dates\r\n  when the other class is meeting\r\n- when prohibited or (strongly) discouraged: given classes cannot be taught on the same days\r\n  (there cannot be a date when both classes are meeting)\r\n- note: unlike with the same days/weeks constraint, this constraint consider individual meeting\r\n  dates of both classes\r\n\r\n*Revision 0e491d2 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (11-Nov-2020 6:04 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Branch & Bound Selection\r\n- value ordering: among enrollments that are otherwise very close to each other (in terms of their\r\n  value), prefer those that do not have a time conflict with a lower priority course which has\r\n  only a few possible enrollments (five or less)\r\n\r\n*Revision 835f055 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (11-Nov-2020 5:34 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Priority Students\r\n- student priority changed from being a boolean (priority yes/no) to have five layers of priority\r\n  students\r\n- named Priority > Senior > Junior > Sophomore > Freshmen > Normal (no priority)\r\n- students of higher priority are assigned before students of lower priority\r\n- combined with course request priority depending on\r\n  Sectioning.PriorityStudentsFirstSelection.AllIn\r\n- when true, student priority takes precedence Critical Priority > Non-Critical Priority >\r\n  Critical Senior ...\r\n- when false, request priority takes precedence Critical Priority > Critical Senior > ... >\r\n  Non-Critical

<muller@unitime.org> (8-Jan-2020 3:18 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Request Priority\r\n- added ability to put a multiple levels to critical courses\r\n- by default, there are three levels: critical > important > normal\r\n- critical course request are assigned first, then important requests, then the rest\r\n- more levels can be defined in the future by just extending the RequestPriority enum\r\n\r\n*Revision a052701 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (17-Dec-2019 1:35 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Room Sharing\r\n- more precise computation of allowed room sharing (how much space is needed in a room)\r\n- this is to avoid issues when three or more classes can share a room and some of these classes do\r\n  not overlap\r\n(e.g., no more than two classes overlap when there is a Monday class, a Wednesday class, and\r\na Monday-Wednesday class)\r\n\r\n*Revision 6d3c8b1 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (27-Nov-2019 9:58 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Reservations\r\n- added ability to have reservation restrictions that are not inclusive\r\n(that is, if a reservation is on a class, the reservation does not include the configuration and\r\nall the parents of said class)\r\n- such a reservation only contains sections/configurations on which the restrictions are set, and\r\n  this reservation is only checked on these levels\r\n- use Reservation.addSection(section, false) to skip the inclusion of the section's parent(s) and\r\n  configuration\r\n- is included, restrictivity, and limit cap is computed differently for such a reservation\r\n- offering's unreserved space does not include such reservations when they have any restrictions\r\n- while such reservations are more permissive, they avoid issues with double booking of the same\r\n  space (e.g., having two reservations on the same section)\r\n\r\n*Revision 0ee42ac by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (5-Nov-2019 9:59 PM)*\r\n"}

exception\r\n\r\n*Revision 4298d78 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (20-Nov-2018 4:33 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Student Schedule Quality\r\n- added a new extension, names StudentQuality replacing both DistanceConflict and\r\n  TimeOverlapsCounter\r\n- besides of time and distance conflicts, the following criteria have been added:\r\n- lunch breaks (allow time for lunch): there is a lunch conflict created when the student has two\r\n  classes on a day that overlap with the lunch period of 11 am - 1 pm with less than 30 minutes in\r\n  between\r\n- travel time: there is a conflict proportional to the travel time (in minutes) between two\r\n  classes on the same day that are less than 1 hour apart (or less than 2 hours apart when the\r\n  travel time is longer than the break time of the first class -- 10 minutes for most classes)\r\n- back-to-back: there is a (negatively weighted) conflict for any two classes that are\r\n  back-to-back and on the same day (the idea is to minimize gaps, so we want more classes\r\n  clustered together)\r\n- workday: there is a conflict when the student has two classes that have more than six hours\r\n  between the start of the first one and the end of the second one; the conflict is proportional\r\n  to the number of hours over this limit (e.g., if the two classes span 8 hours, the penalty is 2)\r\n  -- again the idea is to make the schedule more compact, without unnecessary gaps\r\n- too early: there is a conflict when the class starts before 8:30 am (proportional to the time of\r\n  the class before 8:30)\r\n- too late: there is a conflict when the class ends after 5:30 pm (proportional to the time of the\r\n  class after 5:30)\r\n\r\n*Revision 3b0ccdc by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (20-Nov-2018 2:17 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Nightly Builds\r\n- build maven to target folder (instead of dist)\r\n- clean target folder before and after making and deploying a new SNAPSHOT build\r\n\r\n*Revision 4eda065 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (1-Nov-2018 7:19 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Required Choices\r\n- added ability for a student to require sections and/or configurations\r\n\r\n*Revision f728962 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (16-Oct-2018 8:33 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Examination Solver: added Same Day distribution constrain (#14)\r\n- corrected ExamDistributionConstraint.isSatisfied(Assignment, Placement) for different day\r\n\r\n*Revision a37ddc4 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (10-Oct-2018 6:26 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Examination Solver: added Same Day distribution constrain (#14)\r\n\r\n*Revision 36c1382 by rafati <rafat.ishaq@gmail.com> (10-Oct-2018 6:17 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling Solver: Info\r\n- show balancing parameters in the same format as the others\r\n- that is: percentage% (value)\r\n- instead of: value (percentage%)\r\n\r\n*Revision 820bd00 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (10-Oct-2018 5:56 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Parallel Solver: neighbour.assignments()\r\n- catch any exceptions thrown by neighbour.assignments()\r\n\r\n*Revision 01b8847 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (10-Oct-2018 5:54 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Batch Student Scheduling: Backtrack Selection\r\n- when it is allowed to select assigned requests (Neighbour.IncludeAssignedRequests is true)\r\n- skip all assigned free time requests\r\n- skip all assigned course requests that have no selection preferenes and already have the primary\r\n  course assigned\r\n\r\n*Revision c961ad1 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (6-Oct-2018 8:10 AM)*\r\n\r\n#### Batch Student Scheduling: Swap Enrollments Selection\r\n- corrected a possible null exception when a course requests becomes unassigned during the search\r\n\r\n*Revision 8b5dc18 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (5-Oct-2018 8:31 AM)*\r\n\r\n#### Parallel Solver: Logging\r\n- changed logging of \"Failed to select a neighbour\" errors to debug\r\n(but include stack trace)\r\n\r\n*Revision e698330 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (4-Oct-2018 5:05 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Batch Student Scheduling: Swap Enrollments Selection\r\n- added a selection that swaps enrollments of different students of a course\r\n- this is to improve the enrollment alternativity as well as selection preferences\r\n- only triggers on assigned course requests that do not have the primary course (first course in\r\n  the list) or that have section or instructional method preferences\r\n\r\n*Revision f325cf4 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (4-Oct-2018 5:02 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling Solver: Info\r\n- few minor changes\r\n- do not show weighted value of time and distance conflicts\r\n- do not log student has no requests warnings\r\n- include assigned course requests and selections in the toString(Assignment) method\r\n\r\n*Revision 19b3ffd by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (4-Oct-2018 4:58 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling Solver: Can Inherit Context\r\n- solver model as well as the two extensions (distance conflicts and time overlaps) now implement\r\n  the CanInheritContext interface\r\n- this makes for a faster copy of the context (when multiple solver threads are used)\r\n- this also fixes a small glitch in the backtracking neighbour where the total value of the\r\n  initial problem could have been incorrectly computed\r\n(not including time overlaps or distance conflicts if the two context have not been copied over\r\nyet)\r\n\r\n*Revision 1b575ce by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (4-Oct-2018 2:59 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Added Request Priority Report\r\n- this reports lists all the requested courses and their properties, namely:\r\n- Alternative is 1 when the course was requested as an alternative (Primary is 0 or Alternativity\r\n  is above 0)\r\n- Enrollet is 1 when the student is enrolled in the course\r\n- Primary is 1 when the request is from the Course Requests table, 0 when it is from the Alternate\r\n  Course Requests table\r\n- Priority is the request's priority\r\n- Alternativity is the request's alternativity (0 for the primary course, 1 for the first\r\n  alternative, 2 for the second alternative, etc.)\r\n\r\n*Revision c31c5e5 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (27-Sep-2018 5:20 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Min Credits\r\n- first attempt to maximize the number of students that have less than min credits assigned\r\n- added an initial stage that takes one student at a time and assign at least the given number of\r\n  credits (students with no min credit are skipped)\r\n- other stages: do not unassign a request that would get a student under the min credit\r\n\r\n*Revision c78761e by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (24-Sep-2018 9:16 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Min Credit\r\n- added min credits (for each student)\r\n\r\n*Revision 9a52bfb by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (24-Sep-2018 9:15 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Config\r\n- added instructional method reference\r\n\r\n*Revision 187dfeb by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (24-Sep-2018 9:14 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Test\r\n- fixed a null exception when there is a class with no time placements\r\n\r\n*Revision d84b606 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (15-Sep-2018 9:39 AM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Distribution Constraints\r\n- changed visibility of a few methods and attributes so that the weighting schema of distribution\r\n  constraints can be altered through inheritance\r\n\r\n*Revision 311bce1 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (15-Sep-2018 9:37 AM)*\r\n\r\n#### Online Student Scheduling: Priority Criterion\r\n- do not consider reservations when comparing two enrollments for alternativity\r\n\r\n*Revision 9e5ebe9 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (10-Sep-2018 9:11 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: XML Load\r\n- do not load initial value as assignment (if assignment is not provided)\r\n- do not load currently assigned value as best assignment (if best is not provided)\r\n- log assignment issues to solver log\r\n\r\n*Revision 72611b9 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (5-Sep-2018 6:52 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Constants: Preference Penalties\r\n- allow preference penalties to be changed (removed final)\r\n\r\n*Revision 7fc9a1e by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (5-Sep-2018 6:17 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Group Constraint\r\n- added ability to parametrize group constraints\r\n(a group constraint can take any number, not just the ones for which there is a record in the\r\nConstraintType enum)\r\n- MAX_HRS_DAY, WORKDAY, and MIN_GAP can now take any number of hours (including a floating point\r\n  number)\r\n(e.g., WORKDAY(7.5) for a workday of 7.5 hours, 90 slots)\r\n\r\n*Revision 661680b by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (5-Sep-2018 6:03 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Best Penalty Criterion\r\n- corrected canImprove(...) method: penalties are double (not int)\r\n\r\n*Revision 24fc9c4 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (14-Aug-2018 6:17 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Minimize Conflicts\r\n- corected OverExpected.ParentWeight parameter\r\n\r\n*Revision e086931 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (14-Aug-2018 6:16 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Max Credit\r\n- added ability to define max credit of a student\r\n- a student, with max credit cannot get courses that exceeed the given credit\r\n- also his/her schedule is considered complete when any unassigned course would get him/her over\r\n  the max credit\r\n\r\n*Revision 3cf78cd by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (14-Aug-2018 6:15 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Extended Solution Info\r\n- added % of assigned course requests that are not alternatives (named Assigned priority course\r\n  requests)\r\n- added numbers of students that are missing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ courses\r\n\r\n*Revision 6514270 by

sections\r\n\r\n*Revision 6d13138 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (23-Oct-2017 1:45 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Student Scheduling: Course Reservation\r\n- corrected default: can assign over limit is false (DEFAULT_CAN_ASSIGN_OVER_LIMIT = false)\r\n\r\n*Revision 3e9e19c by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (20-Oct-2017 1:50 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Online Student Scheduling: Build Schedule\r\n- prefer sections that are not available (there is space in them)\r\n- this is especially useful when a student has an individual reservation that is not given for\r\n  a particular section or for special registration (student is allowed to pick any section)\r\n\r\n*Revision 680fc5d by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (12-Oct-2017 7:37 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Online Student Scheduling: Suggestions\r\n- put selected sections higher in the list\r\n\r\n*Revision b6ebf4b by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (12-Oct-2017 5:27 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Max Half-Days Constraint\r\n- fixed an ArrayOutOfBounds exception\r\n\r\n*Revision 77c6eac by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (10-Oct-2017 9:24 PM)*"}

Scheduling Assistant Weights\r\n- corrected precision on the selected choices criterion as the result is a % of the selected\r\n  classes\r\n\r\n*Revision 23f80ad by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (9-Oct-2017 1:51 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Max Half-Days Constraint\r\n- the MaxHalfDays constraint limits the number of half-days of week during which the given set of\r\n  classes are taught\r\n- it has one parameter: a maximal number of week half-days during which the given set of classes\r\n  can be placed\r\n- a day is split by noon (which can be changed using General.HalfDaySlot parameter)\r\n- a class starting before noon is considered a morning class (despite of its end), a class\r\n  starting at noon or later is considered an afternoon class\r\n- For instance, a reference _MaxHalfDays:4_ translates to a maximum number of 4 half-days a week\r\n\r\n*Revision 0bbc75d by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (8-Oct-2017 3:57 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Examination

strongly preferred, etc. period is selected for an exam)\r\n\r\n*Revision 456fbdf by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (8-Oct-2017 12:03 PM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: added MaxHoles distribution constraint\r\n- the MaxHoles constraint limits the number of free time (holes) for an instructor on a day\r\n  (between the first and the last class on a day)\r\n- it has one parameter: a maximal amount of free time that an instructor can have on a day in\r\n  minutes\r\n- for example, reference _MaxHoles:120_ translates to a maximum number of two hours of total free\r\n  time between the first and the last class on a day\r\n- if required, having more free time is prohibited\r\n- if preferred or strongly preferred, the excessive free time is penalized\r\n\r\n*Revision 240e858 by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (8-Oct-2017 11:59 AM)*\r\n\r\n#### Course Timetabling: Student Conflicts\r\n- added a naive, yet effective approach for minimizing holes in student schedule\r\n- the new StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles criterion penalizes all cases where a student has two\r\n  classes taught on the same day that are not back-to-back\r\n- the penalization is based on the time distance between the two classes, computed in hours\r\n- these penalties are weighted by Comparator.MinimizeStudentScheduleHolesWeight, which defaults to\r\n  1/20 of the Comparator.StudentConflictWeight\r\n- to enable this criterion, add\r\n  org.cpsolver.coursett.criteria.additional.StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles to\r\n  General.AdditionalCriteria\r\n- added a naive, yet effective approach for minimizing number of days in student schedule\r\n- the new StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek criterion penalizes all cases where a student has two classes\r\n  taught on different days\r\n- these penalties are weighted by Comparator.MinimizeStudentScheduleDaysWeight, which defaults to\r\n  1/20 of the Comparator.StudentConflictWeight\r\n- to enable this criterion, add\r\n  org.cpsolver.coursett.criteria.additional.StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek to\r\n  General.AdditionalCriteria\r\n- as the StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles criterion tends to spread the student among as many days as\r\n  possible, the second criterion StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek can be used to counteract this effect,\r\n  if desired\r\n\r\n*Revision f62c1cf by tomas-muller <muller@unitime.org> (8-Oct-2017 11:51

computation of the student swap impact on the student group value\r\n- objective value (combining student conflicts and student groups) can no longer be negative\r\n- use deterministic initial sectioning if there are student groups (it better keeps students of\r\n  the same group together)\r\nInitial Student Sectioning\r\n- improved checking of section limit when students are weighted to

DAY_SLOTS_FIRST)\nGeneral.LastDaySlot (defaults to 209 ~ 5:30 pm, same as DAY_SLOTS_LAST)\nGeneral.FirstWorkDay (defaults to 0)\nGeneral.LastWorkDay (defaults to 4, NR_DAYS_WEEK - 1)\n```\n- this fixes #1\n- there are still some constants that cannot be changed (a week has 7 days, there are 288 slots\n  a day, each 5 minute long)\n  (changing these constants would require a lot of effort and the current configuration is deemed\n  general enough)\n\n_Revision 85d9775 by tomas-muller muller@unitime.org (19-Jan-2016 3:08 PM)_\n\n#### Online Student Scheduling: Suggestions\n- when the number
