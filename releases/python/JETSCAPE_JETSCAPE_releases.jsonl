Currently only recombination in vacuum is implemented.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Photons are produced in the hard scattering, MATTER vacuum shower,  and MARTINI shower. There is no separate channel for photon production in the medium modified MATTER shower, LBT, AdS/CFT modules.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The gluon to heavy quark-antiquark pair in vacuum splitting routine is included but not linked in MATTER. \r\nThis is done to warn the user that the medium modified version of this split has not been implemented. Thus, while leading heavy-hadron modification can be calculated, modification of heavy-quark-tagged-jets cannot be reliably calculated in this version of JETSCAPE.\r\n\r\n\u2022 There is also no implementation of broadening (in MATTER) and energy deposition. \r\n\r\n\u2022 The output of the parton shower was changed in several cases. In LBT, 1->1 processes are no longer written as a new vertex, since these correspond to the free-streaming processes. In MARTINI, soft partons below some threshold are dropped, resulting in 1->1 processes -- these are now correctly labeled as 1->2 processes by the liquefier module, which adds back the missing energy-momentum at those vertices.\r\n"}
