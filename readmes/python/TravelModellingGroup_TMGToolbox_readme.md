TMGToolbox for Emme
==========

The TMG Toolbox is a suite of Python tools written for **Emme** transportation planning software. Emme itself is a product of INRO Consultants, Inc.; however the TMG Toolbox is open-source under GPL3.0 (see license file for full text)

The TMG Toolbox is developed by the Travel Modelling Group at the University of Toronto. The authors hope that this toolbox will improve the practise of operational transportation planning by facilitating advanced analyses of travel demand forecasting models implemented in Emme.

Deployment instructions:
 
  1. The toolbox works best with Emme 4 or newer (and not at all supported by versions older than Emme 3.4). Some tools work better in Emme 4.1, so be sure to grab the latest version.
  2. Using Git, download the source code to your local machine.
  3. Double-click on  "Build Toolbox.bat". This will generate the file "TMG_Toolbox.mtbx" in the same folder.
  4. In Emme, open Modeller
  5. In Modeller, right-click on 'Toolboxes' (by default in the upper-left corner), and click on 'Add a Toolbox' in the context menu.
  6. Browse to the location of TMG_Toolbox.mtbx and click 'Save' to add the toolbox to your current Emme project.
