Also completely replace the implementation of deploy keys, secret variables and group secret variables with a new universal one. This possibly fixes [#19](https://github.com/gdubicki/gitlabform/issues/19).\r\n* **Up to 40% faster thanks to making less requests to GitLab.** (For almost 1000 repositories the apply time has dropped from ~18 minutes to ~11 minutes.)\r\n* With debug enabled a lot less duplication and a more readable output of dicts (shown as JSONs).\r\n* **For Contributors** Introduce `SingleEntityProcessor` that generalizes editing things that are single per project, f.e. settings or push rules set. It does not edit entities if there are no changes to be applied. Using it implementing new features can be superfast! (See also `MultipleEntitiesProcessor` added in v2.2.0).\r\n* **For Contributors** Faster tests and improved usage of fixtures.\r\n\r\n(A pre-release of 2.9.2 RC1 contained some of the above changes. 2.10.0rc1 pre-release was the same as 2.10.0 final but with a slightly different changelog - the speed gains turned out to be higher than expected.)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabform/gitlabform/releases/56775683/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

The main change is introducing a new way to implement \"processors\" - thanks to a generalized `MultipleEntitiesProcessor` class adding a new feature like Project Badges should is now as easy as implementing a class like `BadgesProcessor` and writing an acceptance test like `TestBadges`. Note that this new design may change in the near future and we are open to discussions and PRs to make it even better! We also plan to create a similar generalized `SingleEntityProcessor` class soon.\r\n\r\n* Change the User Agent that the app uses when making requests to GitLab to a custom `GitLabForm/<gitlabform_version> (python-requests/<requests_version>)`."}
