You may have a look at the previous release if you don't like this one.\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\nThe first thing you'll notice is that the output now uses colors, and that more information is shown. Please let me know how you like it!\r\n\r\n## Liquidity Limits vs. 50% ratio\r\nUnder the hood, the most important change is that the rebalance amount does *not* target a 50% ratio anymore.\r\nWhile all previous versions worked towards a perfect 50/50 balance, from now on the script works towards having \"enough\" funds on both sides of the channels.\r\n**By default, those limits are both 1M sat for outbound liquidity (funds on your side of the channel) and inbound liquidity (funds on the remote side of the channel).**\r\nThese values are configurable.\r\n\r\nAs such, if you use the script to send funds **to** a large (say, 50M sat) channel where 100% of the funds are on the remote side, you might end up with 1M / 49M. If you want to send more than that, you can specify the amount directly (`-a`), or use a higher value for `--min-local`.\r\n\r\nThis change also means that more funds may be taken **out** of a channel.\r\nAs an example, if you send 2M sat to a channel you specified using `--to`, the script automatically considers all channels as possible sources that have at least 1M + 2M sat of inbound liquidity, so that after the rebalance transaction the limit of 1M inbound liquidity still is met.\r\n\r\n## Fees\r\nThe previously introduced `--econ-fee` mode is now the default, and the old fee limits do not exist anymore.\r\nAs such, the script only allows rebalance transactions that are economically viable.\r\nIn short, the script only takes funds out of a channel if you'd earn more for routing those funds through the destination channel.\r\nPlease have a look at the README to read more about this reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe script automatically ignores channels that are \"too expensive\", so that the viable routes should be found more quickly.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/C-Otto/rebalance-lnd/releases/46847281/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 6, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
