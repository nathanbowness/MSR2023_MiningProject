OpenKeeper
=================

An open source remake of the Dungeon Keeper II game and engine.

Goal is to fully implement the game (version 1.7 with 3 bonus packs) as open source cross platform version, with minimal or no changes at all, using the original game assets. So it will require the original game to play / develop. Future development could have fan made graphics (to at least enable standalone version) and features.

OpenKeeper is written in Java using [JMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/). Currently we are using JME 3.5 + Java 17.

Builds are available from the CI:
