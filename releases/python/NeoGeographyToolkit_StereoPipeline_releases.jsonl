May 18, 2022\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nNew camera additions:\r\n  * Added support for the USGSCSM Frame, SAR, and PushFrame sensors\r\n    (until now just the Linescan sensor was supported), together \r\n    with documentation and examples (for Dawn, MiniRF, and WAC,\r\n    respectively).\r\n  * Added support for ISIS SAR cameras, together with an example in\r\n    the doc.\r\n  * Added support for the PeruSat-1 linescan camera model (so far just\r\n    the RPC model was supported for this satellite).\r\n\r\nNew tool additions:\r\n  * Added the program ``corr_eval``, for evaluating the quality of\r\n    produced correlation with several metrics. See also the new option\r\n    ``--save-left-right-disparity-difference`` in ``parallel_stereo``.\r\n  * Added the program ``otsu_threshold`` for computing an image\r\n    threshold. It can be used for separating land from water (in\r\n    WorldView multispectral NIR bands), and shadowed from lit areas\r\n    (in Lunar images).\r\n  * The program ``parallel_stereo`` can function as purely an image\r\n    correlation tool, without assuming any camera information, via\r\n    the option ``--correlator-mode``.\r\n  * Added the program ``image_align``. Used to align two images or\r\n    DEMs based on interest point matches or disparity, with given\r\n    alignment transform type (translation, rigid, similarity, affine,\r\n    and homography).\r\n\r\nisis:\r\n  * Using ISIS 6.0.0.\r\n\r\ncsm:\r\n  * Save the camera state on multiple lines. On reading both the\r\n    single-line and multiple-line formats are accepted.\r\n  * Bundle adjustment, mapproject, and SfS with the CSM model can be\r\n    7-15 times faster than done with the corresponding ISIS model for \r\n    linescan cameras (the latter as reimplemented in ASP itself).  \r\n    It is strongly suggested to use CSM for large-scale processing.\r\n  * Bugfix in CSM linescan implementation for some LRO NAC sensors.\r\n    Also replaced the fixed-point method with the secant method in the \r\n    ground-to-image logic for CSM linescan cameras, which is faster. \r\n\r\nparallel_stereo:\r\n  * Many fixes for reliability of stereo with local epipolar alignment.\r\n  * Added the option ``--resume-at-corr``. Start at the correlation stage\r\n    and skip recomputing the valid low-res and full-res disparities for\r\n    that stage.\r\n  * Bugfix: Eliminate edge artifacts in stereo refinement (for\r\n    subpixel modes 1, 2, and 3).\r\n  * Print in stereo_pprc the estimated convergence angle for the given\r\n    stereo pair (for alignment methods affineepipolar, local_epipolar, and\r\n    homography).\r\n  * Added the option ``--prev-run-prefix``, which makes parallel_stereo\r\n    start at the triangulation stage while using previous stages\r\n    from this other run. The new run can have different cameras, different\r\n    session (rpc vs dg, isis vs csm), different bundle\r\n    adjustment prefix, and different bathy planes (if applicable).\r\n  * Added option ``--save-left-right-disparity-difference`` to save the\r\n    discrepancy between left-to-right and right-to-left\r\n    disparities, which may help with filtering unreliable\r\n    disparities.\r\n  * Interest point matching with mapprojected images now happens\r\n    at full resolution, which results in a more reliable process\r\n    when there are clouds or if fine features are washed out at\r\n    low resolution.\r\n  * Expanded the doc to address a big gotcha: if left and right\r\n    mapprojected images have somewhat different resolutions, then an\r\n    immense disparity search range can result.\r\n  * Added the option ``--max-disp-spread`` to limit the spread of the\r\n    disparity to this value (useful with clouds in images).\r\n  * Added the option ``--ip-filter-using-dem`` to filter as outliers\r\n    interest point matches whose triangulated height differs by more\r\n    than given value from the height at the same location for the\r\n    given DEM.\r\n  * Added a doc section on handling of images with clouds.\r\n  * Disable by default velocity aberration and atmospheric refraction\r\n    corrections. These are not accurate enough and cause issues with\r\n    convergence of bundle adjustment. Can be enabled with\r\n    ``--enable-correct-velocity-aberration`` and\r\n    ``--enable-correct-atmospheric-refraction``. These improve results\r\n    however with Digital Globe cameras if not desired to do bundle\r\n    adjustment. (Note that these are still hard-coded as enabled for\r\n    optical bar camera models. This would require further study.)\r\n  * Added ready-made ASTER and LRO NAC examples with sample images,\r\n    cameras, commands, and outputs, all available for\r\n    download. Contributions of more examples are welcome. See\r\n    https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples.\r\n  * Bugfix for ASTER cameras; this was fully broken.\r\n  * ASP's SGM and MGM algorithms will always use the cross-check for\r\n    disparity by default, to improve the quality, even if that takes\r\n    more time. It can be turned off with ``--xcorr-threshold -1``.\r\n  * Filter outliers in low-resolution disparity D_sub.tif. Can be\r\n    turned off by setting the percentage in ``--outlier-removal-params``\r\n    to 100.\r\n  * Filtering of interest points based on percentiles (using also\r\n    ``--outlier-removal-params``).\r\n  * Folded ``--remove-outliers-by-disparity-params`` into\r\n    ``--outlier-removal-params``. \r\n  * Bugfix in disparity search range handling when it is large. \r\n  * For Linux, in each tile's directory write the elapsed runtime and\r\n    memory usage to ``<tile prefix>-<prog name>-resource-usage.txt``.\r\n  * Removed the ``--local-homography`` option, as it is superseded by \r\n    ``--alignment-method local_epipolar``, which blends the local results.\r\n  * The stereo tool is deprecated, and can be used only with the\r\n    ASP_BM classical block-matching algorithm when invoked without\r\n    local epipolar alignment. Use parallel_stereo instead. \r\n  * Added the experimental ``--gotcha-disparity-refinement`` option, under\r\n    NASA proposal 19-PDART19_2-0094.\r\n \r\nbundle_adjust:\r\n  * Add the option ``--apply-initial-transform-only`` to apply an initial\r\n    transform to cameras while skipping image matching and other\r\n    steps, making the process much faster.\r\n  * Added the option ``--auto-overlap-params`` to automatically compute\r\n    which camera images overlap, if a DEM and camera footprint\r\n    expansion percentage are given. \r\n  * Add the option ``--max-pairwise-matches`` to put an upper limit on\r\n    the number of matches, as a large number can slow down bundle\r\n    adjustment. The default is 10000, likely a large overestimate (but\r\n    this includes potential outliers). If creating interest points\r\n    from disparity using ``--num-matches-from-disp-triplets``, similar\r\n    values should be used for both of these options.\r\n  * Stop printing warnings about failed triangulation if their number\r\n    goes over 100.\r\n  * Rename verbose ``final_residuals_no_loss_function_pointmap_point_log.csv``\r\n    to ``final_residuals_pointmap.csv`` and\r\n    ``final_residuals_no_loss_function_raw_pixels.txt`` to \r\n    ``final_residuals_raw_pixels.txt``, etc.\r\n  * Document the useful initial and final ``residuals_stats.txt`` files. \r\n  * Add new options for reusing a previous run:\r\n    ``--match-files-prefix`` and ``--clean-match-files-prefix``.\r\n\r\nsfs:\r\n  * SfS was made to work with any camera model supported by ASP,\r\n    including for Earth. For non-ISIS and non-CSM cameras, the option\r\n    ``--sun-positions`` should be used.\r\n  * Exhaustively tested with the CSM model. It is very recommended to\r\n    use that one instead of ISIS .cub cameras, to get a very large\r\n    speedup and multithreading. \r\n  * Added a new ``--gradient-weight`` parameter, constraining the \r\n    first-order derivatives. Can be used in combination with the\r\n    ``--smoothness-weight`` parameter which constrains the second-order\r\n    derivatives. The goal is to avoid a noisy solution without losing\r\n    detail.\r\n  * Much work on expanding the documentation.\r\n\r\nmapproject:\r\n  * If the input image file has an embedded RPC camera model, append\r\n    it to the output mapprojected file. (Which makes stereo with\r\n    mapprojected images work correctly in this case.)\r\n  * Always start a process for each tile. The default tile size \r\n    is set to 5120 for non-ISIS cameras and to 1024 for ISIS. Use\r\n    a large value of ``--tile-size`` to use fewer processes.\r\n\r\nbathymetry:\r\n  * Can have different water surfaces in left and right images, so the\r\n    triangulating rays bend at different heights.\r\n  * ``bathy_plane_calc`` can use a mask of pixels above water to find the\r\n    water-land interface, and also a set of actual ``lon, lat, height``\r\n    measurements.\r\n  * Added documentation for how to find water level heights at given \r\n    times and coordinates using National Ocean Service's tidal zoning\r\n    map.\r\n \r\npc_align:\r\n  * Add alignment method similarity-point-to-plane. It works better\r\n    than similarity-point-to-point to find a scale between the clouds.\r\n  * Bugfix with alignment methods point-to-point and\r\n    similarity-point-to-point.\r\n  * Use RANSAC with ``--initial-transform-from-hillshading``, for increased\r\n    robustness to outliers. Replaced\r\n    ``--initial-transform-outlier-removal-params`` (based on percentiles)\r\n    with ``--initial-transform-ransac-params``.\r\n\r\ndem_mosaic:\r\n  * Add the option ``--tap``, to have the output grid be at integer\r\n    multiples of the grid size (like the default behavior of\r\n    ``point2dem`` and ``mapproject``, and ``gdalwarp`` when invoked\r\n    with ``-tap``). If not set, the input grids determine\r\n    the output grid.\r\n  * Do not allow more than one of these operations in a given\r\n    dem_mosaic invocation: fill holes, blur, or erode. These won't\r\n    work when also having more than one input DEM, reprojection is\r\n    desired, or priority blending length is used. This is done to\r\n    avoid confusion about order of operations, and the fact that\r\n    different input DEMs can have different grid sizes and hence the\r\n    input parameters have different effects on each.\r\n  * Bugfix for hole-filling and blurring. Tile artifacts got removed.\r\n\r\nstereo_gui: \r\n  * Can cycle through given images from the View menu, or with the 'n'\r\n    and 'p' keys, when all images are in the same window.\r\n  * Can save a shapefile having points, segments, or polygons. (These\r\n    are distinct classes for a shapefile; the shapefile format\r\n    requires that these not be mixed in the same file.)\r\n  * Noticeable speedup when changing display mode (e.g., from\r\n    side-by-side to overlayed).\r\n  * Bugfix when overlaying shapefiles with different georeferences.\r\n  * Polygon layers can be set to desired colors from the left pane,\r\n    when overlaid.\r\n  * On startup, draw rectangular regions corresponding to values of\r\n    ``--left-image-crop-win`` and ``--right-image-crop-win``, if these\r\n    are passed in as command line arguments together with two images.\r\n * Quietly accept parallel_stereo options and pass them on if this tool\r\n   is invoked from the GUI.\r\n\r\nimage_calc:\r\n  * Add the option ``--no-georef`` to remove any georeference\r\n    information in the output image (useful with subsequent GDAL-based\r\n    processing).\r\n  * Added the option ``--longitude-offset`` to help to deal with the\r\n    fact that ASP-produced DEMs and orthoimages may have the\r\n    longitudes in [0, 360] while users may prefer [-180, 180].\r\n  * Bugfix: The ``--input-nodata`` value, if set, now overrides the\r\n    value set in the metadata (the previous value then becomes valid).\r\n\r\nMisc:\r\n  * Added the tool ``parse_match_file.py`` to convert a binary match file\r\n    to text and vice-versa.\r\n  * Add the tool ``cam_test`` to compare two different camera models\r\n    for the same image. \r\n  * Stereo and bundle adjustment with RPC cameras now query the RPC\r\n    model for the datum.\r\n  * The ``cam2rpc`` program saves its datum which is read when needed by\r\n    the RPC model loader.\r\n  * Add the option ``--triangulation-error-factor`` to ``point2las`` to allow\r\n    point cloud triangulation errors multiplied by this factor and\r\n    rounded/clamped appropriately to be stored in the 2-byte intensity\r\n    field in the LAS file.\r\n  * Make symlinks relative in ``parallel_bundle_adjust`` for portability.\r\n  * The mapprojected image saves as metadata the adjustments it was\r\n    created with.\r\n  * Save the low-resolution triangulated point cloud (``PC_sub.tif``) in \r\n    stereo_corr (based on filtered ``D_sub.tif``).\r\n  * The ``ipmatch`` program can take as input just images, with the \r\n    .vwip files looked up by extension.\r\n  * Bugfix in handling projections specified via an EPSG code.\r\n  * Bugfix when some environmental variables or the path to ASP\r\n    itself have spaces. (It happens under Microsoft WSL.)\r\n  * Bugfix for the \"too many open files\" error for large images.\r\n  * Add the build date to the ``--version`` option in the ASP tools\r\n    and to the log files.\r\n  * Bugfix in the original author's MGM implementation, accepted by\r\n    the author.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/releases/67223953/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

"https://api.github.com/repos/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/tarball/3.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/zipball/3.0.0", "body": "RELEASE 3.0.0, July 27, 2021\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nNew functionality:\r\n  * Added new stereo algorithms: MGM (original author implementation),\r\n    OpenCV SGBM, LIBELAS, MSMW, MSMW2, and OpenCV BM to complement  \r\n    the existing ASP block matching, SGM, and MGM algorithms. See\r\n    https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/next_steps.html\r\n    for usage. These will be further refined in subsequent releases.\r\n  * Added the ability to perform piecewise local epipolar alignment\r\n    for the input images, to be followed by a 1D disparity search (for\r\n    non-mapprojected images), as suggested by the Satellite Stereo\r\n    Pipeline (S2P) approach. This is still somewhat experimental.\r\n  * Added the ability for a user to plug into ASP any desired stereo\r\n    program working on image clips (cropped images) to which epipolar alignment has\r\n    been applied (as is customary in the computer vision community)\r\n    without rebuilding ASP.\r\n  * Added support for shallow-water bathymetry, so creation of terrain\r\n    models with correct depth determination for well-resolved areas under\r\n    shallow water. To be used with dg, rpc, and nadirpinhole cameras.\r\n  * Added two supporting tools for this: bathy_plane_calc and\r\n    bathy_threshold_calc.py.\r\n  * Added CCD artifact corrections for a few WV02 band 3 multispectral\r\n    images. Apart from the systematic artifacts corrected by this\r\n    logic, these images have a high-frequency unique pattern, and also\r\n    jitter, which are not corrected for. Also added tools and\r\n    documentation to easily tabulate more multispectral bands and TDI.\r\n\r\nisis:\r\n  * Upgraded to ISIS 5.0.1.\r\n  * Ship a full Python 3.6 runtime, as expected by ISIS.\r\n\r\ncsm:\r\n  * Upgraded to USGSCSM 1.5.2 (ASP's own build of it has an additional\r\n    bugfix for LRO NAC not present in the conda-forge package).\r\n  * Validated the CSM model for CTX, HiRISE, and LRO NAC cameras.\r\n  * Added documentation for how to create CSM models from .cub\r\n    cameras.\r\n  * Export the state of a CSM camera after bundle adjustment and\r\n    pc_align (only for linescan cameras supported by ISIS).\r\n \r\nparallel_stereo\r\n  * Will now throw an error if --threads is passed in, whose behavior\r\n    was not defined.\r\n  * Bugifx for Python 3.\r\n\r\nbundle_adjust:\r\n  * Added the option --heights-from-dem-robust-threshold.\r\n  * Added the option --save-intermediate-cameras to save the cameras\r\n    at each iteration.\r\n  * Added the option --match-first-to-last to match the first several\r\n    images to several last images by extending the logic of\r\n    --overlap-limit past the last image to the earliest ones.\r\n\r\npoint2las\r\n  * Remove outliers by using a percentile times a factor, in a way\r\n    analogous to point2dem.\r\n   \r\nconvert_pinhole_model:\r\n  * Improve the accuracy of the RPC approximation distortion and\r\n    undistortion.\r\n\r\nsfs:\r\n  * Added the option --shadow-threshold to be able to specify\r\n    a single shadow threshold for all images. Also added\r\n    --custom-shadow-threshold-list.\r\n  * Added the option --robust-threshold for situations when the\r\n    measured image intensity is unreliable.\r\n  * Added the option --estimate-height-errors to estimate the \r\n    uncertainty in height at each computed SfS DEM pixel.\r\n    It can be customized via --height-error-params.\r\n  * Added an auxiliary tool named sfs_blend to replace SfS\r\n    pixels with ones from the original LOLA DEM in permanently\r\n    shadowed regions.\r\n\r\nstereo_gui:\r\n  * Added the ability to find the contour of a georeferenced image at\r\n    a given threshold. (It can be later edited, saved to disk, etc.) \r\n  * Bugifxes for polygon drawing logic.\r\n  * Much more responsive for overlaying many images.\r\n\r\nimage_calc:\r\n  * Support the sign function (can help in creating masks).\r\n\r\npc_align: \r\n  * Bugifx for --initial-transform-from-hillshading with outlier\r\n    removal.\r\n  * Add the --initial-transform-outlier-removal-params to control\r\n    outlier removal when finding matches between DEMs to align\r\n    using features detected in hillshaded images or selected\r\n    manually. \r\n  * Added --initial-rotation-angle, to initialize the alignment\r\n    transform as the rotation with this angle (in degrees) around\r\n    the axis going from the planet center to the centroid of the point\r\n    cloud.\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n * Moved the daily build to the release area on GitHub, at \r\n   https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/releases\r\n * Upgraded to GDAL 2.4 and PROJ4 5.2.0. (ISIS constrains updating to\r\n   newer versions of these.)\r\n * Added the option --ip-per-image to bundle adjustment and stereo, to\r\n   detect roughly how many interest points should be found per image\r\n   (only a small fraction of them may eventually match across images).\r\n * The --min-triangulation-angle in stereo must be always positive if \r\n   set by the user. Can be set to something very small if desired.\r\n   This is a bug fix for this rarely used option (before, when set to\r\n   0 it would just reset itself to some internal non-small value).  \r\n * Bugifx for the VisionWorkbench implementation of the\r\n   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, it was giving up prematurely in\r\n   challenging situations.\r\n * Bugifx for affine epipolar alignment. Use the OpenCV function \r\n   for finding the alignment matrix instead of the ASP one as OpenCV\r\n   can filter outliers which cause issues on rare occasions. \r\n * Bugfix: Do not allow a full run to take place in a directory\r\n   where a clip was run, as that will produce incorrect results.\r\n ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/releases/46872685/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 5, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

July 27, 2020\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nNew functionality\r\n   * Support for ISIS version 4.1.10. Please set ISISDATA instead of\r\n     ISIS3DATA with this version of ISIS and ASP.\r\n   * Support for the Community Sensor Model\r\n     (https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/usgscsm)\r\n   * Ability to install ASP with conda. See INSTALLGUIDE.rst for details.\r\n   * Moved the documentation to ReStructured Text, and Sphinx-Doc. See\r\n     the documentation at: https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io\r\n   * As of this release, we have transitioned to the Semantic Versioning \r\n     2.0.0 standard (https://semver.org) for ASP.\r\n\r\nbundle_adjust\r\n   * Can first create interest point matches among mapprojected images\r\n     (automatically or manually) and use those to create matches among\r\n     the unprojected images when the latter are so dissimilar in\r\n     perspective that the direct approach fails. See --mapprojected-data.\r\n  \r\nstereo_gui\r\n   * Bugfix when zooming all images to same region when the region is\r\n     such that all images are seen fully.\r\n\r\nsfs\r\n   * Added a new very challenging example at the South Pole with drastic\r\n     illumination changes and using a non-stereo DEM as initial guess.\r\n   * Fixed a bug with craters missing under low light.\r\n   * Fixed a bug with computation of exposures in terrain with many shadows.\r\n   * Print the Sun azimuth angle for all images (useful for sorting them\r\n     by illumination conditions).\r\n\r\nhiedr2mosaic.py\r\n   * When hijitreg finds no match points between two CCDs, the program now\r\n     emits a warning message to STDOUT with a suggestion to perhaps\r\n     fiddle with hijitreg manually, and rather than fail with a\r\n     mysterious exception warning, now gracefully falls back to\r\n     assuming that there is no jitter correction between the two\r\n     CCDs that had no matches.\r\n\r\npoint2dem\r\n   * Use outlier filtering when computing the bounding box of a DEM.\r\n     The same option ``--remove-outliers-params`` controls this\r\n     just as for removing outliers by triangulation error.\r\n\r\nmapproject\r\n   * Fixed a bug when finding the extent of the mapprojected\r\n     image when the DEM to project onto spans the whole planet.\r\n\r\npoint2mesh\r\n   * Only meshes in .obj format are created. This format can be opened\r\n     in Meshlab, Blender, or some other mesh viewer.\r\n   * The osgviewer program is no longer shipped.\r\n   * Fixed a bug with invalid points not being filtered.\r\n   * Fixed a bug with insufficient precision (now it can be set \r\n     by the user and defaults to 17 digits).\r\n   * Added the option --texture-step-size to control the sampling\r\n     rate for the texture, in addition to the -s option that controls\r\n     the sampling rate for the point cloud.\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n   * Updated to C++ 11.\r\n   * Added phase subpixel correlation accuracy parameter.\r\n"}

2.6.2, June 15, 2019 ***\r\n\r\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3247734\r\n\r\n - New satellites\r\n   * Added support for SkyBox, together with a detailed example,\r\n     including how to jointly align and optimize cameras in respect\r\n     to a reference DEM, while optionally refining the intrinsics. \r\n     This approach may be helpful for other images obtained with frame\r\n     cameras and uncertain positioning information.\r\n   * Added support for CORONA KH-4B, KH-7, and KH-9 declassified images\r\n     and their panoramic (optical bar) camera models, as well as using\r\n     and optimizing camera models with RPC distortion. An example\r\n     is in the documentation. \r\n   \r\n - New tools\r\n   * Added parallel_bundle_adjust which computes image statistics and\r\n     IP matching in a parallel manner similar to parallel_stereo.\r\n   * Added the cam_gen tool to create a correctly oriented pinhole\r\n     camera model given camera intrinsics, lon-lat coordinates of the\r\n     corners (or some other pixels), and optionally a ground truth\r\n     DEM. It can also parse SkySat's video/frame_index metafile to get\r\n     this data. It can also take as input any camera supported by ASP\r\n     via --input-camera and create a most-similar pinhole camera\r\n     model with given intrinsics.\r\n   * Added the coverage_fraction tool to provide a coverage estimate\r\n     of the results of a stereo call. \r\n   * Added the image_mosaic tool which merges together images based on\r\n     interest point matches.  Can be used to stitch together Corona\r\n     scanned images.\r\n   * Added a new tool, n_align, to jointly align n clouds\r\n     (re-implemented from Matlab, works well for small clouds that are\r\n     close to each other).\r\n\r\n - stereo_rfne\r\n   * Added the option to run a non-SGM subpixel option after\r\n     running SGM/MGM.\r\n   * Added the phase correlation subpixel option. This is a Fourier\r\n     transform based method.\r\n\r\n - pc_align\r\n   * Added a new approach to finding an initial transform between\r\n     clouds, when they are DEMs, that may be more robust to large\r\n     scale or translation changes, or to noise. It is based on\r\n     hillshading the DEMs and finding interest point matches among\r\n     them, which are then used to find the transform. Can be invoked\r\n     with --initial-transform-from-hillshading <transform type>.\r\n     Supported transforms are: 'similarity' (rotation + translation +\r\n     scale), 'rigid' (rotation + translation) and 'translation'.\r\n   * Added the expression of the Euler angles in the North-East-Down\r\n     coordinate system around the center of gravity of the source\r\n     cloud.\r\n   * Bugfix: intersection of bounding boxes of the clouds takes\r\n     into account the initial transform applied to the source points.\r\n   * Added a new alignment algorithm, based on \r\n     https://github.com/IntelVCL/FastGlobalRegistration\r\n     It can be invoked with --alignment-method fgr. It can perform\r\n     better than ICP when the clouds are close enough to each\r\n     other but there is a large number of outliers, when it can\r\n     function with very large --max-displacement. It does worse if the\r\n     clouds need a big shift to align.\r\n\r\n - bundle_adjust\r\n   * Two passes of bundle adjustment (with outlier filtering after\r\n   * first pass) is now the default. \r\n   * The flag --skip-rough-homography is on by default as it usually \r\n     gives more reliable results. Use --enable-rough-homography\r\n     to turn this option back on (useful when the footprint on the \r\n     ground and difference in perspective are large).\r\n   * The flag --disable-tri-ip-filter is also the default as input\r\n     cameras may not be reliable enough for this filter. Can be \r\n     enabled back with --enable-tri-ip-filter.\r\n   * Added the --intrinsics-limits option to manually specify \r\n     intrinsic parameter limits.\r\n   * Added the --num-random-passes option to allow repeat solving \r\n     attempts with randomly distorted initial parameters.\r\n   * Added option to automatically guess overlapping images from\r\n     Worldview style XML camera files.\r\n   * Removed the non-Ceres bundle adjustment options.\r\n   * Added the option to share or not share selected intrinsic parameters\r\n     between pinhole cameras when optimizing intrinsics.\r\n   * Improvements in solving simultaneously for both intrinsics and\r\n     extrinsics of n camera images if underlying ground truth\r\n     terrain in the form of a DEM or LIDAR point cloud is\r\n     present. After this bundle adjustment, pairwise stereo and DEM\r\n     creation, the DEMs are well-aligned to the ground truth.\r\n   * Added the flag --reference-terrain-weight which, when increased,\r\n     helps align better camera images to a given reference terrain. \r\n   * Added the option --heights-from-dem. It is very helpful in \r\n     determining an unknown focal length and distortion parameters\r\n     for pinhole cameras.\r\n     It can be used together with ---heights-from-dem-weight.\r\n   * Bug fix in outlier filtering for n images.\r\n   * Updated Ceres version from 1.11 to 1.14. When optimizing with \r\n     multiple threads, results now vary slightly from run to run.\r\n     Results from single threaded runs are deterministic.\r\n   * Added a new --parameter-tolerance option. Stop when the relative\r\n     error in the variables being optimized is less than this.\r\n   * Documented the ability to create a roughly positioned \r\n     pinhole camera model from an image if its intrinsics and the \r\n     longitude and latitude (and optionally height) of its corners\r\n     (or some other pixels) are known.\r\n   * When multiple passes happen with outliers removed, match files\r\n     are not over-written, but a new clean copy of them gets saved.\r\n   * Renamed --create-pinhole-cameras to --inline-adjustments, and \r\n     distortion_params to other_intrinsics. This is needed since\r\n     for the panoramic model there will be other intrinsic\r\n     parameters as well.\r\n   *  Added the option --forced-triangulation-distance for when one\r\n     really needs to triangulate with poor cameras. Can be used with \r\n     --min-triangulation-angle 0.\r\n   * Added the option --transform-cameras-using-gcp. If there\r\n     are at least two images with each having at least 3 GCP\r\n     (each GCP need not show in more than one image), use this\r\n     to convert cameras from an abstract coordinate system to world\r\n     coordinates.\r\n   * Increased the default --num-ransac-iterations to 1000 from 100\r\n     so that the solver tries harder to find a fit.\r\n     Increased default --ip-inlier-factor from 1/15 to 0.2 to help\r\n     with getting more interest points for steep terrain with the\r\n     pinhole session.\r\n   *  Increased the default --ip-uniqueness-threshold from 0.7 \r\n     to 0.8 to allow for more interest points.\r\n   * Option to filter interest points by elevation limit and lon-lat limit\r\n     after each pass of bundle adjustment except the last.\r\n\r\n - dem_mosaic\r\n   * Added normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) output option.\r\n   * Added the option --force-projwin to create a mosaic filling\r\n     precisely the desired box specified via --t_projwin.\r\n\r\n - stereo_gui\r\n   * Added the ability to manually reposition interest points.\r\n   * Can now show non-synchronous .match files (that is, each IP\r\n     need not be present in all images).\r\n   * Added basic functionality for drawing/editing/merging polygons on\r\n   * top of georeferenced images or DEMs. The polygons can be saved as \r\n     shape files, and then used to cut out portions of images with GDAL.\r\n   * Added the option --nodata-value. Pixels with value less than \r\n     or equal to this are shown as transparent.\r\n   * Added the ability to view .vwip files (specify one per image).\r\n   * Can view (but not edit) GCP files, via --gcp-file (creating\r\n     GCP is supported in a separate mode, per the doc).\r\n   * The option --dem-file specifies a DEM to use when creating\r\n     manually picked GCP and --gcp-file specifies the name of \r\n     the GCP file to use upon saving such GCP.\r\n\r\n - mapproject\r\n   * Added the --nearest-neighbor option to use that interpolation\r\n     method instead of bicubic.  This is better for labeled images\r\n     which should not be interpolated.\r\n\r\n - convert_pinhole_model\r\n   * Can create RPC distortion models of any degree, which can be\r\n     further optimized in bundle_adjust. Old RPC distortion files are\r\n     still supported throughout ASP, but not functionality which\r\n     optimizes them. They can be approximately converted to new type\r\n     RPC distortion files with this tool if optimization is desired.\r\n\r\n- Misc\r\n   * Compiled against USGS ISIS version 3.6.0.\r\n   * Expanded the documentation explaining how to align cameras \r\n     to a DEM manually (or initialize such cameras) by selecting\r\n     matching points between the images and the DEM.\r\n   * The stereo tools and bundle_adjust will now cache image\r\n     statistics and interest points to files on disk.\r\n   * In stereo and bundle_adjust, when images or cameras are newer\r\n     than the match files, the latter get recomputed unless the tools\r\n     are invoked with --force-reuse-match-files.\r\n   * Added a fix to make stereo work with the ZY3 satellite.\r\n   * For stereo and bundle_adjust, added the --no-datum option to\r\n     find interest points without assuming a reliable datum exists,\r\n     such as for irregularly shaped bodies. Added the related\r\n     option --skip-rough-homography to not use the datum in\r\n     rough homography computation. Added the option\r\n     --ip-num-ransac-iterations for finer control of interest\r\n     point matching. Added --ip-triangulation-max-error to control\r\n     the triangulation error.\r\n   * The cam2rpc tool accepts --t_srs and --semi-major-axis as\r\n     alternatives to --datum and --dem-file.\r\n   * Add option --theia-overrides to camera_solve to make it easier\r\n     to customize its behavior via flags.\r\n   * Added an explanation for how the pinhole model works. \r\n"}

2.6.1, August 13, 2018 ***\r\n\r\n - New satellites\r\n   * Support Cartosat-1 and Perusat-1 RPC cameras.\r\n\r\n - New tools\r\n   * Added convert_pinhole_model, to convert between various\r\n     existing such models. \r\n   * Added camera_footprint as a helpful utility to show where\r\n     images will project on to the ground.\r\n   * Documented and improved the ipfind and ipmatch tools.\r\n     ipfind is used to detect interest points in input images,\r\n     either to generate .vwip files for other tools or to \r\n     experiment with different IP finding settings.\r\n     ipmatch matches the IPs contained in .vwip files to\r\n     create .match files.\r\n\r\n - New camera models\r\n    * Added simple atmospheric refraction correction to the\r\n      DG and SPOT5 camera models. This can be manually disabled\r\n      using the \"--disable-correct-atmospheric-refraction\" option.\r\n    * Added support for pinhole camera models where the lens\r\n      distortion is given by an RPC model (rational polynomial\r\n      coefficients), of degrees 4, 5, and 6. Such a model may be more\r\n      expressive than existing ones, and its coefficients can now be\r\n      optimized using bundle adjustment. An initial model can be\r\n      created with convert_pinhole_model.\r\n\r\n - stereo_corr\r\n   * Added new options for post-SGM subpixel stereo. Previously only a\r\n     parabola method was used.\r\n   * Added option to perform cross-correlation checks on multiple\r\n     resolution levels while using SGM/MGM.\r\n   * Added option --corr-search-limit to constrain the automatically\r\n     computed correlation search range.\r\n   * Added --corr-memory-limit-mb option to limit the memory usage of\r\n     the SGM/MGM algorithms.\r\n   * Improved search range estimation in nadir epipolar alignment\r\n     cases. Added --elevation-limit option to help constrain this\r\n     search range.\r\n   * Added hybrid SGM/MGM stereo option.\r\n   * Improvements to SGM search range estimation.\r\n   * Added --min-num-ip option.\r\n\r\n - bundle_adjust\r\n   * Added the ability to optimize pinhole camera intrinsic\r\n     parameters, with and without having a LIDAR or DEM ground truth\r\n     to be used as reference (the latter is recommended though).\r\n   * The tool is a lot more sensitive now to --camera-weight,\r\n     existing results may change a lot. \r\n   * Added the parameters --rotation-weight and --translation-weight\r\n     to penalize large rotation and translation changes.\r\n   * Added the option --fixed-camera-indices to keep some cameras\r\n     fixed while optimizing others. \r\n   * Can read the adjustments from a previous invocation of this\r\n     program via --input-adjustments-prefix.\r\n   * Can read each of pc_align's output transforms and apply it\r\n     to the input cameras via --initial-transform, to be able to \r\n     bring the cameras in the same coordinate system as the aligned\r\n     terrain (the initial transform can have a rotation, translation,\r\n     and scale). If --input-adjustments-prefix is specified as well,\r\n     the input adjustments are read first, and the pc_align \r\n     transform is applied on top.\r\n   * Renamed --local-pinhole to --create-pinhole-cameras.\r\n   * Added the parameter --nodata-value to ignore pixels at and below\r\n     a threshold.\r\n   * Added the ability to transfer interest points manually picked in\r\n     mapprojected images to the the original unprojected images via\r\n     --mapprojected-data.  \r\n   * Added the flag --use-lon-lat-height-gcp-error. Then, if using\r\n     GCP, the three standard deviations are interpretted as applying\r\n     not to x, y, z but to latitude, longitude, and height above\r\n     datum (in this order). Hence, if the latitude and longitude are\r\n     known accurately, while the height less so, the third standard\r\n     deviation can be set to something much larger.\r\n   * Added the ability to do multiple passes of bundle adjustment,\r\n     removing outliers at each pass based on reprojection error and\r\n     disparity (difference of pixel value between images). This\r\n     works for any number of cameras. Match files are updated with\r\n     outliers removed. Controlled via --num-passes,\r\n     --remove-outliers-params and --remove-outliers-by-disparity-params.\r\n   * Added the option --save-cnet-as-csv, to save the control\r\n     network containing all interest points in the format used by\r\n     ground control points, so it can be inspected.\r\n   * If --datum is specified, bundle_adjust will save to disk\r\n     the reprojection errors before and after optimization. \r\n\r\n - stereo_gui\r\n   * Can view SPOT5 .BIL files.\r\n\r\n - pc_align\r\n   * Add the ability to help the tool with an initial translation\r\n     specified as a North-East-Down vector, to be used to correct known\r\n     gross offsets before proceeding with alignment. The option is\r\n     --initial-ned-translation.\r\n   * When pc_align is initialized via --initial-transform or\r\n    --initial-ned-translation, the translation vector is now computed\r\n    starting from the source points before any of these initial\r\n    transforms are applied, rather than after. The end point of this\r\n    vector is still the source points after alignment to the\r\n    reference. This is consistent with the alignment transform output\r\n    by the tool, which also is from the source points before any\r\n    initial alignment and to the reference points.\r\n   * The translation vector was expressed incorrectly in the\r\n     North-East-Down coordinate system, that is now fixed.\r\n\r\n - dem_mosaic\r\n   * If the -o option value is specified as filename.tif, all mosaic will be\r\n     written to this exact file, rather than creating tiles. \r\n\r\n - point2dem \r\n   * Added the ability to apply a filter to the cloud points in each circular\r\n     neighborhood before gridding. In addition to the current weighted average\r\n     option, it supports min, max, mean, median, stddev, count, nmad,\r\n     and percentile filters. The --search-radius-factor parameter can\r\n     control the neighborhood size.\r\n   * Sped up hole-filling in ortho image generation. If this creates\r\n     more holes than before, it is suggested to relax all outlier filtering,\r\n     including via --remove-outliers-params, median filtering, and erosion. \r\n   * Added the option --orthoimage-hole-fill-extra-len to make hole-filling\r\n     more aggressive by first extrapolating the cloud.\r\n\r\n - datum_convert\r\n   * Rewrote the tool to depend on the Proj.4 HTDPGrids grid shift system.\r\n     This fixed some situations where the tool was not working such as WGS84/NAD83\r\n     conversions and also added support for datum realizations (versions).\r\n   * Vertical datum conversion is only supported in simple cases like D_MARS to MOLA.\r\n   * Even with HTDPGrids, datum support with the Proj.4 library is poor and will\r\n     hopefully be improved with future releases.  Until then try to get external\r\n     verification of results obtained with the datum_convert tool.\r\n\r\n - wv_correct\r\n   * Supports WV2 TDI = 32 in reverse scan direction.\r\n\r\n - Misc\r\n   * We now compile against USGS ISIS version 3.5.2.\r\n   * The tools mapproject, dem_mosaic, dg_mosaic, and wv_correct support\r\n     the --ot option, to round the output pixels to several types of\r\n     integer, reducing storage, but perhaps decreasing accuracy.\r\n   * The tools mapproject and image_calc support the --mo option to\r\n     add metadata to the geoheader in the format 'VAR1=VAL1 VAR2=VAL2',\r\n     etc.\r\n   * Handle properly in bundle_adjust, orbitviz, and stereo \r\n     with mapprojected images the case when, for RPC cameras,\r\n     these coefficients are stored in _RPC.TXT files.\r\n   * Support for web-based PROJ.4 strings, e.g., \r\n     point2dem --t_srs http://spatialreference.org/ref/iau2000/49900/\r\n   * Added --max-output-size option to point2dem to prevent against\r\n     creation of too large DEMs.\r\n   * Added image download option in hiedr2mosaic.py.\r\n   * Bugfix in cam2map4stereo.py when the longitude crosses 180 degrees.\r\n   * Added support for running sparse_disp with your own Python installation.\r\n   * Bugfix for image cropping with epipolar aligned images.\r\n   * The sfs tool supports the integrability constraint weight from Horn 1990.\r\n   * The software works with both Python 2 and 3. \r\n\r\n"}
