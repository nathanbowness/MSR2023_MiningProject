# Current Version: 5.1.1

     Important note:  Malwoverview does NOT submit samples to any endpoint by default, 
     so it respects possible Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). There're specific options
     that explicitly submit samples, but these options are explained in the help.


# ABOUT

Malwoverview.py is a first response tool for threat hunting, which performs an initial and quick 
triage of malware samples, URLs, IP addresses, domains, malware families, IOCs and hashes. Additionally,
Malwoverview is able to get dynamic and static behavior reports, submit and download samples
from several endpoints. In few words, it works as a client to main existing sandboxes. 

This tool aims to : 

1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group 
   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!
2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, 
   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. 
3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. 
4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. 
6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, URLHaus, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.
7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.
9. List last payloads from URLHaus. 
10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.
11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.
12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. 
13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and 
    ThreatCrowd. 
14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.
17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.
18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.
19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. 
21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and
    malware family. 
22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. 
23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. 
24. Gather threat hunting information from Malware Bazaar using different criteria. 
25. Gather IOC information from ThreatFox using different criteria. 
26. Gather threat hunting information from Triage using different criteria. 
27. Get evaluation to hashes from a given file against Virus Total. 
28. Submit large files (>= 32 MB) to Virus Total. 
29. Malwoverview uses Virus Total API v.3, so there isn't longer any option using v.2.
30. Retrieve different information from InQuest Labs and download samples from there.

# INSTALLATION 

This tool has been tested on REMnux, Ubuntu, Kali Linux and macOS only. Malwoverview 
can be installed by executing the following command:

      * pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 
      
      or...
      
      * python -m pip install -U malwoverview
      
      or...
      
      * git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview

If you are using macOS, so you should install libmagic before installing Malwoverview:

      * brew install libmagic
      * pip3.9 install -U malwoverview

To use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,
Alien Vault, Malpedia  and Triage into the .malwapi.conf configuration file 
(the default one at the home directory (/home/[username] or /root) -- if the file doesn't exist,
so you should create it) or you could create a custom configuration file and indicate it by 
using the -c option.

Nonetheless, starting on version 4.4.2, it isn't longer necessary to insert all APIs into .malwapi.conf
before using Malwoverview. Therefore, users can only insert few APIs and use the respective options 
to these APIs.

* A special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault 
website before using -n 1 option.

The .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory -- /home/[username] or /root) 
has the following format:

      [VIRUSTOTAL]
      VTAPI = 

      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]
      HAAPI = 

      [MALSHARE]
      MALSHAREAPI = 

      [HAUSSUBMIT]
      HAUSSUBMITAPI =

      [POLYSWARM]
      POLYAPI = 

      [ALIENVAULT]
      ALIENAPI = 

      [MALPEDIA]
      MALPEDIAAPI =

      [TRIAGE]
      TRIAGEAPI =

      [INQUEST]
      INQUESTAPI =


The APIs can be requested on the respective service websites:

01. Virus Total (community and paid API): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
02. Hybrid Analysis: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup
03. Malshare: https://malshare.com/doc.php
04. URLHaus: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#account 
05. Polyswarm: https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers
06. Alien Vault: https://otx.alienvault.com/api
07. Malpedia: It doesn't offer open registration, but you can request an user account 
    directly through Twitter (DM) or feedback e-email. The Malpedia Twitter 
    handle is @malpedia.
08. Malware Bazaar: It isn't necessary an API.
09. ThreatFox: It isn't necessary an API.
10. InQuest: https://labs.inquest.net/.
11. Triage: https://tria.ge/signup.
 
----------------------------------------------------
A special note about API requests to the MALPEDIA:
----------------------------------------------------

The service and acceptance is based on the community vetting. Thus, it's recommended 
you send a request for an API from your business e-mail address and NOT 
public/free one (Gmail, Outlook and so on). Additionally, it'd be great whether 
you provided further information about you (LinkedIn account, Twitter and so on) 
because it would make simpler to proof your identity, professional profile and 
legitimacy, so making quicker the approval of your request.  

-----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Additional explanation about Triage:
----------------------------------------------------

Every Triage operation is based on the Triage ID of each artifact, so you need to
use the "-x 1 -X \<attribute\>:\<value\>" to look for the correct ID of the artifact,
so use this ID information with the remaining Triage options (-x [2-7]) for getting 
further threat hunting information from Triage endpoint.

-----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Note about background color of the terminal:
----------------------------------------------------

Malwoverview has been written to produce outputs to 
dark background terminal. However, there's the -o 0 
option, which changes and adapts output's colors to 
light background.

-----------------------------------------------------

On Linux and MacOS systems, create the .malwapi.conf file within
/home/\[username\] directory (Linux home user directory -- /home/[username] or /root).

To check the installation, execute:

       malwoverview.py --help
       
Further information is available on: 

       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/
       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview

If you want to perform the manual steps (usually, it is not necessary), so few steps 
should be executed:

## REMnux / Ubuntu (manual steps)

1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) 

       $ apt-get install python3.9  (for example)

2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       $ pip3.9 install python-magic

      Or compiling it from the github repository:

       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       $ cd python-magic/
       $ python3.9 setup.py build
       $ python3.9 setup.py install

      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my 
      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py 
      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. 
      
3. Install several Python packages: 

       $ pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt

       OR

       $ pip3.9 install -U pefile
       $ pip3.9 install -U colorama
       $ pip3.9 install -U simplejson
       $ pip3.9 install -U python-magic
       $ pip3.9 install -U requests
       $ pip3.9 install -U validators
       $ pip3.9 install -U geocoder
       $ pip3.9 install -U polyswarm-api
       $ pip3.9 install -U pathlib
       $ pip3.9 install -U configparser

4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the "adb" program by executing the following command:

       # apt get install adb

   PS: before trying Android's options, check:

       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.
       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using "adb devices -l"
