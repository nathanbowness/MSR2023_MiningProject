Should eliminate some errors with not being able to find Xvfb\n- More informative error messages\n- Detect situation when Xvfb can\u2019t listen to any sockets and raise corresponding error.\n- If video recorder provider is libav, use avconv binary instead of ffmpeg\n- Fixes to video recorder launch options (from @gpavlidi, @abotalov, @ynagorny, @WeAreFarmGeek)\n- Customize launch timeout (from @ShockwaveNN)\n- Properly working integration tests\n"}
