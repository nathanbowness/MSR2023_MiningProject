PySAT: SAT technology in Python
===============================

PySAT is a Python (2.7, 3.4+) toolkit, which aims at providing a simple and
unified interface to a number of state-of-art `Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem>`__ solvers as
well as to a variety of cardinality and pseudo-Boolean encodings. The purpose
of PySAT is to enable researchers working on SAT and its applications and
generalizations to easily prototype with SAT oracles in Python while
exploiting incrementally the power of the original low-level implementations
of modern SAT solvers.

PySAT can be helpful when solving problems in `NP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)>`__ but also `beyond NP
<http://beyondnp.org/>`__. For instance, PySAT is handy when one needs to
quickly implement a MaxSAT solver, an MUS/MCS extractor or enumerator, an
abstraction-based QBF solver, or any other kind of tool solving an application
problem with the (potentially *multiple* and/or *incremental*) use of a SAT
oracle.

Features
--------

PySAT integrates a number of widely used state-of-the-art SAT solvers. All the
provided solvers are the original low-level implementations installed along
with PySAT. Note that the solvers' source code *is not* a part of the
project's source tree and is downloaded and patched at every PySAT
installation. Note that originally the solvers' source code was not
distributed with PySAT, which resulted in sequence of download and patch
operations for each solver during each installation of PySAT. This, however,
causes serious issues in case of using a proxy. As a result and since version
0.1.6.dev1, PySAT includes the solvers' archive files in the distribution.

Currently, the following SAT solvers are supported (at this point, for
Minisat-based solvers only *core* versions are integrated):

-  CaDiCaL (`rel-1.0.3 <https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical>`__)
-  Glucose (`3.0 <http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/>`__)
-  Glucose (`4.1 <http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/>`__)
-  Lingeling (`bbc-9230380-160707 <http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/>`__)
-  MapleLCMDistChronoBT (`SAT competition 2018 version <http://sat2018.forsyte.tuwien.ac.at/solvers/main_and_glucose_hack/>`__)
-  MapleCM (`SAT competition 2018 version <http://sat2018.forsyte.tuwien.ac.at/solvers/main_and_glucose_hack/>`__)
-  Maplesat (`MapleCOMSPS_LRB <https://sites.google.com/a/gsd.uwaterloo.ca/maplesat/>`__)
-  Minicard (`1.2 <https://github.com/liffiton/minicard>`__)
-  Minisat (`2.2 release <http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html>`__)
-  Minisat (`GitHub version <https://github.com/niklasso/minisat>`__)

In order to make SAT-based prototyping easier, PySAT integrates a variety of
cardinality encodings. All of them are implemented from scratch in C++. The
list of cardinality encodings included is the following:

-  pairwise [8]_
-  bitwise [8]_
-  sequential counters [9]_
-  sorting networks [4]_
-  cardinality networks [2]_
-  ladder/regular [1]_ [5]_
-  totalizer [3]_
-  modulo totalizer [7]_
-  iterative totalizer [6]_

Furthermore, PySAT supports a number of encodings of pseudo-Boolean
constraints listed below. This is done by exploiting a third-party library
`PyPBLib <https://pypi.org/project/pypblib/>`__  developed by the `Logic

Usage
-----

Boolean variables in PySAT are represented as natural identifiers, e.g. numbers
from :math:`\mathbb{N}_{>0}`. A *literal* in PySAT is assumed to be an integer,
e.g. ``-1`` represents a literal :math:`\neg{x_1}` while :math:`5` represents a
literal :math:`x_5`.  A *clause* is a list of literals, e.g. ``[-3, -2]`` is a
clause :math:`(\neg{x_3} \vee \neg{x_2})`.

The following is a trivial example of PySAT usage:

.. code:: python

    >>> from pysat.solvers import Glucose3
    >>>
    >>> g = Glucose3()
    >>> g.add_clause([-1, 2])
    >>> g.add_clause([-2, 3])
    >>> print(g.solve())
    >>> print(g.get_model())
    ...
    True
    [-1, -2, -3]

Another example shows how to extract *unsatisfiable cores* from a SAT
solver given an unsatisfiable set of clauses:

.. code:: python

    >>> from pysat.solvers import Minisat22
    >>>
    >>> with Minisat22(bootstrap_with=[[-1, 2], [-2, 3]]) as m:
    ...     print(m.solve(assumptions=[1, -3]))
    ...     print(m.get_core())
    ...
    False
    [-3, 1]

Finally, the following example gives an idea of how one can extract a
*proof* (supported by Glucose3, Glucose4, and Lingeling only):

.. code:: python

    >>> from pysat.formula import CNF
    >>> from pysat.solvers import Lingeling
    >>>
    >>> formula = CNF()
    >>> formula.append([-1, 2])
    >>> formula.append([1, -2])
    >>> formula.append([-1, -2])
    >>> formula.append([1, 2])
    >>>
    >>> with Lingeling(bootstrap_with=formula.clauses, with_proof=True) as l:
    ...     if l.solve() == False:
    ...         print(l.get_proof())
    ...
    ['2 0', '1 0', '0']

PySAT usage is detailed in the `provided examples
<https://github.com/pysathq/pysat/tree/master/examples>`__. For instance, one
can find simple PySAT-based implementations of

-  Fu&Malik algorithm for MaxSAT [15]_
-  RC2/OLLITI algorithm for MaxSAT [19]_ [20]_
-  CLD-like algorithm for MCS extraction and enumeration [17]_
-  LBX-like algorithm for MCS extraction and enumeration [18]_
-  Deletion-based MUS extraction [16]_

The examples are installed with PySAT as a subpackage and, thus, they can be
accessed internally in Python:

.. code:: python

    >>> from pysat.formula import CNF
    >>> from pysat.examples.lbx import LBX
    >>>
    >>> formula = CNF(from_file='input.cnf')
    >>> mcsls = LBX(formula)
    >>>
    >>> for mcs in mcsls.enumerate():
    ...     print(mcs)

Alternatively, they can be used as standalone executables, e.g. like this:

::

   $ lbx.py -e all -d -s g4 -v another-input.wcnf

Installation
------------

There are several ways to install PySAT. At this point, either way assumes you
are using a POSIX-compliant operating system with GNU `make
<https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__ and `patch
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/>`__ installed and available from the
command line. Installation also relies on a C/C++ compiler supporting C++11,
e.g. `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`__ or `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`__, as
well as the ``six`` `Python package <https://pypi.org/project/six/>`__.
Finally, in order to compile "C extensions" included as modules, the installer
requires the headers of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ and `zlib
<https://www.zlib.net/>`__. Both can be installed using the standard package
repositories.

Note that although version `0.1.5.dev1` of PySAT brings Microsoft Windows
support, the toolkit was not extensively tested on this system. If you find
out that something is broken on Windows, please, `let us know
<https://github.com/pysathq/pysat/issues>`__. Your input is important.

Also note that using Clang is preferred on MacOS as there may be an issue with
GCC *being unaware of* the command-line option ``--stdlib=libc++``. Clang is
available on MacOS by default. To enforce the installer to use it, you need to
set the environment variable ``CC`` to ``/usr/bin/clang``. For that, do
``export CC=/usr/bin/clang`` if using Bash, or ``setenv CC /usr/bin/clang`` if
using tsch. *This is not needed on Linux!*

Once all the prerequisites are installed, the simplest way to get and start
using PySAT is to install the latest stable release of the toolkit from `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/>`__:

::

    $ pip install python-sat[pblib,aiger]

We encourage you to install the *optional* dependencies `pblib` and `aiger`,
as in the previous command. However, if it cannot be done (e.g. if their
installation fails), you can install PySAT with the functionality of `aiger`
and `pblib` disabled:

::

    $ pip install python-sat

Once installed from PyPI, the toolkit at a later stage can be updated in the
following way:

::

    $ pip install -U python-sat

Alternatively, one can clone `the repository
<https://github.com/pysathq/pysat>`__ and execute the following command in the
local copy:

::

    $ python setup.py install

This will install the toolkit into the system's Python path. If another
destination directory is preferred, it can be set by

::

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=<where-to-install>

Both options (i.e. via ``pip`` or ``setup.py``) are supposed to download
and compile all the supported SAT solvers as well as prepare the
installation of PySAT.

To-Do
-----

PySAT toolkit is a work in progress. Although it can already be helpful in many
practical settings (and it **was** successfully applied by its authors for a
number of times), it would be great if some of the following additional
features were implemented:

-  more SAT solvers to support (e.g. `CryptoMiniSat
   <https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/>`__, `RISS
   <http://tools.computational-logic.org/content/riss.php>`__ among many
   others)

-  formula *(pre-)processing*

-  lower level access to some of the solvers' internal parameters
   (e.g. *variable activities*, etc.)

-  high-level support for arbitrary Boolean formulas (e.g. by Tseitin-encoding
   [21]_ them internally)

All of these will require a significant effort to be made. Therefore, we would
like to encourage the SAT community to contribute and make PySAT a tool for an
easy and comfortable day-to-day use. :)
