The feature is available by invoking the `SetTimeout` method on a `ServerDispatcher`\r\n- Added support for disabling message validation entirely, via the `SetMessageValidation` package function\r\n- Added support for verbose logging (using an optional `logging.Logger`)\r\n\r\n## Websockets\r\n\r\n- Added a `RemoteAddr` function to websockets for retrieving the address of the remote host\r\n- Added support for disabling ping/pong mechanism, by setting `PingWait = 0` within the timeout configuration\r\n- Added support for verbose logging (using an optional `logging.Logger`)\r\n\r\n## Generic\r\n\r\n- Moved logging interfaces to a dedicated `ocpp-go/logging` package\r\n\r\n# Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug that occurred when sending messages over a closed websocket channel\r\n- Fixed a bug that would deadlock a newly created websocket, if the `NewClientHandler` callback contained blocking code\r\n- Fixed several other race conditions in the ocpp-j layer\r\n- Fixed a crash caused by incoming empty json requests/responses\r\n- Fixed a crash caused by incoming OCCP errors not containing a description field\r\n- Fixed the default subprotocol for v2 to be `ocpp2.0.1`", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/lorenzodonini/ocpp-go/releases/72673696/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

This fixes omissions of empty strings in `GetConfiguration` messages\r\n\r\nAll implementations will work as before, but the method signatures have slightly changed and will need to be updated. Please refer to the [updated example](https://github.com/lorenzodonini/ocpp-go/tree/master/example/1.6/cs) or refer to a748928291f86a98a3c91f4d34803adde42e2ec3 for updating your implementation.\r\n\r\n# Additions and improvements\r\n\r\n## Websocket\r\n\r\n- Added an `Addr` method to the websocket server for retrieving the listening address\r\n- Added a `StopConnection` function on the websocket server, to close a single existing connection\r\n- Added a graceful shutdown mechanism on the websocket server, which now sends a close message to every open connection\r\n- Charge point IDs now contain only the ID, stripping any prefix from the path\r\n- Subprotocols are now correctly handled and enforced by the server, \r\n- New connections with unsupported subprotocol now get closed only after completing the handshake\r\n\r\n## Generic\r\n\r\n- Added missing OCPP 2.0.1 features (examples and documentation still WIP)\r\n- Improved OCPP error messages\r\n- An `InternalError` is now sent, instead of a `ProtocolError`, when sending errors as a message response\r\n- Improved `ClientDispatcher.SendRequest` signature\r\n\r\n# Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed several race conditions causing hanging and other issues when closing/restarting connections\r\n- Fixed some field constraints that were too restrictive in:\r\n    - RemoteStopTransaction\r\n    - StartTransaction\r\n    - StopTransaction\r\n    - CancelReservation\r\n    - ReserveNow\r\n    - ClearChargingProfile\r\n- Fixed panics when attempting to parse unknown responses\r\n- New connections with the same ID no longer override previous connections but are closed immediately with a `PolicyViolation` error instead"}
