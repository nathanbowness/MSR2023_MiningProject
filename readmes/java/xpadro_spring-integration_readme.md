# spring-integration
Samples of different Spring Integration modules (jms, batch, integration). These modules are split into the following sections:

* [HTTP] - Processing of messages over HTTP.

* [WEB SERVICES] - Examples using Spring Integration Web Services support.

* [MONGO DB] - Integration with a MongoDB database.

* [RMI] - Processing of messages over RMI.

* [SPRING JMS] - Although not a direct part of the Spring Integration project, it is included in the certification guide. For this reason, it is appropriate to include this module in this repository.

* [FILE] - Support for file processing.

* [GENERIC] - Generic examples which are not specific to any of the previous sections.

Inside each section there is another readme file with a list of all related project examples. Some of them have a link to a blog entry explaining in detail how its components work.
