This has been fixed as part of a larger overhaul of path handling support in the west.manifest [API](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/west-apis.html#west-apis) module.\r\n\r\n    The west.Manifest.ManifestProject.__repr__ return value was fixed\r\n\r\nAPI changes:\r\n\r\n    west.configuration.Configuration: new object-oriented interface to the current configuration. This reflects the system, global, and workspace-local configuration values, and allows you to read, write, and delete configuration options from any or all of these locations.\r\n\r\n    west.commands.WestCommand:\r\n\r\n        config: new attribute, returns a Configuration object or aborts the program if none is set. This is always usable from within extension command do_run() implementations.\r\n\r\n        has_config: new boolean attribute, which is True if and only if reading self.config will abort the program.\r\n\r\n    The path handling in the west.manifest package has been overhauled in a backwards-incompatible way. For more details, see commit [56cfe8d1d1](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/west/commit/56cfe8d1d1f3c9b45de3e793c738acd62db52aca).\r\n\r\n    west.manifest.Manifest.validate(): this now returns the validated data as a Python dict. This can be useful if the value passed to this function was a str, and the dict is desired.\r\n\r\n    west.manifest.Manifest: new:\r\n\r\n        path attributes abspath, posixpath, relative_path, yaml_path, repo_path, repo_posixpath\r\n\r\n        userdata attribute, which contains the parsed value from manifest: self: userdata:, or is None\r\n\r\n        from_topdir() factory method\r\n\r\n    west.manifest.ManifestProject: new userdata attribute, which also contains the parsed value from manifest: self: userdata:, or is None\r\n\r\n    west.manifest.ManifestImportFailed: the constructor can now take any value; this can be used to reflect failed imports from a [map](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/manifest.html#west-manifest-import-map) or other compound value.\r\n\r\n    Deprecated configuration APIs:\r\n\r\n    The following APIs are now deprecated in favor of using a Configuration object. Usually this will be done via self.config from a WestCommand instance, but this can be done directly by instantiating a Configuration object for other usages.\r\n\r\n        west.configuration.config\r\n\r\n        west.configuration.read_config\r\n\r\n        west.configuration.update_config\r\n\r\n        west.configuration.delete_config\r\n```"}

These invalid characters are\r\n  now rejected.\r\n\r\n  Note: if you need to place a project within a subdirectory of the workspace\r\n  topdir, use the 'path:' key. If you need to customize a project's fetch URL\r\n  relative to its remote 'url-base:', use 'repo-path:'.\r\n\r\n- The changes made in west v0.10.1 to the 'west init --manifest-rev' option\r\n  which selected the default branch name were leaving the manifest repository\r\n  in a detached HEAD state. This has been fixed by using 'git clone' internally\r\n  instead of 'git init' and 'git fetch'. See issue #522 for details.\r\n\r\n- The WEST_CONFIG_LOCAL environment variable now correctly\r\n  overrides the default location, <workspace topdir>/.west/config.\r\n\r\n- west update --fetch=smart (smart is the default) now correclty skips\r\n  fetches for project revisions which are lightweight tags (it already\r\n  worked correctly for annotated tags; only lightweight tags were unnecessarily\r\n  fetched).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- The fix for issue #522 mentioned above introduces a new restriction. The\r\n  west init --manifest-rev option value, if given, must now be either a\r\n  branch or a tag. In particular, \"pseudo-branches\" like GitHub's\r\n  pull/1234/head references which could previously be used to fetch a pull\r\n  request can no longer be passed to --manifest-rev. Users must now fetch\r\n  and check out such revisions manually after running west init.\r\n\r\nAPI changes:\r\n\r\n- west.manifest.Manifest.get_projects() avoids incorrect results in\r\n  some edge cases described in issue #523.\r\n\r\n- west.manifest.Project.sha() now works correctly for tag revisions.\r\n  (This applies to both lightweight and annotated tags.)"}
