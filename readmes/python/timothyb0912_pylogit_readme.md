# PyLogit
PyLogit is a Python package for performing maximum likelihood estimation of conditional logit models and similar discrete choice models.

## Main Features
- It supports
   - Conditional Logit (Type) Models
     - Multinomial Logit Models
     - Multinomial Asymmetric Models
        - Multinomial Clog-log Model
        - Multinomial Scobit Model
        - Multinomial Uneven Logit Model
        - Multinomial Asymmetric Logit Model
   - Nested Logit Models
   - Mixed Logit Models (with Normal mixing distributions)
- It supports datasets where the choice set differs across observations
- It supports model specifications where the coefficient for a given variable may be
   - completely alternative-specific   
   (i.e. one coefficient per alternative, subject to identification of the coefficients),
   - subset-specific  
   (i.e. one coefficient per subset of alternatives, where each alternative belongs to only one subset, and there are more than 1 but less than J subsets, where J is the maximum number of available alternatives in the dataset),
   - completely generic  
   (i.e. one coefficient across all alternatives).
