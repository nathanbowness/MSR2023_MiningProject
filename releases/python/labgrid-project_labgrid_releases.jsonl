The functions have been integrated into the\r\n  labgridhelper library, please use the library for the old functionality.\r\n- labgrid-client ``write-image`` subcommand: labgrid client now has a\r\n  ``write-image`` command to write images onto block devices.\r\n- ``labgrid-client ssh`` now also uses port from NetworkService resource if\r\n  available\r\n- The ``PLACE`` and ``STATE`` variables used by labgrid-client are replaced by\r\n  ``LG_PLACE`` and ``LG_STATE``, the old variables are still supported for the\r\n  time being.\r\n- The SSHDriver's keyfile attribute is now specified relative to the config\r\n  file just like the images are.\r\n- The ShellDriver's keyfile attribute is now specified relative to the config\r\n  file just like the images are.\r\n- ``labgrid-client -P <PROXY>`` and the ``LG_PROXY`` enviroment variable can be\r\n  used to access the coordinator and network resources via that SSH proxy host.\r\n  Drivers which run commands via SSH to the exporter still connect directly,\r\n  allowing custom configuration in the user's ``.ssh/config`` as needed.\r\n  Note that not all drivers have been updated to use the ProxyManager yet.\r\n- Deditec RELAIS8 devices are now supported by the `DeditecRelaisDriver`.\r\n- The `RKUSBDriver` was added to support the rockchip serial download mode.\r\n- The `USBStorageDriver` gained support for BMAP.\r\n- Flashrom support added, by hard-wiring e.g. an exporter to the DUT, the ROM\r\n  on the DUT can be written directly. The flashrom driver implements the\r\n  bootstrap protocol.\r\n- AndroidFastbootDriver now supports 'getvar' and 'oem getenv' subcommands.\r\n- The coordinator now updates the resource acquired state at the exporter.\r\n  Accordingly, the exporter now starts ser2net only when a resources is\r\n  aquired. Furthermore, resource conflicts between places are now detected.\r\n- Labgrid now uses the `ProcessWrapper` for externally called processes. This\r\n  should include output from these calls better inside the test runs.\r\n- The binding dictionary can now supports type name strings in addition to the\r\n  types themselves, avoiding the need to import a specific protocol or driver\r\n  in some cases.\r\n- The remote infrastructure gained support for place reservations, for further\r\n  information check the section in the documentation.\r\n- The `SigrokDriver` gained support for the Manson HCS-2302, it allows enabling\r\n  and disabling channels, measurement and setting the current and voltage limit.\r\n- ``labgrid-client write-image`` gained new arguments: ``--partition``,\r\n  ``--skip``, ``--seek``.\r\n- Support for Sentry PDUs has been added.\r\n- Strategies now implement a ``force`` method, to ``force`` a strategy state\r\n  irrespective of the current state.\r\n- SSH Connections can now be proxied over the exporter, used by adding a device\r\n  suffix to the `NetworkService` address.\r\n- UBootDriver now allows overriding of default boot command (``run bootcmd``)\r\n  via new ``boot_command`` argument.\r\n- The config file supports per-target options, in addition to global options.\r\n- Add power driver to support GEMBIRD SiS-PM implementing SiSPMPowerDriver.\r\n- A cleanup of the cleanup functions was performed, labgrid should now clean up\r\n  after itself and throws an error if the user needs to handle it himself.\r\n- ``labgrid-client`` now respects the ``LG_HOSTNAME`` and ``LG_USERNAME``\r\n  environment variables to set the hostname and username when accessing\r\n  resources.\r\n- PyVISA support added, allowing to use PyVISA controlled test equipment from\r\n  Labgrid.\r\n- ``labgrid-client write-image`` gained a new argument ``--mode`` to specify\r\n  which tool should be used to write the image (either ``dd`` or ``bmaptool``)\r\n- Exporter configuration file ``exporter.yaml`` now allows use of environment\r\n  variables.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes in 0.3.0\r\n\r\n- `ManagedFile` now saves the files in a different directory on the exporter.\r\n  Previously ``/tmp`` was used, labgrid now uses ``/var/cache/labgrid``.\r\n  A tmpfiles example configuration for systemd is provided in the ``/contrib``\r\n  directory.\r\n  It is also highly recommended to enable ``fs.protected_regular=1`` and\r\n  ``fs.protected_fifos=1`` for kernels>=4.19.\r\n  This requires user intervention after the upgrade to create the directory and\r\n  setup the cleanup job.\r\n- ``@attr.s(cmp=False)`` is deprecated and all classes have been moved to\r\n  ``@attr.s(eq=False)``, this release requires attrs version 19.2.0\r\n- Coordinator work dir is now set to the same dir as the crossbar configuration\r\n  dir. Hence coordinator specific files like ``places.yaml`` and\r\n  ``resources.yaml`` are now also stored in the crossbar configuration folder.\r\n  Previously it would use ``..``.\r\n- The ``HawkbitTestClient`` and ``USBStick`` classes have been removed\r\n- The original USBStorageDriver was removed, ``NetworkUSBStorageDriver`` was\r\n  renamed to `USBStorageDriver`.\r\n  A deprecated `NetworkUSBStorageDriver` exists temporarily for compatibility\r\n  reasons.\r\n\r\n# Known issues in 0.3.0\r\n\r\n- There are several reports of ``sshpass`` used within the SSHDriver not working\r\n  in call cases or only on the first connection.\r\n- Some client commands return 0 even if the command failed.\r\n- Currently empty passwords are not well supported by the ShellDriver"}
