Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) Workflow is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that adds a developer-friendly layer to any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers.

We welcome your input! If you have feedback, please submit an [issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and submit a [pull request][prs].

# About

The Deis router handles ingress and routing of HTTP/S traffic bound for the Deis Workflow controller (API) and for your own applications. This component is 100% Kubernetes native and, while it's intended for use with the Deis Workflow [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), it's flexible enough to be used standalone inside any Kubernetes cluster.

# Development

The Deis project welcomes contributions from all developers. The high level process for development matches many other open source projects. See below for an outline.

* Fork this repository
* Make your changes
* Submit a [pull request][prs] (PR) to this repository with your changes, and unit tests whenever possible.
	* If your PR fixes any [issues][issues], make sure you write Fixes #1234 in your PR description (where #1234 is the number of the issue you're closing)
* The Deis core contributors will review your code. After each of them sign off on your code, they'll label your PR with `LGTM1` and `LGTM2` (respectively). Once that happens, they'll merge it.

## Installation

This section documents simple procedures for installing the Deis Router for evaluation or use.  Those wishing to contribute to Deis Router development might consider the more developer-oriented instructions in the [Hacking Router](#hacking) section.

Deis Router can be installed with or without the rest of the Deis Workflow platform.  In either case, begin with a healthy Kubernetes cluster.  Kubernetes getting started documentation is available [here](http://kubernetes.io/gettingstarted/).

Next, install the [Helm](http://helm.sh) package manager, then use the commands below to initialize that tool and install all of Deis Workflow or the Deis Router by itself.

```
$ helm init
```

To install all of Deis Workflow:

```
$ helm repo add workflow https://charts.deis.com/workflow
$ helm install workflow/workflow --namespace deis
```

Or to install the Deis Router by itself:

```
$ helm repo add router https://charts.deis.com/router
$ helm install router/router --namespace deis
```

For next steps, skip ahead to the [How it Works](#how-it-works) and [Configuration Guide](#configuration) sections.

## <a name="hacking"></a>Hacking Router

The only dependencies for hacking on / contributing to this component are:

* `git`
* `make`
* `docker`
* `kubectl`, properly configured to manipulate a healthy Kubernetes cluster that you presumably use for development
* Your favorite text editor

Although the router is written in Go, you do _not_ need Go or any other development tools installed.  Any parts of the developer workflow requiring tools not listed above are delegated to a containerized Go development environment.

### Registry

The following sections setup, build, deploy, and test the Deis Router. You'll need a configured Docker registry to push changed images to so that they can be deployed to your Kubernetes cluster. You can easily make use of a public registry such as [hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com), provided you have an account. To do so:

```
$ export DEIS_REGISTRY=registry.hub.docker.com/
$ export IMAGE_PREFIX=your-username
```

### If I can `make` it there, I'll `make` it anywhere...

The entire developer workflow for anyone hacking on the router is implemented as a set of `make` targets.  They are simple and easy to use, and collectively provide a workflow that should feel familiar to anyone who has hacked on Deis v1.x in the past.

#### Setup:

To "vendor" the development environment:

```
$ make vendor
```

In router's case, this step carries out some extensive dependency management using go modules within the containerized development environment.  Because the router leverages the Kubernetes API, which in turn has in excess of one hundred dependencies, this step can take quite some time.  __Be patient, and allow up to 20 minutes.  You generally only ever have to do this once.__


#### To build:

```
$ make build
```

Make sure to have defined the variable `DEIS_REGISTRY` previous to this step, as your image tags will be prefixed according to this.

#### To deploy:

```
$ make deploy
```

The deploy target will implicitly build first, then push the built image to your development registry (i.e. that specified by `DEIS_REGISTRY`).  The router's _existing_ Kubernetes `Deployment` (installed via Helm) will be updated to use the newly built image.

To see that the router is running, you can look for its pod(s):

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=deis
```

## Trying it Out

To deploy some sample routable applications:

```
$ helm install charts/examples --namespace router-examples
```

This will deploy Nginx and Apache to your Kubernetes cluster as if they were user applications.

To test, first modify your `/etc/hosts` such that the following four hostnames are resolvable to the IP of the Kubernetes node that is hosting the router:

* nginx.example.com
* apache.example.com
* httpd.example.com
* unknown.example.com

By requesting the following three URLs from your browser, you should find that one is routed to a pod running Nginx, while the other two are routed to a pod running Apache:

* http://nginx.example.com
* http://apache.example.com
* http://httpd.example.com

Requesting http://unknown.example.com should result in a 404 from the router since no route exists for that domain name.

## <a name="how-it-works"></a>How it Works

The router is implemented as a simple Go program that manages Nginx and Nginx configuration.  It regularly queries the Kubernetes API for services labeled with `router.deis.io/routable: "true"`.  Such services are compared to known services resident in memory.  If there are differences, new Nginx configuration is generated and Nginx is reloaded.

__Routable services must expose port 80.__ The target port in underlying pods may be anything, but the service itself must expose port 80. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: foo
  labels:
  	router.deis.io/routable: "true"
  namespace: router-examples
  annotations:
    router.deis.io/domains: www.foobar.com
  spec:
    selector:
      app: foo
    ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
# ...
```

When generating configuration, the program reads all annotations of each service prefixed with `router.deis.io`.  These annotations describe all the configuration options that allow the program to dynamically construct Nginx configuration, including virtual hosts for all the domain names associated with each routable application.

Similarly, the router watches the annotations on its _own_ deployment object to dynamically construct global Nginx configuration.

## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration Guide

### Environment variables

Router configuration is driven almost entirely by annotations on the router's deployment object and the services of all routable applications-- those labeled with `router.deis.io/routable: "true"`.

One exception to this, however, is that in order for the router to discover its own annotations, the router must be configured via environment variable with some awareness of its own namespace.  (It cannot query the API for information about itself without knowing this.)

The `POD_NAMESPACE` environment variable is required by the router and it should be configured to match the Kubernetes namespace that the router is deployed into.  If no value is provided, the router will assume a value of `default`.

For example, consider the following Kubernetes manifest.  Given a manifest containing the following metadata:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deis-router
  namespace: deis
# ...
```

The corresponding template must inject a `POD_NAMESPACE=deis` environment variable into router containers.  The most elegant way to achieve this is by means of the Kubernetes "downward API," as in this snippet from the same manifest:

```
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: deis-router
        # ...
        env:
        - name: POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
# ...
```

Altering the value of the `POD_NAMESPACE` environment variable requires the router to be restarted for changes to take effect.

### Annotations

All remaining options are configured through annotations.  Any of the following three Kubernetes resources can be configured:

| Resource | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| <ul><li>deis-router deployment object</li><li>deis-builder service (if in use)</li></ul> | All of these configuration options are specific to _this_ implementation of the router (as indicated by the inclusion of the token `nginx` in the annotations' names).  Customized and alternative router implementations are possible.  Such routers are under no obligation to honor these annotations, as many or all of these may not be applicable in such scenarios.  Customized and alternative implementations _should_ document their own configuration options. |
| <ul><li>routable application services</li></ul> | These are services labeled with `router.deis.io/routable: "true"`.  In the context of the broader Deis Workflow PaaS, these annotations are _written_ by the Deis Workflow controller component (the API).  These annotations, therefore, represent the contract or _interface_ between that component and the router.  As such, any customized or alternative router implementations that wishes to remain compatible with deis-controller must honor (or ignore) these annotations, but may _not_ alter their names or redefine their meanings. |

The table below details the configuration options that are available for each of the above.

_Note that Kubernetes annotation maps are all of Go type `map[string]string`.  As such, all configuration values must also be strings.  To avoid Kubernetes attempting to populate the `map[string]string` with non-string values, all numeric and boolean configuration values should be enclosed in double quotes to help avoid confusion._

| <a name="platform-domain"></a>deis-router | deployment | [router.deis.io/nginx.platformDomain](#platform-domain) | N/A | This defines the router's platform domain.  Any domains added to a routable application _not_ containing the `.` character will be assumed to be subdomains of this platform domain.  Thus, for example, a platform domain of `example.com` coupled with a routable app counting `foo` among its domains will result in router configuration that routes traffic for `foo.example.com` to that application. |
| <a name="use-proxy-protocol"></a>deis-router | deployment | [router.deis.io/nginx.useProxyProtocol](#use-proxy-protocol) | `"false"` | PROXY is a simple protocol supported by nginx, HAProxy, Amazon ELB, and others.  It provides a method to obtain information about a request's originating IP address from an external (to Kubernetes) load balancer in front of the router.  Enabling this option allows the router to select the originating IP from the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header. |

The rule set that Modsecurity will use by default is the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs) and Modsecurity will be turned on to block malicious traffic on all apps if this annotation is enabled.  This core rule set can be overwritten by configMap and mounted as a volumeMount.  |

| <a name="default-service-enabled"></a>deis-router | deployment | [router.deis.io/nginx.defaultServiceEnabled](#default-service-enabled) | `"false"` | Enables default back-end service for traffic hitting /. In order to work correctly both `defaultServiceIP` and `DefaultAppName` MUST also be set.  |
| <a name="default-app-name"></a>deis-router | deployment | [router.deis.io/nginx.DefaultAppName](#default-app-name) | `""` | Default back-end application name for traffic hitting router on /. In order to work correctly both `defaultServiceIP` and `DefaultServiceEnabled` MUST also be set.  |
| <a name="default-service-ip"></a>deis-router | deployment | [router.deis.io/nginx.defaultServiceIP](#default-service-ip) | `""` | Default back-end service ip for traffic hitting router on /. In order to work correctly both `DefaultAppName` and `DefaultServiceEnabled` MUST also be set. |

### <a name="ssl"></a>SSL

Router has support for HTTPS with the ability to perform SSL termination using certificates supplied via Kubernetes secrets.  Just as router utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover routable services, router also uses the API to discover cert-bearing secrets.  This allows the router to dynamically refresh and reload configuration whenever such a certificate is added, updated, or removed.  There is never a need to explicitly restart the router.

A certificate may be supplied in the manner described above and can be used to provide a secure virtual host (in addition to the insecure virtual host) for any _fully-qualified domain name_ associated with a routable service.

#### SSL example

Here is an example of a Kubernetes secret bearing a certificate for use with a specific fully-qualified domain name.  The following criteria must be met:

* Secret name must be for the form `<arbitrary name>-cert`
  * This must be associated to the domain using the [router.deis.io/certificates](#certificates) annotation.
* Must be in the same namespace as the routable service
* Certificate must be supplied as the value of the key `tls.crt`
* Certificate private key must be supplied as the value of the key `tls.key`
* Both the certificate and private key must be base64 encoded

For example, assuming a routable service exists in the namespace `cheery-yardbird` and is configured with `www.example.com` among its domains, like so:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: cheery-yardbird
  annotations:
    router.deis.io/domains: cheery-yardbird,www.example.com
    router.deis.io/certificates: www.example.com:www-example-com"
# ...
```

The corresponding cert-bearing secret would appear as follows:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: www-example-com-cert
  namespace: cheery-yardbird
type: Opaque
data:
  tls.crt: MT1...uDh==
  tls.key: MT1...MRp=
```

#### <a name="platform-cert"></a>Platform certificate

A wildcard certificate may be supplied in a manner similar to that described above and can be used as a platform certificate to provide a secure virtual host (in addition to the insecure virtual host) for _every_ "domain" of a routable service that is not a fully-qualified domain name.

For instance, if a routable service exists having a "domain" `frozen-wookie` and the router's platform domain is `example.com`, a supplied wildcard certificate for `*.example.com` will be used to secure a `frozen-wookie.example.com` virtual host.  Similarly, if no platform domain is defined, the supplied wildcard certificate will be used to secure a virtual host matching the expression `~^frozen-wookie\.(?<domain>.+)$`.  (The latter is almost certainly guaranteed to result in certificate warnings in an end user's browser, so it is advisable to always define the router's platform domain.)

If the same routable service also had a domain `www.frozen-wookie.com`, the `*.example.com` wildcard certificate plays no role in securing the `www.frozen-wookie.com` virtual host.

##### Platform certificate example

Here is an example of a Kubernetes secret bearing a wildcard certificate for use by the router.  The following criteria must be met:

* Namespace must be the same namespace as the router
* Name _must_ be `deis-router-platform-cert`
* Certificate must be supplied as the value of the key `tls.crt`
* Certificate private key must be supplied as the value of the key `tls.key`
* Both the certificate and private key must be base64 encoded

For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: deis-router-platform-cert
  namespace: deis
type: Opaque
data:
  tls.crt: LS0...tCg==
  tls.key: LS0...LQo=
```

#### SSL options

When combined with a good certificate, the router's _default_ SSL options are sufficient to earn an A grade from [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html).

Earning an A+ is as easy as simply enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security (see the `router.deis.io/nginx.ssl.hsts.enabled` option), but be aware that this will implicitly trigger the `router.deis.io/nginx.ssl.enforce` option and cause your applications to permanently use HTTPS for _all_ requests.

### Front-facing load balancer

Depending on what distribution of Kubernetes you use and where you host it, installation of the router _may_ automatically include an external (to Kubernetes) load balancer or similar mechanism for routing inbound traffic from beyond the cluster into the cluster to the router(s).  For example, [kube-aws](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/kubernetes-on-aws.html) and [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) both do this.  On some other platforms-- Vagrant or bare metal, for instance-- this must either be accomplished manually or does not apply at all.

#### Idle connection timeouts

If a load balancer such as the one described above does exist (whether created automatically or manually) _and_ if you intend on handling any long-running requests, the load balancer (or similar) _may_ require some manual configuration to increase the idle connection timeout.  Typically, this is most applicable to AWS and Elastic Load Balancers, but may apply in other cases as well.  It does _not_ apply to Google Container Engine, as the idle connection timeout cannot be configured there, but also works fine as-is.

If, for instance, router were installed on kube-aws, in conjunction with the rest of the Deis Workflow platform, this timeout should be increased to a recommended value of 1200 seconds.  This will ensure the load balancer does not hang up on the client during long-running operations like an application deployment.  Directions for this can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/config-idle-timeout.html).

#### Manually configuring a load balancer

If using a Kubernetes distribution or underlying infrastructure that does not support the automated provisioning of a front-facing load balancer, operators will wish to manually configure a load balancer (or use other tricks) to route inbound traffic from beyond the cluster _into_ the cluster to the platform's own router(s).  There are many ways to accomplish this.  The remainder of this section discusses three general options for accomplishing this.

##### Option 1

This manually replicates the configuration that would be achieved automatically with some distributions on some infrastructure providers, as discussed above.

First, determine the "node ports" for the `deis-router` service:

```
$ kubectl describe service deis-router --namespace=deis
```

This will yield output similar to the following:

```
...
Port:			http	80/TCP
NodePort:		http	32477/TCP
Endpoints:		10.2.80.11:80
Port:			https	443/TCP
NodePort:		https	32389/TCP
Endpoints:		10.2.80.11:443
Port:			builder	2222/TCP
NodePort:		builder	30729/TCP
Endpoints:		10.2.80.11:2222
Port:			healthz	9090/TCP
NodePort:		healthz	31061/TCP
Endpoints:		10.2.80.11:9090
...
```

The node ports shown above are high-numbered ports that are allocated on _every_ Kubernetes worker node for use by the router service.  The kube-proxy component on _every_ Kubernetes node will listen on these ports and proxy traffic through to the corresponding port within an "endpoint--" that is, a pod running the Deis router.

If manually creating a load balancer, configure the load balancer to have _all_ Kubernetes worker nodes in the back-end pool, and listen on ports 80, 443, and 2222 (port 9090 can be ignored).  Each of these listeners should proxy inbound traffic to the corresponding node ports on the worker nodes.  Ports 80 and 443 may use either HTTP/S or TCP as protocols.  Port 2222 must use TCP.

With this configuration, the path a request takes from the end-user to an application pod is as follows:

```
user agent (browser) --> front-facing load balancer --> kube-proxy on _any_ Kubernetes worker node --> _any_ Deis router pod --> kube-proxy on that same node --> _any_ application pod
```

##### Option 2

Option 2 differs only slightly from option 1, but is more efficient.  As such, even operators who had a front-facing load balancer automatically provisioned on their infrastructure by Kubernetes might consider manually reconfiguring that load balancer as follows.

Deis router pods will listen on _host_ ports 80, 443, 2222, and 9090 wherever they run.  (They will not run on any worker nodes where all of these four ports are not available.)  Taking advantage of this, an operator may completely dismiss the node ports discussed in option 1.  The load balancer can be configured to have _all_ Kubernetes worker nodes in the back-end pool, and listen on ports 80, 443, and 2222.  Each of these listeners should proxy inbound traffic to the _same_ ports on the worker nodes.  Ports 80 and 443 may use either HTTP/S or TCP as protocols.  Port 2222 must use TCP.

Additionally, a health check _must_ be configured using the HTTP protocol, port 9090, and the `/healthz` endpoint.  With such a health check in place, _only_ nodes that are actually hosting a router pods will pass and be included in the load balancer's pool of active back end instances.

With this configuration, the path a request takes from the end-user to an application pod is as follows:

```
user agent (browser) --> front-facing load balancer --> a Deis router pod --> kube-proxy on that same node --> _any_ application pod
```

##### Option 3

Option 3 is similar to option 2, but does not actually utilize a load balancer at all.  Instead, a DNS A record may be created that lists the public IP addresses of _all_ Kubernetes worker nodes.  This will leverage DNS round-robining to direct requests to all nodes.  To guarantee _all_ nodes can adequately route incoming traffic, the Deis router component should be scaled out by increasing the number of replicas specified in the deployment object to match the number of worker nodes.  Anti-affinity should ensure exactly one router pod runs per worker node.

__This configuration is not suitable for production.__ The primary use case for this configuration is demonstrating or evaluating Deis Workflow on bare metal Kubernetes clusters without incurring the effort to configure an _actual_ front-facing load balancer.

## Production Considerations

### Customizing the charts

The Helm [chart][] available for installing router (either with or without the rest of Deis Workflow) is intended to get users up and running as quickly as possible.  As such, the chart does not strictly require any editing prior to installation in order to successfully bootstrap a cluster.  However, there are some useful customizations that should be applied for use in production environments:

* __Specify a [platform domain](#platform-domain).__  Without a platform domain specified, any routable service specifying one or more non-fully-qualified domain names (not containing any `.` character) among its `router.deis.io/domains` will be matched using a regular expression of the form `^{{ $domain }}\.(?<domain>.+)$` where `{{ $domain }}` resolves to the non-fully-qualified domain name.  By way of example, the idiosyncrasy that this exposes is that traffic bound for the `foo` subdomain of _any_ domain would be routed to an application that lists the non-fully-qualified domain name `foo` among its `router.deis.io/domains`.  While this behavior is not innately wrong, it may not be desirable.  To circumvent this, specify a [platform domain](#platform-domain).  This will cause routable services specifying one or more non-fully-qualified domain names to be matched, explicitly, as subdomains of the platform domain.  Apart from remediating this minor idiosyncrasy, this is required in order to properly utilize a wildcard SSL certificate and may also result in a very modest performance improvement.

* __Do you need to use SSL to [secure the platform domain](#platform-cert)?__

* __If using SSL, generate and provide your own dhparam.__  A dhparam is a secret key used in [Diffie Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) during the SSL handshake in order to help ensure [perfect forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy).  The Helm [chart][] available for installing router (either with or without the rest of Deis Workflow) already includes a dhparam, but recall that dhparams are intended to be secret.  The dhparam included in the chart is marginally preferable to using Nginx's default dhparam only because it is lesser-known, but it is _still_ publicly available in the [chart][].  As such, users wishing to run the router in production _and_ use SSL are best off generating their own dhparam.  After being generated, it should be base64 encoded and included as the value of the `dhparam` key in a Kubernetes secret named `deis-router-dhparam` in the same namespace as the router itself.

  For example, to generate and base64 encode the dhparam on a Mac:

  ```
  $ openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 1024
  $ base64 dhparam.pem
  ```

  To generate an even stronger key, use 2048 bits, but note that generating such a key will take a very long time-- possibly hours.

  Include the base64 encoded dhparam in a secret:

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
      name: deis-router-dhparam
      namespace: deis
      labels:
        heritage: deis
  type: Opaque
  data:
      dhparam: <base64 encoded dhparam>
  ```

* __If using SSL, do you need to [_enforce_ the use of SSL](#ssl-enforce)?__

* __If using SSL, do you need to [enable strict transport security](#ssl-hsts-enabled)?__

* __If using SSL, what grade does [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) give you?__

* __Should your router [define and enforce a default whitelist](#enforce-whitelists)?__  This may be advisable for routers governing ingress to a cluster that hosts applications intended for a limited audience-- e.g. applications for internal use within an organization.

* __Do you need to scale the router?__ For greater availability, it's desirable to run more than one instance of the router.  _How many_ can only be informed by stress/performance testing the applications in your cluster.  To increase the number of router instances from the default of one, increase the number of replicas specified by the `deis-router` deployment object.  Do not specify a number of replicas greater than the number of worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  

  There are a few scaling concerns when it comes to running many instances of the router.  When there are many applications and services deployed, the router needs to query the k8s API for relevant metadata concerning itself and all routable services in order to generate the nginx config.  This takes longer as the number of application/services increases and the router pods could timeout on the health checks before the k8s API client populates the RouterConfig object inside the pod.  It may be necessary to increase the `initialDelaySeconds` timeout of `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` health checks of the `deis-router` deployment object at some point when reaching that scale.
