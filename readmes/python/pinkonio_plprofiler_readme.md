PL Profiler Extension
=====================

The **plprofiler** is an extension for the PostgreSQL database system to create performance profiles of PL/pgSQL functions and stored procedures. The included external Python class and command line utility can be used to easily control the extension, run arbitrary SQL commands (invoking PL/pgSQL functions), save and manage the resulting performance datasets and create HTML reports from them.

Overview
--------

Finding performance problems within PL/pgSQL functions and stored procedures can be difficult, especially when the code is nested. This is because PL/pgSQL creates a cloak over whatever is happening inside. The only thing visible in system or extension views, such as `pg_stat_activity` or `pg_stat_statements` is the query, sent from the client. In the case of invoking a stored procedure, that is just the outermost stored procedure call. 

The **plprofiler** extension can be used to quickly identify the most time consuming functions and then drill down to find the individual statements within them.

The output, generated by the **plprofiler**, is a self-contained HTML document. The document starts with a [FlameGraph](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html) at the top, followed by details about functions in the profile. Unlike usual CPU FlameGraphs, the **plprofiler** FlameGraph is based on the actual Wall-Clock time, spent in the PL/pgSQL functions. By default, the top ten functions, based on their self_time (total_time - children_time), are detailed. This can be overridden by the user.

#####Major Change History
* 2012 - Removed from PostgreSQL plDebugger Extension
* 2015 - Resurrected as standalone plProfiler by OpenSCG
* 2016 - Rewritten as v2 to use shared hash tables, have lower overhead
* 2016 - v3 Major performance improvements, flame graph UI
* 2019 - v3.5 Placed all extension objects under role plprofiler for easier grant
