For this\n  backend to work, be sure to download the file from gutenberg.org and\n  place it under \"~/.vim/thesaurus\".\n\nBy default, query will be performed by Online Query Backend first. Only when no\nsynonym is found from [Thesaurus.com](thesaurus.com), either due to the lack of\nInternet connection or the word is not included, the plugin will turn to the\nLocal Query Backend for further query. This query sequence can be reversed. For\ndetail, please refer to\n[documentation](https://github.com/Ron89/thesaurus_query.vim/blob/version0_1_0/doc/thesaurus_query.txt).\n\n# How to Install\n\nInstall using plugin managers is prefered. Use your plugin manager of choice:\n- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)\n  - `git clone https://github.com/ron89/thesaurus_query.vim ~/.vim/bundle/thesaurus_query.vim`\n- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)\n  - Add `Bundle 'ron89/thesaurus_query.vim '` to .vimrc\n  - Run `:BundleInstall`\n- [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)\n  - Add `NeoBundle 'ron89/thesaurus_query.vim'` to .vimrc\n  - Run `:NeoBundleInstall`\n- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)\n  - Add `Plug 'ron89/thesaurus_query.vim'` to .vimrc\n  - Run `:PlugInstall`\n\nThe Online Query Backend is functional by default. So without further\ncustomization, the plugin should be good to go. However, if user want the Local\nQuery Backend to be functional as well, some further steps might be needed.\n\n## Configure for Local Query Backend\n\nDownload `mthesaur.txt`(around 24MB) file from\n[gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3202/files/), and place it under\nfolder \"~/.vim/thesaurus\". If user place the file elsewhere, be sure to let\nthis plugin know the location of your `mthesaur.txt` file by adding the line\n\n```\n    let g:thesaurus_query#mthesaurus=\"/directory/to/your/mthesaur.txt\n```\n\ninto your `.vimrc`.\n\n# I'm not satisfied with Default experience, how can I customize it\n\nCurrently, `8` global variables and `3` commands created for you to customize\nplugin's detailed behaviors. Including backend query sequence, keymappings and\nresult truncations. Some are described in\n[README.md](https://github.com/Ron89/thesaurus_query.vim/blob/version0_1_0/README.md).\nAnd all of them are documented in detail in\n[documentation](https://github.com/Ron89/thesaurus_query.vim/blob/version0_1_0/doc/thesaurus_query.txt).\n"}
