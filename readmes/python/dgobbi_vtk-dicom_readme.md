DICOM for VTK

Copyright (c) 2012-2022, David Gobbi
All rights reserved.

See Copyright.txt for more details.

This package contains a set of classes for managing DICOM
files and metadata from within VTK, and some utility programs
for interrogating and converting DICOM files.

Note that if you download the zip file from github, all of the
files will have unix-style line endings.  Windows users should
therefore clone the repository with git, instead of downloading
the zip file, otherwise they might have difficulty viewing and
compiling the source code.

The source should compile on Windows, OS X, and Linux.  CMake is
required to build the source.  Detailed build instructions are
given on the last page of the pdf file listed below.
