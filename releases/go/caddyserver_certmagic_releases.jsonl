It includes a number of breaking changes (for the better, I promise) -- so please pay attention:\r\n\r\n- :warning: All storage methods now require [`context.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context) passed in. We also added it to `CleanUpOwnLocks()` and several other functions that end up calling Storage methods (e.g. `CacheUnmanagedTLSCertificate()`). Your editor, in combination with gopls (the Go language server) should be able to quickly tell you where context is missing.\r\n- :warning: Storage methods now return `fs.ErrNotExist` if a file or key is not found, instead of `certmagic.ErrNotExist`, which has been removed. (The [`io/fs` package](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs) did not exist when CertMagic was first written.)\r\n- :warning: `ACMEManager` has been renamed to `ACMEIssuer`, and `CertificateManager` has been renamed to `Manager`. These renames make naming more consistent and accurate, and less confusing (since ACMEManager was not a CertificateManager, which is a new type).\r\n- Certificate events now provide more useful, actionable information. See #150.\r\n\r\nI have personally submitted PRs to the more popular known storage implementations as a courtesy to help deal with the breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThe nuances of the logic in preparing for DNS challenges have changed slightly, hopefully it will work in more environments.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who contributed! Sorry for any inconvenience with the breaking changes; that's the joy of pre-1.0 libraries. We're almost there, though. It's been 5 years and we might finally be starting to get good at things.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* storage: Require fs.ErrNotExist (fix #168) by @mholt in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/170\r\n* Propagate context in the Storage interface methods by @hairyhenderson in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/155\r\n* Fix crash because of a zero value cert in cache by @skeetmtp in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/177\r\n* Always call checkDNSPropagation in DNS01Solver by @crccw in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/179\r\n* Provide more detailed information in certificate events by @francislavoie in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/150\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @hairyhenderson made their first contribution in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/155\r\n* @skeetmtp made their first contribution in https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/pull/177\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic/compare/v0.15.4...v0.16.0", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caddyserver/certmagic/releases/62801308/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 5}

In other words, if you're not using the `HTTPS()` function, you should set `NextProtos` to the proper values for your application. (This is not new, nor a change. Just a helpful note in the docs.)\r\n- Fixed a bug that affected a small subset of users with lots of on-demand certificates ( > 10,000) and some non-on-demand certificates that would cause the non-on-demand certificates to be evicted from the cache. They are now reloaded later if this happens. (Note: the non-on-demand certs must be managed; this won't work for manually-managed certs.)\r\n- :warning: Changed `ManageSync()` to take a `context.Context` as the first argument, so that synchronous operations can also be cancelled and cleaned up.

This structure allows for greater versatility in the future.\r\n\r\n- The DecisionFunc is now invoked for on-demand TLS renewals (before, it was only queried for initial obtain).\r\n\r\n- The import path has changed! It's now `github.com/caddyserver/certmagic`. More on that later.\r\n\r\n- Huge benefits with these changes! CertMagic can work with certificate lifetimes down to less than an hour. It works well with non-ACME certificate sources, it is much more resilient to errors, is more efficient at the scale of _hundreds of thousands of certificates_, and we've improved distributed locks with active locking in case processes get killed forcefully! You'll love these improvements in production.\r\n\r\nSorry for the breaking changes. It's for the better, I promise! This year I hope to tag a stable 1.0."}
