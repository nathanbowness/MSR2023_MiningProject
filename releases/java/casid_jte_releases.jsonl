This change allows to structure template files freely. Templates can now live close to the place where they are used. For example:\r\n  - Create high level module directories that contain all templates and are not scattered in tag/layout directories\r\n  - Split a large page in smaller templates that live next to that page\r\n- #125 Added `@raw` keyword for output that is unprocessed by jte\r\n- #122 Faster directory watcher on MacOS\r\n\r\n### Migration Guide\r\n#126 is a breaking change, the old `@tag`/`@layout` is no longer supported. If jte 2 finds those keywords during compilation it will fail and output instructions how to migrate your project automatically.\r\n\r\nHow to upgrade:\r\n- Bump jte dependency to the latest 2.x release\r\n- Compile your templates (either through maven, gradle or by simply opening your website locally)\r\n- In case you use any of the removed keywords, the compiler will fail and output a Java class that does the migration\r\n- Create a class with the migration code in your project and run the main method\r\n- Make sure to upgrade the IntelliJ plugin to 2.x\r\n\r\nMigration class, in case you want to migrate right away without the compile step:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Migration {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        gg.jte.migrate.MigrateV1To2.migrateTemplates(java.nio.file.Paths.get(\"your jte source root directory\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### IntelliJ plugin features\r\nYou also want to make sure to use the latest IntelliJ plugin to get support for the new syntax.\r\n- Support for `@template` keyword\r\n- Support for `@raw` keyword\r\n- Move template file refactoring is working now\r\n\r\nIntelliJ can no longer guess the jte root directory by moving up the directory tree until a tag/layout directory is found. You will need to create a `.jteroot` file within the root directory to help the plugin here (the plugin will complain if this file doesn't exist).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/casid/jte/releases/60194656/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}}

See https://github.com/casid/jte/issues/57 for more background information.\r\n\r\nThis is how the `example.jte` file from the front page looks like as `example.kte`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n@import org.example.Page\r\n\r\n@param page:Page\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n    @if(page.description != null)\r\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"${page.description}\">\r\n    @endif\r\n    <title>${page.title}</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <h1>${page.title}</h1>\r\n    <p>Welcome to my example page!</p>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo compile templates with Kotlin as expression language, you need to add the `jte-kotlin` module to your project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>gg.jte</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>jte-kotlin</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.8.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince 1.8.0 both Maven and Gradle plugins can precompile jte and kte files. You can seamlessly call jte templates from kte templates and vice versa. This might be handy if you'd like to migrate the expression language of existing jte templates from Java to Kotlin.\r\n\r\nThe IntelliJ plugin is pretty far already to support kte files (https://github.com/casid/jte-intellij/tree/kotlin-support). There's still one issue with unresolved backwards references. If anyone has an idea why this doesn't work with Kotlin injections (https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360008349720-Kotlin-references-in-MultiHostInjector-are-not-working-correctly), I'm very happy about any hint :-) Regardless there's gonna be a first beta release of the IntelliJ plugin with Kotlin support next week!\r\n\r\nOther bugfixes and improvements:\r\n- #63 package name of template classes can be specified\r\n- #63 better hot reload experience with generated template sources\r\n- #60 Gradle plugin no longer includes source sets which caused problems on some builds\r\n- #52 Fix `hasTemplate` method with `DirectoryCodeResolver`"}
