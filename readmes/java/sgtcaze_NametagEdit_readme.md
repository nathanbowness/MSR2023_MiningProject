This plugin allows users to add up to 16 characters before and after their name. Individual tags can be created for players, or a group can be created that can be joined via permissions.

* Minecraft `1.7.x to 1.12.x` has a max `16 character` limit.
* Minecraft `1.13.x to 1.19.x` has a max `256 character` limit.
* Minecraft `1.16.x to 1.19.x` has `hex color` support.

NametagEdit has support for EssentialsGroupManager, PermissionsEx, zPermissions, LuckPerms and LibsDisguises. If a user changes groups or permissions, their tag is automatically updated.

# Frequently Asked Questions
#### Q: Will this allow me to change my skin and name?
**A:** No. This plugin creates fake scoreboard teams with packets.

#### Q: My client crashes with the reason "Cannot remove from ID#". Why is this?
**A:** Due to how scoreboards were implemented in Minecraft, a player cannot belong to two teams. Any two plugins that use packets or the Bukkit API which alter team prefixes/suffixes will have conflicts. There is currently no way around this.

#### Q: My nametag is cut short, even with LongTags enabled!
**A:** LongTags is only able to disable a longer nametag in the tablist. The name above your head has a different limit (16 characters for prefix and suffix.) We are unable to change this, as this limit is imposed by Mojang.

#### Q: Can I sort nametags in the tab list?
**A:** Yes. Read up on how to use it [here](documentation/Configuration.creole)
