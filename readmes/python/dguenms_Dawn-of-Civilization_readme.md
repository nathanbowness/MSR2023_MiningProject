# Dawn of Civilization

The Dawn of Civilization mod for Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, based on the popular Rhye's and Fall of Civilization mod.

## Overview

Rhye's and Fall of Civilization is one of the most popular mods for Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword. 
Rhye's and Fall intends to turn Civilization into a history simulator: the game is played on a realistic map of the world, civilizations start at historically accurate dates, the AI is encouraged to behave historically, and players can win the games by completing their historical victory.

Dawn of Civilization started out as a RFC modmod making several changes suited to my personal preferences. 
But it has since grown way beyond that.
With RFC not being in active development anymore, DoC has taken over to carry on its torch of providing historical BtS gameplay and now stands as its own full-fledged mod.

As the spiritual successor of Rhye's and Fall, Dawn of Civilization seeks to continue to improve upon its basic formula, and become an even better history simulator while also provide engaging and enjoyable gameplay.

## Installation

If you just want to play, you only need to clone this repo into your mod folder (Beyond the Sword/Mods/) and rename it to "RFC Dawn of Civilization".

Alternate ways to get the mod:
* [Installer for DoC including Modules](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dawnofciv/files/Install%20Dawn%20of%20Civilization.exe/download)
* [Installer for DoC without Modules](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dawnofciv/files/Install%20Dawn%20of%20Civilization%20Core.exe/download)

## Main Features

The main goals of DoC are:
* Representing parts of the world not represented by RFC
* Improving on historical accuracy without sacrificing gameplay
* Offering new content in the form of civilizations and victory types
* Improving and optimizing existing RFC features
* Adjusting base game elements to better suit a historical mod

Rhye's and Fall was created more with the intention of taking the normal BtS content into a framework that makes it a historical simulator. 
Dawn of Civilization looks beyond that and tries to make an even better history simulator by including content beyond what BtS offered. 
This is most evident in the inclusion of additional civilizations, but also in many rule and mechanic changes.

In my opinion, a good historical simulator always also has to be a good game. 
This is why perfect historical accuracy isn't the goal of DoC - playing this game is about making interesting decisions and seeing their impact on the world. 
So instead of forced or scripted historical events, DoC tries to include events and mechanics that encourage developments along historical lines without making them a certainty. 
DoC also isn't a kitchen sink mod - every feature included has to serve a clear purpose in improving historicity or gameplay experience.

All of this shows in the following main features of Dawn of Civilization:
* Inclusion of Beyond the Sword civilizations that have been left out: Korea, Byzantium, Holy Rome
* Many new, completely playable civilizations: Harappa, Polynesia, Tamils, Tibet, Indonesia, Moors, Poland, Italy, Mughals, Thailand, Congo, Argentina, Brazil and Canada
