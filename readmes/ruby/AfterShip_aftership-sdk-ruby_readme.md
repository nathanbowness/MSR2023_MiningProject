## aftership-ruby

Ruby Gem for AfterShip API.

This extension helps developers to integrate with AfterShip easily.

## About AfterShip

AfterShip provides an automated way for online merchants to track packages and send their customers delivery status notifications. Customers no longer need to deal with tracking numbers and track packages on their own. With AfterShip, online merchants extend their customer service after the point of purchase by keeping their customers actively informed, while saving time and money by reducing customersâ€™ questions about the status of their purchase delivery.

## Migration to 4.5.2+

We suggest all users to upgrade your `aftership` gem to v4.5.2 as any earlier versions are NOT maintained, which also means you will need to upgrade your ruby version to at least 2.3.0 to be able to use `faraday` the new http client of the revamped `aftership` gem.

If you want to use recent versions of Faraday, update your Gemfile as below:

```ruby
gem "aftership", "~> 4.5.2"
gem 'faraday', '~> 1.3.0'
```
