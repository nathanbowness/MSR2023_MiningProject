[issue#641](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/641)\r\n- inspircd: disallow `_` in hosts since CHGHOST does not treat it as valid\r\n- relay: allow trailing .'s in subserver names (e.g. `relay.` is now an accepted server suffix)\r\n- stats: hide login blocks in `/stats O` when not relevant to the caller's network\r\n- unreal: work around a potential race when sending kills on join\r\n\r\n#### Internal improvements\r\n- log: use pylinkirc as logger name; this prevents other libraries' debug output from making it to the PyLink log by default\r\n- clientbot: properly bounce kicks on networks not implementing them\r\n- classes: remove channels, modes substitutions from `User.get_fields()`\r\n- various: type-safety fixes to support numeric channel, server, and user IDs (they were previously always strings)\r\n- SQUIT hooks now track a list of affected servers (SIDs) in the `affected_servers` field\r\n- relay: minor optimizations"}

Here is a summary of the most interesting changes - for detailed changelogs, consult the release notes for individual snapshots below.\r\n\r\nThis release does *not* preserve compatibility with third-party plugins written for PyLink 1.x!\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n- **Added support for ngIRCd, ChatIRCd, and beware-ircd** (via protocol modules `ngircd`, `ts6`, and `p10` respectively)\r\n- **Add support for extbans** on UnrealIRCd, Charybdis (and derivatives), InspIRCd, and Nefarious.\r\n- **U-lined services servers can now be configured for use with Relay**:\r\n    - `CLAIM` restrictions are relaxed for service bots, which may now join with ops and set simple modes. This prevents mode floods when features such as `DEFCON` are enabled, and when a channel is accidentally registered on a network not on the CLAIM list.\r\n    - `DEFCON` modes set by services are ignored by Relay instead of bounced, and do not forward onto other networks unless the setting network is also in the channel's `CLAIM` list.\r\n    - To keep the spirit of `CLAIM`, opped services not in a channel's `CLAIM` list are still not allowed to kick remote users, set prefix modes (e.g. op) on others, or modify list modes such as bans.\r\n- **New Antispam plugin, with the ability to kill / kick / block mass-highlight spam and configured \"spam\" strings.**\r\n- **Added TLS certificate verification, which is enabled by default on Clientbot networks**. [issue#592](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/592)\r\n    - This adds the options `ssl_validate_hostname` and `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` options which have defaults as follows:\r\n        - | Server type              | `ssl_validate_hostname`                             | `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` |\r\n          |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\r\n          | Full links (S2S)         | false (implied by `ssl_accept_invalid_certs: true`) | true                       |\r\n          | Clientbot networks (C2S) | true                                                | false                      |\r\n        - `ssl_validate_hostname` determines whether a network's TLS certificate will be checked for a matching hostname.\r\n        - `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` disables certificate checking entirely when enabled, and also turns off `ssl_validate_hostname`.\r\n        - The existing TLS certificate fingerprint options are unchanged and can be turned on and off regardless of these new options.\r\n- New Relay features:\r\n    - LINKACL now supports whitelisting networks in addition to the original blacklist implementation (see `help LINKACL`). [issue#394](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/394)\r\n    - Relay IP sharing now uses a pool-based configuration scheme (`relay::ip_share_pools`), deprecating the `relay::show_ips` and `relay_no_ips` options.\r\n        - IPs and real hosts are shared bidirectionally between all networks in an ipshare pool, and masked as `0.0.0.0` when sending to a network not in a pool and when receiving those networks' users.\r\n    - KILL handling received a major rework ([issue#520](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/520):\r\n        - Instead of always bouncing, kills to a relay client can now be forwarded between networks in a killshare pool (`relay::kill_share_pools`).\r\n        - If the sender and target's networks are not in a killshare pool, the kill is forwarded as a kick to all shared channels that the sender\r\n          has CLAIM access on (e.g. when they are the home network, whitelisted in `CLAIM`, and/or an op).\r\n    - `relay_clientbot` now supports setting clientbot styles by network. [issue#455](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/455)\r\n    - The defaults for CLAIM (on or off) and LINKACL (whitelist or blacklist mode) can now be pre-configured for new channels. [issue#581](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/581)\r\n    - New `relay::allow_free_oper_links` option allows disabling oper access to `CREATE/LINK/DELINK/DESTROY/CLAIM` by default\r\n    - relay_clientbot: add support for showing prefix modes in relay text, via a new `$mode_prefix` expansion. [issue#540](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/540)\r\n- Clientbot is now more featureful:\r\n    - Added support for IRCv3 caps `account-notify`, `account-tag`, `away-notify`, `chghost`, `extended-join`, and `userhost-in-names`\r\n    - Clientbot now supports expansions such as `$nick` in autoperform.\r\n    - Configurable alternate / fallback nicks are now supported: look for the `pylink_altnicks` option in the example config.\r\n    - Added support for WHOX.\r\n    - Clientbot can now optionally sync ban lists when it joins a channel, allowing Relay modesync to unset bans properly. See the `fetch_ban_lists` option in the example config.\r\n    - Failed attempts to join channels are now logged to warning. [issue#533](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/533)\r\n- New commands for the opercmds plugin, including:\r\n    - `chghost`, `chgident`, and `chgname`, for IRCds that don't expose them as commands.\r\n    - `massban`, `masskill`, `massbanre`, and `masskillre`, which allow setting mass bans/kills/G/KLINEs on users matching a `nick!user@host` mask, exttarget, or regular expression. The hope is that these tools can help opers actively fight botnets as they are connected, similar to atheme's `clearchan` and Anope's `chankill` commands.\r\n    - `checkban` and `checkbanre`, which return the users matching a target\r\n- Messages sent by most commands are now transparently word-wrapped to prevent cutoff. [issue#153](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/153)\r\n- PyLink accounts are now implicitly matched: i.e. `user1` is now equivalent to `$pylinkacc:user1`.\r\n- PyLink now responds to remote `/STATS` requests (`/stats c`, `u`, and `o`) if the `stats` plugin is loaded.\r\n- The PyLink service client no longer needs to be in channels to log to them.\r\n\r\n#### Feature changes\r\n\r\n- **The ratbox protocol module has been merged into ts6**, with a new `ircd: ratbox` option introduced to declare Ratbox as the target IRCd. [issue#543](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/543)\r\n- The `raw` command has been split into a new plugin (`plugins/raw.py`) with two permissions: `raw.raw` for Clientbot networks, and `raw.raw.unsupported_network` for other protocols. Using raw commands outside Clientbot is not supported. [issue#565](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/565)\r\n- Some options were deprecated and renamed:\r\n    - The `p10_ircd` option for P10 servers is now named `ircd`, though the old option will still be read from.\r\n    - The `use_elemental_modes` setting on ts6 networks has been deprecated and replaced with an `ircd` option targeting charybdis, elemental-ircd, or chatircd. Supported values for `ircd` include `charybdis`, `elemental`, and `chatircd`.\r\n- The `fml` command in the `games` plugin was removed.\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- clientbot: fix errors when connecting to networks with mixed-case server names (e.g. AfterNET)\r\n- Fix `irc.parse_modes()` incorrectly mangling modes changes like `+b-b *!*@test.host *!*@test.host` into `+b *!*@test.host`. [issue#573](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/573)\r\n- clientbot: fixed sending duplicate JOIN hooks and AWAY status updates. [issue#551](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/551)\r\n\r\n#### Internal improvements\r\n- Reading from sockets now uses a select-based backend instead of one thread per network.\r\n- Major optimizations to to user tracking that lets PyLink handle Relay networks of 500+ users.\r\n- Service bot handling was completely redone to minimize desyncs when mixing Relay and services. [issue#265](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/265)\r\n    - This is done via a new `UserMapping` class in `pylinkirc.classes`, which stores User objects by UID and provides a `bynick` attribute mapping case-normalized nicks to lists of UIDs.\r\n    - `classes.User.nick` is now a property, where the setter implicitly updates the `bynick` index with a pre-computed case-normalized version of the nick (also stored to `User.lower_nick`)\r\n\r\n### Changes in this RC build\r\n\r\nFrom 2.0-beta1:\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- relay: CHANDESC permissions are now given to opers if the `relay::allow_free_oper_links` option is true.\r\n- Relay no longer forwards kills from servers, preventing extraneous kills for nick collisions and the like.\r\n- bots: the `join` command now correctly uses `bots.join` as its permission name (keeping it consistent with the command name).\r\n    - The previous name `bots.joinclient` is still supported for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n#### Documentation updates\r\n- Rewrote the Relay Quick Start Guide. [issue#619](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/619)\r\n- FAQ: expanded Relay section with common questions regarding Relay mechanics (i.e. kill, mode, and server bans handling)\r\n- docs/technical, docs/permissions-reference: many updates to bring up to date with PyLink 2.0\r\n- various: updated the GitHub repository address\r\n"}

[issue#592](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/592)\r\n    - This adds the options `ssl_validate_hostname` and `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` options which have defaults as follows:\r\n        - | Server type              | `ssl_validate_hostname`                             | `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` |\r\n          |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\r\n          | Full links (S2S)         | false (implied by `ssl_accept_invalid_certs: true`) | true                       |\r\n          | Clientbot networks (C2S) | true                                                | false                      |\r\n        - `ssl_validate_hostname` determines whether a network's TLS certificate will be checked for a matching hostname.\r\n        - `ssl_accept_invalid_certs` disables certificate checking entirely when enabled, and also turns off `ssl_validate_hostname`.\r\n        - The existing TLS certificate fingerprint options are unchanged by this and can be turned on and off regardless of these new options.\r\n- New Relay features:\r\n    - **LINKACL now supports whitelisting networks in addition to the original blacklist implementation** (see `help LINKACL`). [issue#394](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/394)\r\n    - relay: The defaults for CLAIM (on or off) and LINKACL (whitelist or blacklist mode) can now be pre-configured for new channels. [issue#581](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/581)\r\n    - You can now set descriptions for channels in `LINKED` via the `CHANDESC` command. [issue#576](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/576)\r\n    - `relay_clientbot` now supports setting clientbot styles by network. [issue#455](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/455)\r\n    - New `relay::allow_free_oper_links` option allows disabling oper access to `CREATE/LINK/DELINK/DESTROY/CLAIM` by default\r\n- New Antispam features (see the `antispam:` example block for configuration details):\r\n    - Antispam now supports text filtering with configured bad strings. [issue#359](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/359)\r\n    - Added `block` as a punishment to only hide messages from other plugins like relay. [issue#616](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/616)\r\n    - Antispam can now process PMs to PyLink clients for spam - this can be limited to service bots, enabled for all PyLink clients (including relay clones), or disabled entirely (the default).\r\n    - IRC formatting (bold, underline, colors, etc.) is now removed before processing text. [issue#615](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/615)\r\n- IPv4/IPv6 address selection is now automatic, detecting when an IPv6 address or bindhost is given. [issue#212](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/212)\r\n- Messages sent by most commands are now transparently word-wrapped to prevent cutoff. [issue#153](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/153)\r\n- The Global plugin now supports configuring exempt channels. [issue#453](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/453)\r\n- Automode now allows removing entries by entry numbers. [issue#506](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/506)\r\n\r\n#### Feature changes\r\n- Relay feature changes:\r\n    - Relay IP sharing now uses a pool-based configuration scheme (`relay::ip_share_pools`), deprecating the `relay::show_ips` and `relay_no_ips` options.\r\n        - IPs and real hosts are shared bidirectionally between all networks in an ipshare pool,\u00a0and masked as `0.0.0.0` when sending to a network not in a pool and when receiving those networks' users.\r\n    - **KILL handling received a major rework** ([issue#520](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/520):\r\n        - Instead of always bouncing, kills to a relay client can now be forwarded between networks in a killshare pool (`relay::kill_share_pools`).\r\n        - If the sender and target's networks are not in a killshare pool, the kill is forwarded as a kick to all shared channels that the sender\r\n          has CLAIM access on (e.g. when they are the home network, whitelisted in `CLAIM`, and/or an op).\r\n- The PyLink service client no longer needs to be in channels to log to them.\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Fixed ping timeout handling (this was broken sometime during the port to select).\r\n- relay: block networks not on the claim list from merging in modes when relinking (better support for modes set by e.g. services DEFCON).\r\n- Reworked relay+clientbot op checks on to [be more consistent](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/compare/fee64ece045ad9dc49a07d1b438caa019c90a778~...d4bf407).\r\n- inspircd: fix potential desyncs when sending a kill by removing the target immediately. [issue#607](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/607)\r\n- UserMapping: fixed a missing reference to the parent `irc` instance causing errors on nick collisions.\r\n- clientbot: suppress warnings if `/mode #channel` doesn't show arguments to `+lk`, etc. [issue#537](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/537)\r\n- Relay now removes service persistent channels on unload, and when the home network for a link disconnects.\r\n- relay: raise an error when trying to delink a leaf channel from another leaf network.\r\n    - Previously this would (confusingly) delink the channel from the network the command was called on instead of the intended target.\r\n- opercmds: forbid killing the main PyLink client.\r\n\r\n#### Internal changes\r\n- Login handling was rewritten and moved entirely from `coremods.corecommands` to `coremods.login`. [issue#590](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/590)\r\n- New stuff for the core network classes:\r\n    - `is_privileged_service(entityid)` returns whether the given UID or SID belongs to a privileged service (IRC U:line).\r\n    - `User`, `Channel` TS values are now consistently stored as `int`. [issue#594](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/594)\r\n    - `match_host()` was split into `match_host()` and `match_text()`; the latter is now preferred as a simple text matcher for IRC-style globs.\r\n- New stuff in utils:\r\n    - `remove_range()` removes a range string of (one-indexed) items from the list, where range strings are indices or ranges of them joined together with a \",\" (e.g. \"5\", \"2\", \"2-10\", \"1,3,5-8\") - [issue#506](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/506)\r\n    - `get_hostname_type()` takes in an IP or hostname and returns an int representing the detected address type: 0 (none detected), 1 (IPv4), 2 (IPv6) - [issue#212](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/212)\r\n    - `parse_duration()` takes in a duration string (in the form `1w2d3h4m5s`, etc.) and returns the equiv. amount of seconds - [issue#504](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/504)\r\n- The TLS/SSL setup bits in `IRCNetwork` were broken into multiple functions: `_make_ssl_context()`, `_setup_ssl`, and `_verify_ssl()`\r\n- Removed deprecated attributes: `irc.botdata`, `irc.conf`, `utils.is*` methods, `PyLinkNetworkCoreWithUtils.check_authenticated()` - [issue#422](https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink/issues/422)\r\n- PyLinkNCWUtils: The `allowAuthed`, `allowOper` options in `is_oper()` are now deprecated no-ops (they are set to False and True respectively)"}

[issue#187](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/187)\r\n- New (alpha-quality) `antispam` plugin targeting mass-highlight spam: it supports any combination of kick, ban, quiet (mute), and kill as punishment. [issue#359](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/359)\r\n- Clientbot now supports expansions such as `$nick` in autoperform.\r\n- Relay now translates STATUSMSG messages (e.g. `@#channel` messages) for target networks instead of passing them on as-is. [issue#570](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/570)\r\n- Relay endburst delay on InspIRCd networks is now configurable via the `servers::NETNAME::relay_endburst_delay` option.\r\n- The servermaps plugin now shows the uplink server name for Clientbot links\r\n- Added `--trace / -t` options to the launcher for integration with Python's `trace` module.\r\n\r\n#### Feature changes\r\n- **Reverted the commit making SIGHUP shutdown the PyLink daemon**. Now, SIGUSR1 and SIGHUP both trigger a rehash, while SIGTERM triggers a shutdown.\r\n- The `raw` command has been split into a new plugin (`plugins/raw.py`) with two permissions: `raw.raw` for Clientbot networks, and `raw.raw.unsupported_network` for other protocols. Using raw commands outside Clientbot is not supported. [issue#565](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/565)\r\n- The servermaps plugin now uses two permissions for `map` and `localmap`: `servermaps.map` and `servermaps.localmap` respectively\r\n- `showuser` and `showchan` now consistently report times in UTC\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- protocols/clientbot: fix errors when connecting to networks with mixed-case server names (e.g. AfterNET)\r\n- relay: fix KeyError when a local client is kicked from a claimed channel. [issue#572](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/572)\r\n- Fix `irc.parse_modes()` incorrectly mangling modes changes like `+b-b *!*@test.host *!*@test.host` into `+b *!*@test.host`. [issue#573](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/573)\r\n- automode: fix handling of channels with multiple \\#'s in them\r\n- launcher: prevent protocol module loading errors (e.g. non-existent protocol module) from blocking the setup of other networks.\r\n    - This fixes a side-effect which can cause relay to stop functioning (`world.started` is never set)\r\n- relay_clientbot: fix `STATUSMSG` (`@#channel`) notices from being relayed to channels that it shouldn't\r\n- Fixed various 2.0-alpha2 regressions:\r\n    - Relay now relays service client messages as PRIVMSG and P10 WALL\\* commands as NOTICE\r\n    - protocols/inspircd: fix supported modules list being corrupted when an indirectly linked server shuts down. [issue#567](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/567)\r\n- networks: `remote` now properly errors if the target service is not available on a network. [issue#554](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/554)\r\n- commands: fix `showchan` displaying status prefixes in reverse\r\n- stats: route permission error replies to notice instead of PRIVMSG\r\n    - This prevents \"Unknown command\" flood loops with services which poll `/stats` on link.\r\n- clientbot: fixed sending duplicate JOIN hooks and AWAY status updates. [issue#551](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/551)\r\n\r\n#### Internal improvements\r\n- **Reading from sockets now uses select instead of one thread per network.**\r\n    - This new code uses the Python selectors module, which automatically chooses the fastest polling backend available ([`epoll|kqueue|devpoll > poll > select`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.6.5/Lib/selectors.py#L599-L601)).\r\n- **API Break: significantly reworked channel handling for service bots**. [issue#265](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/265)\r\n    - The `ServiceBot.extra_channels` attribute in previous versions is replaced with `ServiceBot.dynamic_channels`, which is accessed indirectly via new functions `ServiceBot.add_persistent_channel()`, `ServiceBot.remove_persistent_channel()`, `ServiceBot.get_persistent_channels()`. This API also replaces `ServiceBot.join()` for most plugins, which now joins channels *non-persistently*.\r\n    - This API change provides plugins with a way of registering dynamic persistent channels, which are consistently rejoined on kick or kill.\r\n    - Persistent channels are also \"dynamic\" in the sense that PyLink service bots will now part channels marked persistent when they become empty, and rejoin when it is recreated.\r\n    - This new implementation is also plugin specific, as plugins must provide a namespace (usually the plugin name) when managing persistent channels using `ServiceBot.(add|remove)_persistent_channel()`.\r\n    - New abstraction: `ServiceBot.get_persistent_channels()` which fetches the list of all persistent channels on a network (i.e. *both* the config defined channels and what's registered in `dynamic_channels`).\r\n    - New abstraction: `ServiceBot.part()` sends a part request to channels and only succeeds if it is not marked persistent by any plugin. This effectively works around the long-standing issue of relay-services conflicts. [issue#265](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/265)\r\n- Major optimizations to `irc.nick_to_uid`: `PyLinkNetworkCore.users` and `classes.User` now transparently maintain an index mapping nicks to UIDs instead of doing reverse lookup on every call.\r\n    - This is done via a new `UserMapping` class in `pylinkirc.classes`, which stores User objects by UID and provides a `bynick` attribute mapping case-normalized nicks to lists of UIDs.\r\n    - `classes.User.nick` is now a property, where the setter implicitly updates the `bynick` index with a pre-computed case-normalized version of the nick (also stored to `User.lower_nick`)\r\n- Various relay optimizations: reuse target SID when bursting joins, and only look up nick once in `normalize_nick`\r\n- Rewritten CTCP plugin, now extending to all service bots. [issue#468](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/468), [issue#407](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/407)\r\n- Relay no longer spams configured U-lines with \"message dropped because you aren't in a common channel\" errors\r\n- The `endburst_delay` option to `spawn_server()` was removed from the protocol spec, and replaced by a private API used by protocols/inspircd and relay.\r\n- New API: hook handlers can now filter messages from lower-priority handlers by returning `False`. [issue#547](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/547)\r\n- New API: added `irc.get_server_option()` to fetch server-specific config variables and global settings as a fallback. [issue#574](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/574)\r\n- automode: replace assert checks with proper exceptions\r\n- Renamed methods in log, utils, conf to snake case. [issue#523](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/523)\r\n- Remove `structures.DeprecatedAttributesObject`; it's vastly inefficient for what it accomplishes\r\n- clientbot: removed unreliable pre-/WHO join bursting with `userhost-in-names`\r\n- API change: `kick` and `kill` command funcitons now raise `NotImplementedError` when not supported by a protocol\r\n- relay, utils: remove remaining references to deprecated `irc.proto`"}

This beta release includes all changes from 1.2.1, plus the following:\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n- **Backported the launcher from 2.0-alpha2**:\r\n    - Added support for daemonization via the `--daemon/-d` option. [issue#187](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/187)\r\n    - Added support for shutdown/restart/rehash via the command line. [issue#244](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/244)\r\n    - The launcher now detects and removes stale PID files when `psutil` (an optional dependency) is installed, making restarting from crashes a more streamlined process. [issue#512](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/512)\r\n    - PID file checking is now enabled by default, with the `--check-pid/-c` option retained as a no-op option for compatibility with PyLink <= 1.2\r\n    - Following 2.0 changes, sending SIGUSR1 to the PyLink daemon now triggers a rehash (along with SIGHUP).\r\n- Service bot idents, hosts, and realnames can now be configured globally and on a per-network basis. [issue#281](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/281)\r\n- Relay server suffix is now configurable by network (`servers::<netname>::relay_server_suffix` option). [issue#462](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/462)\r\n- Login blocks can now be restricted to specific networks, opered users, and hostmasks. [issue#502](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/502)\r\n- Relay now supports relaying more channel modes, including inspircd blockhighlight +V and exemptchanops +X (the whitelist was synced with 2.0-alpha3)\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- automode: fix errors when managing channels with multiple #'s in its name\r\n- protocols/p10: fix the `use_hashed_cloaks` option not working correctly (it mistakenly read the value of `use_account_cloaks` instead)\r\n- relay_clientbot: fix `@#channel` messages being relayed to channels other than the target\r\n- Fixed sporadic disconnect issues on `BlockingIOError`, `ssl.SSLWantReadError`, and `ssl.SSLWantWriteError`\r\n- protocols/unreal: fix the wrong hook name being sent when receiving legacy (Unreal 3.2) user introductions\r\n- global: ignore empty `global:` configuration blocks\r\n\r\n#### Misc changes\r\n- Config loading now uses `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()` so that arbitrary code cannot be executed. [issue#589](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/589)\r\n- Significantly revised example-conf for wording and consistency.\r\n- protocols/unreal: bumped protocol version to 4017 (no changes needed)"}

[issue#543](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/543)\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Fix default permissions not applying on startup (2.0-alpha1 regression). [issue#542](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/542)\r\n- Fix rejoin-on-kill for the main PyLink bot not working (2.0-alpha1/[94e05a6](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/commit/94e05a623314e9b0607de4eb01fab28be2e0c7e1) regression).\r\n- Clientbot fixes:\r\n    - Fix desyncs caused by incomplete nick collision checking when a user on a Clientbot link changes their nick to match an existing virtual client. [issue#535](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/535)\r\n    - Fix desync involving ghost users when a person leaves a channel, changes their nick, and rejoins. [issue#536](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/536)\r\n    - Treat 0 as \"no account\" when parsing WHOX responses; this fixes incorrect \"X is logged in as 0\" output on WHOIS.\r\n- protocols/p10: fix the `use_hashed_cloaks` server option not being effective.\r\n- Fix long standing issues where relay would sometimes burst users multiple times on connect. [issue#529](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/529)\r\n    - Also fix a regression from 2.0-alpha1 where users would not be joined if the hub link is down ([issue#548](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/548))\r\n- Fix `$a:account` extbans being dropped by relay (they were being confused with `$a`). [issue#560](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/560)\r\n- Fix corrupt arguments when mixing the `remote` and `mode` commands. [issue#538](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/538)\r\n- Fix lingering queue threads when networks disconnect.

This release includes all changes from 1.2.1, plus the following:\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n- **Login blocks can now be limited by network, user hostname, and IRCop status**: see the new \"require_oper\", \"hosts\", and \"networks\" options in the example config.\r\n- **Added support for ngIRCd, ChatIRCd, and beware-ircd** (via protocol modules `ngircd`, `ts6`, `p10` respectively)\r\n- **Add support for extbans in protocols and relay**: this is supported on UnrealIRCd, Charybdis (and derivatives), InspIRCd, and Nefarious P10.\r\n    - Yes, this means you can finally mute bothersome relay users.\r\n- Clientbot is now more featureful:\r\n    - Added support for IRCv3 caps `account-notify`, `account-tag`, `away-notify`, `chghost`, `extended-join`, and `userhost-in-names`\r\n    - Configurable alternate / fallback nicks are now supported: look for the `pylink_altnicks` option in the example config.\r\n    - Added support for WHOX, to complement IRCv3 `account-notify` and `account-tag`.\r\n    - Relay_clientbot can now relay mode changes as text.\r\n    - Clientbot can now optionally sync ban lists when it joins a channel, allowing Relay modesync to unset bans properly. See the `fetch_ban_lists` option in the example config.\r\n- PyLink received a new launcher, which now checks for stale PID files (when `psutil` is installed) and supports shutdown/restart/rehash via the command line.\r\n- New commands for the opercmds plugin, including:\r\n    - `chghost`, `chgident`, and `chgname`, for IRCds that don't expose them as commands.\r\n    - `massban`, `masskill`, `massbanre`, and `masskillre` - these commands allow setting kickbans, kills, or glines on users matching a PyLink mask (`n!u@h` mask/exttarget) or regular expression. The hope is that these tools can help opers actively fight botnets as they are connected, similar to atheme's `clearchan` and Anope's `chankill` commands.\r\n    - `checkbanre` - a companion to `checkban`, using regex matching\r\n- Better support for (pre-defined) U-lined services servers in relay:\r\n    - `CLAIM` restrictions are relaxed for service bots, which may now join with ops and set simple modes. This prevents mode floods when features such as `DEFCON` are enabled, and when a channel is accidentally registered on a network not on the CLAIM list.\r\n    - `DEFCON` modes set by services are ignored by Relay instead of bounced, and do not forward onto other networks unless the setting network is also in the channel's `CLAIM` list.\r\n    - To keep the spirit of `CLAIM` alive, opped services not in a channel's `CLAIM` list are still not allowed to kick remote users, set prefix modes (e.g. op) on others, or set list modes such as bans.\r\n- Service bots' hostnames and real names are now fully configurable, globally and per network.\r\n- Added per-network configuration of relay server suffixes.\r\n- Added IRC `/STATS` support via the `stats` plugin (`/stats c`, `u`, and `o` are supported so far)\r\n- PyLink's connection time is now displayed when WHOISing service bots. This info can be turned off using the `pylink:whois_show_startup_time` option.\r\n- More specific permissions for the `remote` command, which now allows assigning permissions by target network, service bot, and command.\r\n- New `$service` exttarget which matches service bots by name.\r\n\r\n#### Backwards incompatible changes\r\n- Signal handling on Unix was updated to use `SIGUSR1` for rehash and `SIGHUP` for shutdown - this changes PyLink to be more in line with foreground programs, which generally close with the owning terminal.\r\n- Some options were deprecated and renamed:\r\n    - The `p10_ircd` option for P10 servers is now named `ircd`, though the old option will still be read from.\r\n    - The `use_elemental_modes` setting on ts6 networks has been deprecated and replaced with an `ircd` option targeting charybdis, elemental-ircd, or chatircd. Supported values for `ircd` include `charybdis`, `elemental`, and `chatircd`.\r\n- PID file checking is now enabled by default, along with checks for stale PID files *only* when [`psutil`](https://pythonhosted.org/psutil/) is installed. Users upgrading from PyLink < 1.1-dev without `psutil` installed will need remove PyLink's PID files before starting the service.\r\n- The `fml` command in the `games` plugin was removed.\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Relay should stop bursting channels multiple times on startup now. (`initialize_channel` now skips execution if another thread is currently initializing the same channel)\r\n- Fixed a long standing bug where fantasy responses would relay before a user's original command if the `fantasy` plugin was loaded before `relay`. (Bug #123)\r\n\r\n#### Internal changes\r\n- **API Break**: The protocol module layer is completely rewritten, with the `Irc` and `Protocol`-derived classes combining into one. Porting **will** be needed for old protocol modules and plugins targetting 1.x; see the [new (WIP) protocol specification](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/devel/docs/technical/pmodule-spec.md) for details.\r\n- **API Break**: Channels are now stored in two linked dictionaries per IRC object: once in `irc._channels`, and again in `irc.channels`. The main difference is that `irc._channels` implicitly creates new channels when accessing them if they didn't previously exist (prefer this for protocol modules), while `irc.channels` does not raises and raises KeyError instead (prefer this for plugins).\r\n- **API Break**: Most methods in `utils` and `classes` were renamed from camel case to snake case. `log`, `conf`, and others will be ported too before the final 2.0 release.\r\n- **API Break**: IRC protocol modules' server introductions must now use **`post_connect()`** instead of **`connect()`** to prevent name collisions with the base connection handling code.\r\n- Channels are now stored case insensitively internally, so protocol modules and new plugins no longer need to manually coerse names to lowercase.\r\n- Plugins can now bind hooks as specific priorities via an optional `priority` option in `utils.add_hook`. Hooks with higher priorities will be called first; the default priority value us 500.\r\n- Commands can now be properly marked as aliases, so that duplicates don't show in the `list` command.\r\n- Added basic `GLINE/KLINE` support for most IRCds; work is ongoing to polish this off.\r\n- PyLink accounts are now implicitly matched: i.e. `user1` is now equivalent to `$pylinkacc:user1`\r\n- Added complete support for \"Network Administrator\" and \"Network Service\" as oper types on IRCds using user modes to denote them (e.g. UnrealIRCd, charybdis).\r\n- User and server hop counts are now tracked properly instead of being hardcoded as 1.\r\n- protocols/p10 now bursts IPv6 IPs to supported uplinks.\r\n- Fixed compatibility with ircd-hybrid trunk after commit 981c61e (EX and IE are no longer sent in the capability list)"}

Changes since 1.2-beta1:\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- relay: fix channel claim disabling (i.e. \"`CLAIM #channel -`\" was broken since 1.2-alpha1)\r\n- IRCS2SProtocol: fix `UnboundLocalError` in \"message coming from wrong wrong way\" error\r\n- ts6: fix parsing of the `INVITE` command's `ts` argument\r\n- automode: fix formatting and examples in `setacc` help text\r\n- p10: fix rejoin-on-kick relaying by also acknowledging kicks sent from PyLink to its clients with a PART\r\n\r\n### Major changes since 1.1.x\r\n- Added support for snircd, ircu, and other (generic) P10 variants. The target IRCd can be chosen using the new server-specific `p10_ircd` option; see the example config for details (#330).\r\n- **The `nefarious` protocol module was renamed to `p10`**, as it is no longer Nefarious-specific. You should update your configuration to use the new name!\r\n- **Certain configuration options were renamed / deprecated:**\r\n    - The `bot:` configuration block was renamed to `pylink:`, with the old name now deprecated.\r\n    - `logging:stdout` is now `logging:console` (the previous name was a misnomer since text actually went to `stderr`).\r\n    - The `bot:prefix` option is deprecated: you should instead define the `prefixes` setting in a separate config block for each service you wish to customize (e.g. set `automode:prefix` and `games:prefix`)\r\n- **Using new-style accounts exclusively (i.e. specifying things under `login:accounts`) now requires a `permissions:` block for PyLink to start** (#413).\r\n- New `stats` (uptime info) and `global` (global announcement) plugins.\r\n- Plugins and protocol modules can now be loaded from any directory, using the new `plugin_dirs` and `protocol_dirs` options. (#350)\r\n    - The `pylink-contribdl` utility was dropped as it is now it obsolete.\r\n- Relay message formatting became more flexible, and messages from servers (e.g. spurious invite announcements) can now be dropped: look for the `relay_weird_senders` and `accept_weird_senders` options.\r\n- Relay now forbids linking to channels where the home network is down, which previously caused errors due to unreliable target TS (#419). This, along with the regular TS check, can be overridden with a new `link --force` option.\r\n- The `remote` command now routes replies back to the caller network, and supports service bots that aren't the main PyLink bot via a `--service` option.\r\n- Service bot spawning can now be disabled via the global `spawn_services` and per-service `spawn_service` options; doing so will merge the relevant commands into the main PyLink bot.\r\n- Added a `pylink::show_unknown_commands` option to optionally disable \"unknown command\" errors. This option can also be overridden per-server and per-service (#441).\r\n- Added a `pylink::prefer_private_replies` option to default to private command replies (#409).\r\n- Relay can now announce to leaf channels when the home network disconnects; see the `relay::disconnect_announcement` option (#421).\r\n\r\nFor a full list of changes since 1.1.x, consult the changelogs for the 1.2.x beta and alpha releases below."}

This release includes all fixes from 1.1.2, plus the following:\r\n\r\n#### Feature changes\r\n- Added configurable encoding support via the `encoding` option in server config blocks ([#467](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/pull/467)).\r\n- **Certain configuration options were renamed / deprecated:**\r\n    - The `bot:` configuration block was renamed to `pylink:`, with the old name now deprecated.\r\n    - `logging:stdout` is now `logging:console` (the previous name was a misnomer since text actually went to `stderr`).\r\n    - The `bot:prefix` option is deprecated: you should instead define the `prefixes` setting in a separate config block for each service you wish to customize (e.g. set `automode:prefix` and `games:prefix`)\r\n- Added new `$and` and `$network` exttargets - see the new [exttargets documentation page](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/1.2-beta1/docs/exttargets.md) for how to use them.\r\n- Hostmasks can now be negated in ban matching: e.g. `!*!*@localhost` now works. Previously, this negation was limited to exttargets only.\r\n- `relay_clientbot` no longer colours network names by default. It is still possible to restore the old behaviour by defining [custom clientbot styles](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/1.2-beta1/docs/advanced-relay-config.md#custom-clientbot-styles).\r\n- `relay_clientbot` no longer uses dark blue as a random colour choice, as it is difficult to read on clients with dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes\r\n- Fix service respawn on KILL not working at all - this was likely broken for a while but never noticed...\r\n- Fix kick-on-rejoin not working on P10 IRCds when `joinmodes` is set. (a.k.a. acknowledge incoming KICKs with a PART per [the P10 specification](https://github.com/evilnet/nefarious2/blob/ed12d64/doc/p10.txt#L611-L618))\r\n- servprotect: only track kills and saves to PyLink clients, not all kills on a network!\r\n- Fix `~#channel` prefix messages not working over relay on RFC1459-casemapping networks ([#464](https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/issues/464)).\r\n- Show errors when trying to use `showchan` on a secret channel in the same way as actually non-existent channels. Previously this error response forced replies as a private notice, potentially leaking the existence of secret/private channels.\r\n- example-conf: fix reversed description for the password encryption setting.\r\n\r\n#### Internal changes\r\n- Portions of the IRC/relay stack were refactored to prevent various hangs on shutdown.\r\n- Performance improvements for outgoing message queuing: the queue system now blocks when no messages are in the queue instead of polling it multiple times a minute.\r\n- Logging fixes: startup warnings (e.g. from config deprecations) now log to files as well as the console.\r\n"}

Existing configurations will still work, as the `bot` and `pylink` blocks are always merged together (#343).\r\n- Added better documentation for generic options available to all service bots (`nick`, `ident`, `prefix` for fantasy, etc.)\r\n- `Irc.botdata`, `Irc.conf`, `Irc.checkAuthenticated()` have been deprecated: use `conf.conf['pylink']`, `conf.conf`, and the permissions API respectively instead!"}

This is mostly a cleanup and documentation update from 1.1-beta2, with the following additional change:\n- Made passlib an optional dependency (password hashing will be disabled if passlib isn't installed), simplifying the upgrade process.\n\nFor a full list of changes since 1.0.x, see the release notes for the 1.1 alpha & beta series. Summary of major changes since 1.0.x:\n- :closed_lock_with_key: **Redone authentication configuration**, now supporting **multiple accounts**, hashed passwords, and fine-tuned permissions.\n  - Old configurations using `login:user` and `login:password` will still work, but are now deprecated. Consider migrating to the new `login:` block in the example config.\n  - This also adds a new optional dependency of passlib (https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is required for the password hashing portion.\n- Protocol modules now wrap long messages (SJOIN and MODE) to prevent cutoff shenanigans from happening.\n  - This fixes a particularly nasty bug that can corrupt the TS on UnrealIRCd channels if a MODE command sets more than 12 modes at once (#393).\n- Added utilities to download contrib modules (`pylink-contribdl`) and hash passwords for the new accounts configuration (`pylink-mkpasswd`).\n- Most plugins were ported to the permissions API.\n- Clientbot now supports mode syncing, SASL (with optional reauth), and IRCv3 multi-prefix.\n- Services bots now support setting modes on themselves on join: see \"joinmodes\" in the example conf\n- Changehost gained a few new features, including optional (per network) vHost enforcement.\n- Added a `bindhost` option in server blocks, for multi-homed hosts.\n- PID file checking was implemented - Run PyLink with the `--check-pid` argument in order to turn it on.\n- The `ts6` protocol module now supports `KICK` without arguments and legacy `UID` introduction (for older servers / services).\n- Relay: added a `purge` command to remove all relays involving a network.\n- Added support for ircd-ratbox (`ratbox` protocol module).\n- Changing the console log level via REHASH now works.\n- New `servermaps` plugin, displaying network `/map`'s from the PyLink server's perspective.\n"}

Changes from 1.1-beta1:\n\n#### Bug fixes\n- Protocol modules now wrap longer messages (SJOIN and MODE) to prevent cutoff shenanigans from happening.\n  - This fixes a particularly nasty bug that can corrupt the TS on UnrealIRCd channels if a MODE command sets more than 12 modes at once (#393).\n- Pong handling is a lot less strict now (it just makes sure the sender is the uplink). In other words, fix issues on UnrealIRCd where PONGs get ignored if the argument doesn't match the server name exactly (e.g. different case).\n- Clientbot protocol fixes:\n  - Fix SASL PLAIN auth on Python 3.4 (TypeError with bytes formatting with `%b`).\n  - Don't repeat KICK hooks if the source is internal: this prevents KICK events from being relayed twice to Clientbot links, when the kicked user is also a Clientbot user.\n  - Clientbot now explicitly sends `/names` after join, to guarantee a response.\n  - Fix message recognition treating nick prefixes without `ident@host` as servers (this polluted the state)\n  - Fix prefix mode changes for unknown/missing users in `/who` causing KeyError crashes\n- ts6: fix setting mode `-k *` not working due to wrongly ordered logic (1.1-dev regression)\n- ts6: fix handling of KICK without a reason argument\n- Automode: remove some repeated \"Error:\" text in error messages\n- `IrcChannel` no longer assumes `+nt` on new channels, as this is not necessarily correct\n\n#### Feature changes\n- Changing the console log level via REHASH is now supported.\n- Added a bind host option for multi-homed hosts.\n\n#### Internal improvements\n- updateTS now ignores any broken TS values lower than 750000, instead of propagating them (e.g. over relay) and making the problem worse.\n- The UnrealIRCd protocol module was updated to actually use extended SJOIN (SJ3). This should make bursts/startup more efficient, as modes, users, and bans are now sent together.\n"}

This release includes all bug fixes from PyLink 1.0.4, along with the following:\n\n### Changes from 1.1-alpha1\n\n#### Feature changes\n- Most plugins were ported to use the permissions API, meaning multiple accounts are actually useful now!\n  - Having a **PyLink login** with _new_ style accounts **no longer implies access to everything** on the PyLink daemon. See the updated example conf regarding the new `permissions:` block.\n  - **Logins implying admin access** is limited to **old accounts ONLY** (i.e. logins defined via login:user/password)\n  - The `commands` plugin now has permissions checks for `echo`, `showuser`, `showchan`, and `status`. The latter three are granted to all users (`*!*@*`) by default, while `echo` is restricted.\n- Clientbot now supports IRCv3 SASL (with optional reauth!) and multi-prefix. See the example conf for details on the former (the latter is enabled automatically when available).\n- PID file checking is now **disabled** by default for better migration from 1.0.x. Run PyLink with `--check-pid` in order to turn it on.\n- commands: add a new `logout` command (#370)\n- The `list` command now supports optionally filtering commands by plugin.\n\n#### Bug fixes\n- The permission to use servermaps is now `servermaps.map` instead of `servermap.map`.\n- networks: fix the `remote` command to work with permissions (i.e. override the correct account name)\n- relay: add missing permissions check on the `linked` command\n\n#### Internal fixes / improvements\n- relay: rewrite host normalization to whitelist instead of blacklist characters. This should improve compatibility with IRCds as previously untested characters are introduced.\n- relay_clientbot: faster colour hashing using built-in `hash()` instead of md5\n- opercmds: removed the source argument from `kick` and `kill`; it's confusing and isn't very useful\n\n#### Misc. changes\n- Documentation updates: add a permissions reference, document advanced relay config, etc.\n"}

Relay links can be expanded as well to make this more detailed!\n- Oper status tracking is now a network-specific option, for better security. Look for \"track_oper_statuses\" in the example config.\n- The PyLink launcher now sets the terminal title on launch (Windows & POSIX)\n- relay: implement a complementary `showchan` command, showing a list of relay links\n\n#### Bug fixes\n- Relay is potentially less crashy when PyLink is split off while it tries to introduce users (#354).\n- The `bots` plugin now allows JOIN/NICK/PART on all service bots\n- Relay: skip channel TS check for Clientbot (some users had this as a sporadic issue)\n- Irc: explicitly kill connect loop threads after an Irc object has been removed. This fixes various freezing issues caused by ghosted connections after a network splits (#351).\n- Relay: don't error when removing a channel from a network that isn't connected. (AttributeError on `removeChannel()` if `irc.pseudoclient` isn't set)\n\n#### Internal fixes / improvements\n- Server ID and service client name (if applicable) are now stored inside `IrcUser` objects, removing the need for some expensive reverse lookups\n- Relay and Automode now use a centralized DataStore (backwards compatible) in `structures` for their database implementation\n- Docstring rewrapping is now supported for neater, wrappable docstrings! (#307)\n- `Irc.error()` was added for easier error replies; it is a simple wrapper around `Irc.reply()`\n- Relay now uses locks in DB read/writes, for thread safety\n- Most camel case functions in Relay were renamed to lowercase with underscores (PEP 8)\n\n#### Misc. changes\n- exec: Drop `raw` text logging to DEBUG to prevent information leakage (e.g. passwords on Clientbot)\n- Removed `update.sh` (my convenience script for locally building + running PyLink)\n"}

Note: This is an **alpha** build and may not be completely stable! This version includes all fixes from PyLink 0.9.2, with the following additions:\n\n### Changes from 0.9.2\n\n#### Bug fixes\n- Improved syncing between Automode and Relay on JOINs. In other words: fixed Automode sometimes setting modes on join before all of a target's relay clones have joined corresponding relay channels on remote networks.\n- protocols/inspircd now tracks required modules for vHost updating (CHGHOST/IDENT/NAME), instead of potentially sending unknown commands to the IRCd and causing a netsplit.\n- changehost now explicitly forbids `$host` from being used in expansion fields, preventing vHosts from potentially being set in a loop whenever `applyhosts` is called.\n- `eval` now formats empty strings correctly, instead of having no visible reply. In other words, it now wraps all output with `repr()`.\n- relay: fix reversed prefix mode order in bursts (e.g. `+@~UID` instead of `~@+UID`). Fortunately, this is minor detail; no noticeable adverse effects to IRCd linking was ever experienced.\n\n#### Feature changes\n- **WIP** Clientbot protocol module: allows PyLink to connect as a bot to servers, for purposes such as relay.\n  - Some features such as flood protection, services account tracking, and IRCv3 support are still missing.\n  - **For Clientbot relay support, remember to also load the `relay_clientbot` plugin!**\n- Added the ability to rotate logs at certain sizes, keeping X backups for reference.\n- REHASH now updates file logging settings.\n- Relay now allows configuring a list of nick globs to always tag nicks (`forcetag_nicks:` block in `relay:`)\n- networks: new `reloadproto` command, allowing in-place reloading of protocol modules without restart.\n- Ctrl-C / KeyboardInterrupt now cleanly shuts down PyLink (in most cases).\n- SSL cert file and key file are now optional.\n- changehost: show more friendly errors when an expansion field is unavailable\n- protocols/inspircd: add support for SAKICK, ALLTIME.\n- protocols/ unreal: add support for TSCTL ALLTIME.\n- Added support for `/time` requests.\n\n#### Internal fixes / improvements\n- Shutdown now cleanly quits the PyLink service bot instead of simply splitting off.\n- PyLink now shows a better error if a protocol module chosen is missing.\n- Config key validation is now protocol-specific.\n- The `IrcUser.identified` attribute was renamed to `IrcUser.account`.\n- exec: make `pylinkirc` and `importlib` accessible for easier debugging.\n- SQUIT hooks get a few more arguments, such as `nicks` (affected nicks) and `serverdata` (old IrcServer object).\n- Retrieving the hostname used by the current PyLink instance is now a shared function: `irc.hostname()`\n- Better handling of empty lines in command help - these are now sent as a single space instead of passing invalid text like `:<UID> NOTICE <UID> :` to the IRCd (no text in the text parameter).\n- protocols/ts6: handle incoming ETB (extended topic burst) and EOPMOD (partial support; op moderated +z messages are converted to forms like `@#channel`).\n- protocols/unreal: explicitly declare support for ESVID, or account name arguments in service stamps. Realistically this doesn't seem to affect S2S traffic, but it is the correct thing to do.\n\n#### Misc. changes\n- `FakeIRC` and `FakeProto` are removed (unused and not updated for 0.10 internal APIs)\n"}

Thanks to Speakz on Evilnet IRC for reporting.\n- protocols/unreal: fix server name of the uplink server not being saved (#268)\n- Channel prefixes are now sorted in WHOIS output (i.e. no more wrong `@~#channel`), and only the highest prefix shown\n- Fixed issues in internal channel mode tracking (c1cd6f4 58d71b0)\n- WHOIS requests to the PyLink server for clients that aren't PyLink bots now work (syntax: `/raw whois pylink.server somenick`). \"No such nick\" errors are also sent when the target is missing, instead of raising warnings. \n  - These WHOIS responses were previously sent from the wrong source (the server that the client was on, instead of the PyLink server), causing them to be ignored if they were going the wrong way.\n- Automode now treat channels case insensitively in `delacc`.\n- `ascii` and `rfc1459` case mappings now treat Unicode case sensitively, in the same way an IRCd would.\n\n##### Internal improvements\n- Removed inaccurate references to signon time in WHOIS and elsewhere.\n- Changes to user timestamps are now tracked on NICK and SAVE commands\n- Relay now creates relay clones with the current time as nick TS, instead of the origin user's TS.\n  - This has the effect of purposely losing nick collisions against local users, so that it's easier to reclaim nicks.\n"}

Do this via `python3 setup.py install --user`.\n\n##### Added / changed / removed features\n- New **`ctcp`** plugin, handling CTCP VERSION and PING ~~(and perhaps an easter egg?!)~~\n- New **`automode`** plugin, implementing basic channel ACL by assigning prefix modes like `+o` to hostmasks and exttargets.\n- New exttarget support: see https://github.com/GLolol/PyLink/blob/0.9-alpha1/coremods/exttargets.py#L15 for a list of supported ones.\n- Relay can now handle messages sent by users not in a target channel (e.g. for channels marked `-n`)\n- Relay subserver spawning is now always on - the `spawn_servers` option is removed\n- Relay can now optionally show netsplits from remote networks, using a `show_netsplits` option in the `relay:` block\n- The `channels` configuration option in `server:` blocks is now optional, and defaults to no channels if not specified \n- The `maxnicklen` configuration option is also now optional, with a default value of 30 characters.\n- `--version`, `--no-pid`, and `--help` are now implemented by PyLink's command line script\n- Test cases were dropped - they were broken and poorly maintained.\n- CPUlimit wrapper scripts were removed.\n- Service bots now allow plugins to define service descriptions and mark commands as featured when adding them.\n- Command replies for services bots are now consolidated into core. In general, FANTASY commands now reply in channel as PRIVMSG, while all commands sent in PM reply as private notices.\n- protocols/inspircd: new `use_experimental_whois` server option, which forces PyLink to handle WHOIS requests locally. This allows relay WHOIS extensions like account name and origin server name (`whois_show_*` options) to actually work on InspIRCd networks.\n- PyLink can now optionally protect its services clients by setting servprotect modes (InspIRCd umode `+k`, `+S` elsewhere). The option for this is `protect_services` in the `bot:` block.\n- The `networks` now deletes IRC objects when `disconnect` is used. To reconnect all disconnected networks, use the `rehash` command.\n- Relay now hides disconnected leaf networks from LINKED output.\n\n##### Bug fixes\n- Services bots will now ignore unhandled CTCP requests, instead of responding with \"Unknown command\"\n- The `sid` field for TS6 servers now accepts unquoted numeric SIDs (integers) by normalize the SID to a string\n- protocols/nefarious: fix wrong variable in \"/join 0\" handling causing crashes\n- The PyLink bot now rejoins relay channels when it is killed\n- protocols/ts6: fix wrong args in TB handling\n\n##### Internal improvements\n- `coreplugin.py` is split into `coremods/`, with many different submodules for easier maintenance.\n- Rewritten channel TS handling to be more concise and reusable\n- protocols/unreal: warn about mode bounces instead of fighting with the uplink\n- protocols/ts6, protocols/nefarious: use protocol-specific ban bursting instead of sending a regular MODE\n- `Irc.parseModes()` now handles strings given as the mode list properly, instead of only accepting a list of modestring arguments\n- `SQUIT` handlers now return an `uplink` field with the SID of the server that the target was split from\n- protocols/ts6: send 12 users (SJOIN) and 10 modes (TMODE) per line, instead of 10 and 9 respectively\n- Relay is now slightly more careful when normalizing nicks: they can't have invalid characters, start with a hyphen (-), etc.\n- Modes are now sorted when joined. You'll now see things like `+Hiow` instead of `+wHoi`\n- protocols/inspircd: services clients with mode +k now have the \"Network Service\" oper type, in WHOIS replies and elsewhere\n- SQUIT and KILL handling are moved into a protocols/ircs2s.py module, as the handling is basically the same on both TS6 and P10.\n- protocols/nefarious,ts6,unreal: KILL handling (inbound & outbound) now supports kill paths and formats kill reasons properly\n- protocols: encapsulated (ENCAP) commands are now implicitly expanded, so protocol modules no longer need to bother with IF statement chains in a `handle_encap()`\n"}
