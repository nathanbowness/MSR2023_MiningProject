Support for deaza/dethia\r\n- Support nitrile as a suffix on amino acids [contributed by John Mayfield]\r\n- Support more glycero-n-phospho substituents\r\n- Support for chloroxime and other haloximes\r\n- Support cis/trans on rings where a stereocenter has two non-hydrogen substituents, using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules to determine which are relative\r\n- Multiple improvements to implicit bracketting logic\r\n- Corrected interpretation of methylselenopyruvate\r\n- Added group 1/2 nitrides e.g. magnesium nitride\r\n- Added molecular diatomics e.g. molecular hydrogen (or dihydrogen)\r\n- Fixed out of memory error if a fusion bracket referenced an interior atom instead of a peripheral atom\r\n- Fixed out of memory error while parsing very long ambiguous input, by switching parsing algorithm from breadth-first to depth-first\r\n\r\n**Dependency changes:**\r\n\r\n- Updated logging from Log4J v1.2.17 to the latest Log4J2 (v2.17.0). Neither OPSIN 2.5.0 nor 2.6.0 are vulnerable to Log4Shell. The logging implementation is only included in the opsin-cli module\r\n- opsin-inchi now uses [JNA-InChI](https://github.com/dan2097/jna-inchi) rather than JNI-InChI. This supports the latest version of InChI and also support new Macs with ARM64 processors\r\n- Woodstox now uses groupid com.fasterxml.woodstox (the groupid change did not signify a break in API compatibility)\r\n- dk.brics.automaton now uses groupid dk.brics (the groupid change did not signify a break in API compatibility)\r\n- commons-cli is only used by the opsin-cli module"}

XOM Element\r\n* OPSIN now attempts to identify if a chemical name is ambiguous. Names that appear ambiguous return with a status of WARNING with the structure provided being one interpretation of the name\r\n\r\n* Added support for \"alcohol esters\" e.g. phenol acetate [meaning phenyl acetate]\r\n* Multiplied unlocanted substitution is now more intelligent e.g. all substituents must connect to same group, and degeneracy of atom environments is taken into account\r\n* The ester interpretation is now preferred in more cases where a name does not contain a space but the parent is methanoate/ethanoate/formate/acetate/carbamate\r\n* Inorganic oxides are now interpreted, yielding structures with [O-2] ions\r\n* Added more trivial names of simple molecules\r\n* Support for nitrolic acids\r\n* Fixed parsing issue where a directly substituted acetal was not interpretable\r\n* Fixed certain groups e.g. phenethyl, not having their suffix attached to a specific location\r\n* Corrected interpretation of xanthyl, and various trivial names that look systematic\r\n* Name to structure is now ~20% faster\r\n* Initialisation time reduced by a third\r\n* InChI generation is now ~20% faster\r\n* XML processing dependency changed from XOM to Woodstox\r\n* Significant internal refactoring\r\n* Utility functions designed for internal use are no longer on the public API\r\n* Various minor bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Internal XML Changes:\r\n* Groups lacking a labels attribute now have no locants (previously had ascending numeric locants)\r\n* Syntax for addGroup/addHeteroAtom/addBond attributes changed to be easier to parse and allow specification of whether the name is ambiguous if a locant is not provided"}
