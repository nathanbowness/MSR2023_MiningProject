These are detailed in the \r\nchange log below. \r\n\r\nUpdates since v1.0.1\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nNew Packages\r\n\r\n * Added Caffe Segnet\r\n\r\n * Added Darknet\r\n\r\n * Added PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n * Added PyBind11 version 2.2.0\r\n\r\n * Added GTest version 1.8.0\r\n\r\n * Added libgeotiff version 1.4.1\r\n\r\n * Added GEOS version 3.4.2\r\n\r\n * Added PostGIS version 2.1.8\r\n\r\n * Added GDAL 1.11.5\r\n\r\n * Added openjpeg for jpeg2k decoding in GDAL\r\n\r\n * Added qtExtensions\r\n\r\nPackage Upgrades\r\n\r\n * pybind11 to version 2.2.1\r\n\r\n * Upgrade Eigen to version 3.3.4\r\n\r\n * Upgrade libgeotiff to version 1.4.2\r\n\r\n * Upgrade GLog to version 0.3.5\r\n\r\n * Upgrade GFlags to version 2.2.1\r\n\r\n * Updated Caffe to pull from a Kitware clone of the project and applied\r\n   various patches to allow it to build on Windows.\r\n\r\n * Added experimental support for ffmpeg 3.3.3\r\n\r\n * Associated the patches of Caffe with specific versions\r\n\r\n * Associated the patches of OpenBLAS with specific versions\r\n\r\n * Updated OpenBLAS to version 0.2.20\r\n\r\n * Associated the patches of OpenCV with specific versions\r\n\r\n * Added experimental support for OpenCV version 3.3.0\r\n\r\n * OpenCV no longer links to VTK by default\r\n\r\n * Updated PROJ.4 to 4.9.3.

The default is 1.55.0\r\n\r\n * Added option to build GDAL 2.2.2\r\n\r\n * Upgrade VXL to 63b790a424a9d3fd535ae7278d0a600408dbc08f\r\n\r\n * Add PostgreSQL version 10.2\r\n\r\n * Update GEOS to version 3.6.2\r\n\r\n * Update PotGIS to version 2.4.3\r\n\r\n * Boost 1.65 is now the default, remove Boost 1.55\r\n\r\n * OpenCV 3.4.0 is now the default.\r\n\r\n * Update GDAL to 2.3.0 which is now the default. Maintaining the option\r\n   to build 1.11.5.\r\n\r\n * Update VXL hash to provide support for GCC version 8\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes since v1.0.1\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n * Rename `CUDNN_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` to `CUDNN_ROOT_DIR`.\r\n\r\n * Increase minimum_cmake_required to support CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD\r\n\r\n * Fix python version selection.\r\n\r\n * Allow GLog build on MSVC\r\n\r\n * Associated the patches of ffmpeg with specific versions\r\n\r\n * Added Visual Studio support for Caffe.\r\n\r\n * Clean up CUDA, CUDNN support.\r\n\r\n * Added numpy requirment when building with Caffe and python\r\n\r\n * Patched OpenCV version 3.1.0 for the case the absolute build path contains\r\n   the pattern \"cuda\"\r\n\r\n * Patch Qt to compile on MacOS 10.13\r\n\r\n * Patch libjpeg-turbo's config.guess to support arm boards like TX2\r\n\r\n * Patch libxml2's config.guess to support arm boards like TX2\r\n\r\n * Patch GDAL's config.guess to support arm boards like TX2\r\n\r\n * Patch Protobuf 2 to support arm boards like TX2\r\n\r\n * Patch OpenCV so the FFmpeg libraries it uses can find each other\r\n\r\n * Add 'experimental' packages to VXL and remove BRL\r\n\r\n * Explicitly disable metis support in Suitesparce since it's not used\r\n\r\n * Provide a recognizable download name for Darknet\r\n\r\n * Update the download url for Qt 4, upstream archived the package\r\n\r\n * Fix the numpy find module to reset vars if numpy not found. Allows user to fix existing configuration\r\n"}
