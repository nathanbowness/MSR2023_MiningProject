By @db0.\r\n\r\n## Changelog in v1.4.0\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- Added support for inner classes.\r\n  - _Known limitation: the program only supports one nesting level at the moment. This is in part\r\n    because by writing them recursively, we would not have enough heading levels (web pages support\r\n    6, we are already using 5). Also, we haven't found a project that used that GDScript feature\r\n    yet, nesting sub-classes._\r\n- The shell program `get_reference` now supports command line flags.\r\n- You can specify directories of the Godot project to parse with `get_reference` and the\r\n  `-d/--directory` option.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- There is now a `-V/--version` flag to print the version number.\r\n- Improved the shell program `get_reference`'s code to better report errors and work by calling\r\n  `./get_reference`\r\n- Setter and getter functions now render as a bullet-point list with the member variable they belong to.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Headings now generate only with leading hashes `#` instead of being wrapped in hashes.\r\n- The syntax for tags and other special information now is like JSDoc: `@tags - tag1, tag2, tag3`.\r\n  This differentiates special markup or metadata from the regular docstring. There is also a\r\n  discussion to [adopt markup like this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/177)\r\n  in Godot.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an error when using the `--format hugo` option.\r\n- Added the relative \"../\" to links to Fixed links leading to 404 pages.\r\n- Fixed table for setters and getters rendering as plain text with some markdown parsers.\r\n- Fixed function call error in `ReferenceCollector.gd`.\r\n\r\n## Installing ##\r\n\r\nYou can install GDScript Docs Maker with pip:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# On Linux and MacOS:\r\npython3 -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker\r\n\r\n# On Windows, if you installed Python 3.7+, you can use:\r\npython -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started ##\r\n\r\nRead our README on the [repository's home page](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker)\r\n\r\n## Your feedback ##\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a bug or you have an idea to improve the tool, please [open an issue](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker/issues/new)!\r\n\r\nAlso, check out our [GDQuest contributor's guidelines](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/contributing-to/gdquest-projects/)\r\n\r\n## Support us ##\r\n\r\nOur work on Free Software is sponsored by our [Godot game creation courses](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/).

To do so, use the new\r\n  command-line option `--make-index`. This generates an extra `index.md` file.\r\n- You can now **link between classes**, including to specific methods and\r\n  properties:\r\n    - Write `[ClassName]`, `[ClassName.symbol]`, or `[symbol_in_this_class]` and\r\n    docs maker will replace it with a link to the corresponding page and\r\n    heading.\r\n- Add support for the **class category**` metadata: this allows you to group\r\n  classes by categories. Add a line with `# category: My Category` in your\r\n  class's docstring to register a category for it.\r\n- Classes now show all ancestors they extend, and the extends list links to\r\n  the reference of parent classes.\r\n- Store and write key project information: name, description, and human-readable\r\n  version string.\r\n    - We get them from the Application Settings in your Godot project.\r\n    - For the project version, in 3.2.0, you need to add it yourself as\r\n      `application/config/version. It must be with the form \"1.0.0\". Future or\r\n      more recent Godot versions should have this defined by default. Upon\r\n      exporting your game, Godot should also use this version number.\r\n\r\n### Improvements ###\r\n\r\n- The Windows `generate_reference.bat` command-line script now supports\r\n  command-line flags and arguments. The script also now checks for and prevents\r\n  common errors.\r\n- Remove `extends` line if the class doesn't extend any type.\r\n- Remove properties summary and methods summary if the class respectively\r\n  doesn't have public properties or methods.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n- Changed the default export directory to \"export\", as we use \"dist\" to build\r\n  the program's pip package itself.\r\n\r\n## Installing ##\r\n\r\nYou can install GDScript Docs Maker with pip:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# On Linux and MacOS:\r\npython3 -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker\r\n\r\n# On Windows, if you installed Python 3.7+, you can use:\r\npython -m pip install gdscript_docs_maker\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started ##\r\n\r\nRead our README on the [repository's home page](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker)\r\n\r\n## Your feedback ##\r\n\r\nIf you encounter a bug or you have an idea to improve the tool, please [open an issue](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker/issues/new)!\r\n\r\nAlso, check out our [GDQuest contributor's guidelines](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/contributing-to/gdquest-projects/)\r\n\r\n## Support us ##\r\n\r\nOur work on Free Software is sponsored by our [Godot game creation courses](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/).

Outputs the data as JSON.\r\n- Converts the JSON data to markdown files.\r\n    - Writes methods, static functions, signals, member variables, and class data.\r\n    - Only writes relevant sections. For example, the tool only creates a \"Method Descriptions\" section if there are methods in the class.\r\n    - Skips built-in callbacks, i.e. `_process`, `_input`, etc. \r\n    - Skips the constructor, `_init`, unless it has arguments.\r\n    - Skips private functions and member variables, unless tagged as virtual.\r\n- Supports tags in the source code with the `tags:` keyword followed by comma-separated strings, like `tags: virtual, deprecated`.\r\n    - Currently, the program only takes `virtual` into account, but it does store all the tags.\r\n- There are two shell scripts for POSIX shells (sh, bash, etc.) and Windows CMD, respectively.
