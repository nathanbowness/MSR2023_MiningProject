This repository is unmaintained. Please see [x/crypto/ed25519](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519) for a maintained version.

Before trying to recover a previous version from git, note that I left [a one-bit leak](https://github.com/agl/ed25519/issues/27) in the Elligator code in for years because I'm literally not looking at the PRs. Uncared for code is not a foundation to build upon.
