The primary sort is on time; secondary on \n  ordinality for the event (which is user-definable, but defaults\n  to an ordinality for the class); and the \n  third is the order in which the events were added.  Thus \n  is becomes easier to, say, make an RPN call, which entails \n  and ordered series of control change events all occurring at the \n  same time and of the same type.\n- Added `annotation` as a parameter to note addition function. \n  This can be used to attach an arbitrary python object to the \n  note event. This is useful for extension development.\n"}
