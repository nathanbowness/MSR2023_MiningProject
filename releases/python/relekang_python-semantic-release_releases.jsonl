Although this is not a breaking change, I strongly recommend you switch to it for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- It is [recommended by PyPI](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).\r\n- Tokens can be given access to a single project, which reduces the possible damage if it is compromised.\r\n- If your PyPI username is the same as your GitHub and you have it set as a secret in a CI service, they will likely scrub it from the build output. This can break things, for example repository links.\r\n"}
