The main reason for bumping the major version is that we are following [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and introduced non-backwards compatible changes to some APIs and the source code of the Importer/Exporter.  \r\n\r\n**Notable new features and additions**\r\n* Added Docker files to build your own images for the Importer/Exporter command-line interface. Pre-built Docker images are available from Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/r/3dcitydb/impexp. #209\r\n* Added an import list filter to the import operation for both the GUI and the CLI that allows a user to provide a CSV file containing identifiers of features that shall be imported or skipped. #202\r\n* Enhanced feature version filter to support searching for terminated features. #192, #185\r\n* Added a *Plugins* section to the preferences tab of the Importer/Exporter GUI that lists all installed and available plugins and lets a user dynamically enable and disable plugins. #194\r\n* Added the `FeatureImportExtension` plugin extension that lets you hook your code into the import operation. #195\r\n* `MetadataProvider` is now a plugin extension in its own right and can be used without `FeatureExportExtension`.\r\n* Affine transformations are now also available for the CityGML/CityJSON export operation. #196\r\n* Added support for importing `gml:MultiGeometry` objects in case they only contain points or curves.\r\n* Added support for providing database connection details via environment variables when running the Importer/Exporter on the command line. #212\r\n* CityJSON output now uses the latest CityJSON version 1.0.3.\r\n\r\nPlease note that **starting from this release**, the installer of the Importer/Exporter is **no longer provided here** but can be downloaded from the [3dcitydb-suite](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-suite) repository. [Click here](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-suite/releases/tag/v2021.1.0) to get the installer for this release.\r\n\r\nSee the [change log](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the complete list of changes."}

But there is also benefit in having plugins that are just hooked into internal processes such as CityGML imports and exports. This version brings first support for such non-GUI plugins. A new `CityGMLExportExtension` has been added as a first extension point for non-GUI plugins. Using this extension, a plugin receives and can process all CityGML features before they are written to the output file. Besides using XSLT stylesheets for CityGML exports, this adds another way of having full control over the output. _Note:_ Due to the changes to the Plugin API, make sure to only use plugins built for this version.\r\n* Property projections can now also be defined for abstract feature types.\r\n* Fixed broken feature type filter for CityGML imports. [#75](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/75)\r\n* Fixed NPE in `GeometryConverter` when using affine transformations during CityGML imports.

During the past year, we have worked hard to implement support for **CityGML Application Domain Extensions (ADEs)**. The ADE mechanism is a built-in feature of CityGML that allows users to extend the CityGML data model with additional types, attributes and relations, which carry information required for specific applications and which are integrated with the predefined 3D city objects. ADEs are becoming more and more popular, and are defined for various application fields such as energy assessment and simulation ([Energy ADE](http://en.wiki.energy.sig3d.org/index.php/Main_Page)) or modelling of utility networks ([UtilityNetwork ADE](https://en.wiki.utilitynetworks.sig3d.org/index.php/Main_Page)). A non-exhaustive list of further ADE developments is available [here](https://www.citygml.org/ade/).\r\n\r\nWith this release, the 3DCityDB database schema can be dynamically extended by arbitrary ADEs. We have developed a transform method that reads the XML Schema definition of an ADE and automatically derives a relational schema that seamlessly integrates with the 3DCityDB core schema. This method is presented in detail [here](http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1425154/602735.pdf), and has been implemented in the newly available [ADE Manager Plugin](https://github.com/3dcitydb/plugin-ade-manager) for our Importer/Exporter tool. The plugin allows users to register one or more ADEs with an existing 3DCityDB instance and automatically generates SQL scripts to work with the ADE data (e.g. for the performant deletion of ADE objects from the database). **The Importer/Exporter tool itself has been extended with an ADE API**. So, if you want to use this tool to import and export ADE data, then you have to implement this API. An example for an ADE implementation is available [here](https://github.com/3dcitydb/extension-test-ade).\r\n\r\n**Notable new features and additions**\r\n* Added new extension mechanism to support arbitrary CityGML ADEs.\r\n* Added new ADE manager plugin to dynamically extend a 3DCityDB instance with support for a given CityGML ADE.\r\n* Added support for connecting to different database schemas with the same user.\r\n* Added support for XSL transformations on CityGML imports and exports.\r\n* Added support for importing CityGML files with flat hierarchies.\r\n* Added support for importing gml:MultiGeometry objects consisting only of surfaces.\r\n* New LoD filter for CityGML exports.\r\n* Source code has been split into modules that are available as Maven artifacts from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/3dcitydb/maven).\r\n* Switched from Ant to Gradle as build system.\r\n\r\nSee the [change log](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the complete list of changes."}

The 3DCityDB-Web-Map-Client is a [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/)-based 3D web viewer that allows for direct **3D visualization** and **interactive exploration** of **arbitrarily large semantic 3D city models** based on datasets (KML/glTF modes + online spreadsheets) exported using the importer/exporter. \n\nWith this release, the **license of the 3D City Database and all tools has been changed to [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)**. See the `LICENSE` file for more details. Note that previous versions of the software continue to be licensed under GNU LGPL 3.0 license. To request a version before 3.3.0 under Apache License 2.0 create a GitHub issue.\n\n**Notable changes to the importer/exporter tool:**\n- The 3DCityDB-Web-Map-Client is bundled with the importer/exporter and can be chosen to be installed during the installation process.\n- Java 8 is now required.\n- Completely revised and updated documentation.\n- Fixed bug that caused missing altitude mode in KML exports when choosing `clamp to ground` (#10).\n- Fixed bug with locale sensitive strings that caused the importer/exporter to not start correctly (#9).\n- Textures can now be embedded in glTF files (#7).\n- Direct upload of attribute data to Google Spreadsheet has been removed from the [Spreadsheet Generator Plugin](https://github.com/3dcitydb/plugin-spreadsheet-generator). This functionality might come back in future releases.\n\n**Notable changes to the database schema and procedures:**\n- Added missing foreign key constraint from `BRIDGE.ID` to `CITYOBJECT.ID` (PostgreSQL)\n- The `MIGRATION` scripts for Oracle have been optimized to achieve a better performance.\n- Reworked all `UPGRADE` scripts.\n- Fixed `CITYDB_PKG` bugs under Oracle Locator.\n- Fixed issues in the `DELETE` package.\n- Removed `delete_cityobject_cascade` function from `DELETE` package.\n- Fixed `CREATE_DB` issues when `SRID` cannot be found.\n- Completely revised and updated documentation.\n"}

Export and import of CityGML 1.0 datasets are still supported.\n- Performance improvements when reading and writing large CityGML datasets over a network\n- Improved support of 3D city models which use texture atlases regarding a more compact storage and a higher import, export, and visualization performance.\n- Improved handling of 3D models with large coordinate values in the KML/COLLADA Exporter.\n- Both Oracle and PostGIS databases are supported by the same Import/Export tool (there are no longer separate versions of the Import/Export tool).\n- Unified concept for the storage of image data in Oracle and PostGIS.\n- The 3D City Database now shares the same version number.\n- Completely reworked, extended, and updated documentation.\n\n**Notable new features and functionalities**\n- Support of all new CityGML 2.0 feature types like bridges and tunnels with respect to the previous version of CityGML. Support of CityGML 2.0\u2019s grouping concept for generic attributes.\n- CityGML Solid geometry objects are now stored as 3D solid geometries in Oracle (starting from version 11g) and PostGIS in addition to their decomposition into the individual boundary surfaces.\n- The newly included \u2018Spreadsheet Generator\u2019 plugin allows exporting data from a 3D City Database instance into tables. Supported output formats are Microsoft Excel, CSV, and Google Spreadsheets.\n- Schema files of the database schemas are included for Oracle and PostGIS.\n- Support of GenericCityObjects having point and/or line geometries in the KML/ COLLADA Exporter.\n\n**Dropped items or functionalities**\n- The \u2018Merging\u2019 plugin of the previous Importer/Exporter version 1.6.0 was not updated to the new database schema and has been removed.\n- The tool for importing and exporting raster data for Oracle Spatial is no longer supported. Please use third party software instead.\n"}
