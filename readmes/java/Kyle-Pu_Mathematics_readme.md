## Welcome! Plan of Action & Goals
After a long break, this repo is coming back into active status once again!

We aim to build this repo out as an easy way for people to get into the open source community on a broad project open to any and all math programs!

***We're beginning to add  programs in C++ and Python so we can reach more people.***

Please feel free to reach out on our Gitter chat above!

## Who Can Contribute
Anyone! We're really looking for people of all experience levels to come and write some programs.

Some more advanced sub-projects include the GUI and the Graphing Calculator applications.


## Details
The purpose of this app is to assist students with understanding math formulas. Some calculators compute a specific type of calculation for the user and also explain why the answer is what it is.

## Contributing
- We have lots of opportunities available for NOVICE to ADVANCED programmers. Contributions range from developing new math programs to developing graphing calculators and other more complex tasks!
- Be sure to refer to [IDEAS.md](https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/blob/master/IDEAS.md). This is where all our ideas and available work will be hosted. This is **where most of the available coding tasks will be.** Other programming tasks may involve the GUI, but most other opportunities can be found in the issues section of this repository.
- Check the [issues section](https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/issues) to help fix bugs and manage the project.
- Reading this file is a requirement in order to begin contributing: https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. Please pay special attention to how to format your pull requests, issues, etc.

## Future Plan
- Create a GUI
- Bring all this work together into a desktop, online, and mobile app!
