gofmt, and requires Go 1.18 or later.\r\nWe recommend building gofumpt with Go 1.19 for the best formatting results.\r\n\r\nThe jump from Go 1.18 brings diffing in pure Go, removing the need to exec `diff`,\r\nand a small parsing speed-up thanks to `go/parser.SkipObjectResolution`.\r\n\r\nThe following formatting fixes are included as well:\r\n\r\n* Allow grouping declarations with comments - #212\r\n* Properly measure the length of case clauses - #217\r\n* Fix a few crashes found by Go's native fuzzing\r\n\r\nBinaries built on `go version go1.19.1 linux/amd64` via [a shell script](https://github.com/mvdan/dotfiles/blob/53ebffedd5cd0e2095263b335d868a35def3bd53/.bin/go-cross).\r\n\r\nConsider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mvdan) if you benefit from the work that went into this release!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/releases/78266091/reactions", "total_count": 28, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 7,

based on Go 1.18's gofmt. The jump from Go 1.17's gofmt should bring a noticeable speed-up, as the tool can now format many files concurrently. On an 8-core laptop, formatting a large codebase is 4x as fast.\r\n\r\nThe following [formatting rules](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#Added-rules) are added:\r\n\r\n* Functions should separate `) {` where the indentation helps readability\r\n* Field lists should not have leading or trailing empty lines\r\n\r\nThe following changes are included as well:\r\n\r\n* Generated files are now fully formatted when given as explicit arguments\r\n* Prepare for Go 1.18's module workspaces, which could cause errors\r\n* Import paths sharing a prefix with the current module path are no longer grouped with standard library imports\r\n* `format.Options` gains a `ModulePath` field per the last bullet point\r\n\r\nA special thanks to @Oiyoo for his recent contributions as well :tada: \r\n\r\nBinaries built on `go version go1.17.7 linux/amd64` via [a shell script](https://github.com/mvdan/dotfiles/blob/53ebffedd5cd0e2095263b335d868a35def3bd53/.bin/go-cross).\r\n\r\nConsider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mvdan) if you benefit from the work that went into this release!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/releases/60153932/reactions", "total_count": 13, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 9, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 4, "eyes": 0}, "mentions_count": 1}

based on Go 1.17's gofmt. The jump from Go 1.15's gofmt should bring a mild speed-up, as walking directories with `filepath.WalkDir` uses fewer syscalls.\r\n\r\ngofumports is now removed, after being deprecated in v0.1.0. Its main purpose was IDE integration; it is now recommended to use gopls, which in turn implements goimports and supports gofumpt natively. IDEs which don't integrate with gopls (such as GoLand) implement goimports too, so it is safe to use gofumpt as their \"format on save\" command. See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#Installation) for more details.\r\n\r\nThe following [formatting rules](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#Added-rules) are added:\r\n\r\n* Composite literals should not have leading or trailing empty lines\r\n* No empty lines following an assignment operator\r\n* Functions using an empty line for readability should use a `) {` line instead\r\n* Remove unnecessary empty lines from interfaces\r\n\r\nFinally, the following changes are made to the gofumpt tool:\r\n\r\n* Initial support for Go 1.18's type parameters is added\r\n* The `-r` flag is removed in favor of `gofmt -r`\r\n* The `-s` flag is removed as it is always enabled\r\n* Vendor directories are skipped unless given as explicit arguments\r\n* The added rules are not applied to generated Go files\r\n* The `format` Go API now also applies the `gofmt -s` simplification\r\n* Add support for `//gofumpt:diagnose` comments\r\n\r\nBinaries built on `go version go1.17.3 linux/amd64` via [a shell script](https://github.com/mvdan/dotfiles/blob/53ebffedd5cd0e2095263b335d868a35def3bd53/.bin/go-cross).\r\n\r\nConsider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mvdan) if you benefit from the work that went into this release!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/releases/53105717/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 8, "eyes": 0}}

on Go 1.15.x. It solidifies the features which have worked well for over a year.\r\n\r\nThis release will be the last to include `gofumports`, the fork of `goimports` which applies `gofumpt`'s rules on top of updating the Go import lines. Users who were relying on `goimports` in their editors or IDEs to apply both `gofumpt` and `goimports` in a single step should switch to gopls, the official Go language server. It is supported by many popular editors such as VS Code and Vim, and already bundles gofumpt support. Instructions are available [in the README](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt).\r\n\r\n`gofumports` also added maintenance work and potential confusion to end users. In the future, there will only be one way to use `gofumpt` from the command line. We also have a [Go API](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/gofumpt/format) for those building programs with gofumpt.\r\n\r\nFinally, this release adds the `-version` flag, to print the tool's own version. The flag will work for \"master\" builds too.\r\n\r\nBinaries built on `go version go1.15.6 linux/amd64` via [a shell script](https://github.com/mvdan/dotfiles/blob/1b5af4e620dd866b90f785eec4b0e00350d4a19c/.bin/go-cross).\r\n\r\nConsider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mvdan) if you benefit from the work that went into this release!"}
