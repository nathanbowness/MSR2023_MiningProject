`django-rest-authemail` is a Django/Python application that provides a RESTful API interface for user signup and authentication.  Email addresses are used for authentication, rather than usernames.  Because the authentication user model is based on Django's `AbstractBaseUser` and is itself abstract, the model can be extended without the need for additional database tables.  Token authentication allows the API to be accessed from a variety of front ends, including Django, React and AngularJS clients, and iOS and Android mobile apps.


Features
--------

- API endpoints for signup, signup email verification, login, logout, password reset, password reset verification, password change, email change, and user detail.
- Extensible abstract user model.
- Perform password confirmation and other client-side validation on the front end for a better user experience.
- Token authentication.
- User models in the admin interface include inlines for signup and password reset codes.
- An example project is included and contains example UI templates.

	- Supports and tested with Django REST Framework 3.7.1 and 3.11.0.


Installation
------------

`django-rest-authemail` is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-rest-authemail.

Install `django-rest-authemail` using one of the following techniques.

- Use pip.  Note that particular versions of Django and the Django REST Framework may be installed.

```
pip install django-rest-authemail
```

- Download the .tar.gz file from PyPI and install it yourself.
- Download the [source from Github](http://github.com/celiao/django-rest-authemai) and install it yourself.

If you install it yourself, also install [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org), and [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest).

Usage
-----

Create a Django project, if you haven't already. For example,

```python
django-admin startproject mysite
```

In the `settings.py` file of your project, include `rest_framework` and `rest_framework.authtoken` in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Set the authentication scheme for the Django REST Framework to `TokenAuthentication`.

```python
mysite/settings.py
----

INSTALLED_APPS = [
	...
	'rest_framework',
	'rest_framework.authtoken',
	...
]

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
		'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
	)
}
```

Optionally, you may add an `AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` setting to specify whether to enable email verification for new users on account registration/signup. Setting this to `False` will automatically verify newly created users.

Create a Django application for your user data.  For example,

```python
python manage.py startapp accounts
```

In the `models.py` file of your application, extend `EmailAbstractUser`, add custom fields, and assign `objects` to `EmailUserManager()`.  For example,

```python
accounts/models.py
----

from django.db import models
from authemail.models import EmailUserManager, EmailAbstractUser

class MyUser(EmailAbstractUser):
	# Custom fields
	date_of_birth = models.DateField('Date of birth', null=True, blank=True)

	# Required
	objects = EmailUserManager()
```

In the `settings.py` file of your project, include `authemail` and your application in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to the class of your user model.  For example,

```python
mysite/settings.py
----

INSTALLED_APPS = [
	...
	'rest_framework',
	'rest_framework.authtoken',
	'authemail',
	'accounts',
	...
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.MyUser'

```

In the `admin.py` file of your project, extend `EmailUserAdmin` to add your custom fields.  For example,

```python
mysite/admin.py
----

from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from authemail.admin import EmailUserAdmin

class MyUserAdmin(EmailUserAdmin):
	fieldsets = (
		(None, {'fields': ('email', 'password')}),
		('Personal Info', {'fields': ('first_name', 'last_name')}),
		('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_active', 'is_staff', 
									   'is_superuser', 'is_verified', 
									   'groups', 'user_permissions')}),
		('Important dates', {'fields': ('last_login', 'date_joined')}),
		('Custom info', {'fields': ('date_of_birth',)}),
	)

admin.site.unregister(get_user_model())
admin.site.register(get_user_model(), MyUserAdmin)
```


Create the database tables with Django's `makemigrations`, `migrate`, and create a superuser with `createsuperuser`.

```python
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```


Check your setup by starting a Web server on your local machine:

```python
python manage.py runserver
```


Direct your browser to the `Django` `/admin` and log in.

```python
127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

You should see `Users`, `Tokens`, `Password reset codes`, `Signup codes`, and `Groups`.  If you click on `Users`, you should see your superuser account.

Add the `authemail` API endpoints to your project's `urls.py` file.  For example,

```python
mysite/urls.py
----

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
	path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

	path('api/accounts/', include('authemail.urls')),
]
```

When users signup or reset their password, they will be sent an email with a link and verification code.  Include email settings as environment variables or in your project's `settings.py` file.  For example,

```python
mysite/settings.py
----

# Email settings
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/email/
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#email-host

import os

EMAIL_FROM = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM') or '<YOUR DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM HERE>'
EMAIL_BCC = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_DEFAULT_EMAIL_BCC') or '<YOUR DEFAULT_EMAIL_BCC HERE>'

EMAIL_HOST = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_EMAIL_HOST') or 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_EMAIL_PORT') or 587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_EMAIL_HOST_USER') or '<YOUR EMAIL_HOST_USER HERE>'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('AUTHEMAIL_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD') or '<YOUR EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD HERE>'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
```

Try out `authemail` API calls by firing up `python` and using the `authemail` wrapper methods (`runserver` should still be executing).  For example,

```python
python
>>> from authemail import wrapper
>>> account = wrapper.Authemail()
>>> first_name = 'Your first name'
>>> last_name = 'Your last name'
>>> email = 'your_email@gmail.com'
>>> password = 'Your password'
>>> response = account.signup(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name,
... email=email, password=password)
```

In the `Django` `/admin`, you should see a new user (not verified) and a new signup code.  You should receive an email at `your_email@gmail.com`.  Use the code in the email to verify your email address using the wrapper (normally, the link in the email would point to the front end, which would issue the signup verify request to the API):

```python
>>> code = '7f31e7a515df266532df4e00e0cf1967a7de7d17'
>>> response = account.signup_verify(code=code)
```

In the `Django` `/admin`, the new user is now verified and the signup code is absent.  The new user can now login and you can inspect the associated login token:

```python
>>> response = account.login(email=email, password=password)
>>> account.token
'a84d062c1b60a36e6740eb60c6f9da8d1f709322'
```

You will find the same token for the user in the `Token` table in the `Django` `/admin`.  Find out more information about the user (insert your token):

```python
>>> token = 'a84d062c1b60a36e6740eb60c6f9da8d1f709322'
>>> response = account.users_me(token=token)
>>> response
{'id': 1, 'first_name': 'Your first name', 'last_name': 'Your last name', 'email': 'your_email@gmail.com'}
```

Use the authentication token to logout:

```python
>>> response = account.logout(token=token)
>>> response
{'success': 'User logged out.'}
```

Play with password reset and change!

Django REST Framework Browsable API
-----

If you are having trouble getting your code to execute, or are just curious, try out the Django REST Framework Browsable API.  If you type an `authemail` API endpoint into your browser, the Browsable API should appear (`runserver` should still be executing).  For example,

```python
127.0.0.1:8000/api/accounts/signup
```

Enter information in the HTML form fields of the Browsable API, e.g.:

![signup_html_form here](README_images/signup_html_form.jpg)

Then click on `POST`.  You will either receive an error message to help in your debugging, or, if your signup was successful:

![signup_html_form_success here](README_images/signup_html_form_success.jpg)

Try out the other `authemail` API endpoints with the Django REST Framework Browsable API.


Front End Example Project
----

Make `authemail` API calls from front end code.  To get started, follow the steps in the`example_project` `README.md`.  Enhance the Django code in the `example_project` or extend the concepts to React, AngularJS, iOS, and Android front ends.

When calling endpoints from the front end that require authentication (`logout`, `password/change`, and `users/me`), include the authorization token key in the HTTP header.  For example,

```python
Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b
```

Here's an example using ``curl``,

```python
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/accounts/logout/' \
     -H 'Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b'
```

Wrapper
-------
A wrapper is available to access the Authemail API with Python code.  First create an instance of the Authemail class, then call methods to access the API.  There is a one-to-one mapping between the endpoints and instance methods.  For example,

```python
mysite/views.py
----

from authemail import wrapper

account = wrapper.Authemail()
response = account.signup(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name,
	email=email, password=password)

if 'detail' in response:
	# Handle error condition
else:
	# Handle good response
```

See `example_project/views.py` for more sample usage.


Authemail API Endpoints
-----------------------
For the endpoints that follow, the base path is shown as `/api/accounts`.  This path is for example purposes.  It can be customized in your project's `urls.py` file.

**POST /api/accounts/signup**

Call this endpoint to sign up a new user and send a verification email.  Sample email templates are found in `authemail/templates/authemail`.  To override the email templates, copy and modify the sample templates, or create your own, in `your_app/templates/authemail`.

Your front end should handle password confirmation, and if desired, require the visitor to input their first and last names.

Unverified users can sign up multiple times, but only the latest signup code will be active.
