Please stick with plugin version 7.3.0 if you're using an older server version. Dropping support for old versions allowed to modernise huge parts of the code, which means that the plugin is less likely to break when future Minecraft versions are released. As a result, Advanced Achievements will hopefully keep on working for many years in its current state! This also allowed for significant performance improvements.\r\n* Upgrades from plugin versions older than 7.0.0 are no longer supported. If you're updating from an older plugin version, start your server once with version 7.3.0 before moving to 8.0.0, as explained in [the Wiki]('https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/wiki/Updating-the-plugin#updating-to-a-new-major-version').\r\n\r\n* If you're running Minecraft 1.13,1.14, 1.15, you'll now need to do a server restart if you delete achievements from *config.yml*. This is due to a Spigot bug that was subsequently fixed in version 1.16.\r\n* The *AchievementNotStarted*, *AchievementStarted* and AchievementReceived options in *gui.yml* must now comply with the new syntax, with subsections for each *Type* parameter, as shown in the [default configuration]('https://github.com/PyvesB/advanced-achievements/blob/c3c15ec7e83aec9727768c46f9a7bbd22466be54/advanced-achievements-plugin/src/main/resources/gui.yml#L16').\r\n* Support for Jobs Reborn versions older than 4.17.2 has been dropped, please update to a recent version of the plugin to keep on using the corresponding achievement category.\r\n* The deprecated *getPlayerAchievementsList* API method and *Achievement* API class have now been deleted.\r\n"}
