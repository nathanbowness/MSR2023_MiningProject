This is a Python 3 module that exposes the *parse tree* of a PostgreSQL__ statement (extracted
by the almost standard PG parser repackaged as a standalone static library by `libpg_query`__)
as set of interconnected *nodes*, usually called an *abstract syntax tree*.

See a `more detailed introduction`__ in the documentation_.

Installation
------------

As usual, the easiest way is with pip::

  $ pip install pglast

Alternatively you can clone the repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/lelit/pglast.git --recursive

and install from there::

  $ pip install ./pglast


Development
-----------

There is a set of *makefiles* implementing the most common operations, a ``make help`` will
show a brief table of contents. A comprehensive test suite, based on pytest__, covers__ nearly
99% of the source lines.
