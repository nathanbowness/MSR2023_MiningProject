jdemetra-core
=============

 The JDemetra+ core libraries contain all the algorithmic part of the software and numerous peripheral services around time series (access to data providers, formatting...). JDemetra-core doesn't provide any graphical component.

 A large part of the core of JDemetra+ is based on the programs TRAMO-SEATS(+) and X12-ARIMA.

 The program TRAMO-SEATS+ is developed by Gianluca Caporello and Agustin Maravall -with programming support from Domingo Perez and Roberto Lopez- 
 at the Bank of Spain. It is based on the program TRAMO-SEATS, previously developed by Victor Gomez and Agustin Maravall.
 The original software can be downloaded from the following address:

 The program X12-ARIMA was produced by the US-Census Bureau. It can be downloaded from the following address: [https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.html](https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.html)
