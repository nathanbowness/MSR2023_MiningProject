RTAI
====

Welcome to the `master` branch of the RTAI repository!

This branch has many additional features, bug fixes,
performance enhancements, and many other things that
are NOT supported by the official RTAI developers.

This repository does not keep track of RTAI's history before
version 3.9, which is the initial commit of this repository.

Branch `magma` tracks the official CVS branch of the
upstream RTAI repository.  Branch `vulcano` is not tracked, since
it's conceptually a tag on magma.

Please refer to the README.INSTALL file for build instructions.
