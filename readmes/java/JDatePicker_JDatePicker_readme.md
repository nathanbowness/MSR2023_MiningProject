About
-----
This project started in April 2004 before many of the currently available components for date selection of the current day. It was originally developed to be used in a commercial application, therefore a BSD license was a good fit.

The widget has since become quite popular (5 stars on sourceforge & around 370 downloads per week from sf.net). However, there may be many more downloads from the maven central repo, it is hard to guage exactly how many. If your project is using it, let me know and will make a mention on jdatepicker.org.

Way back in the day, sourceforge.net was a popular source code hosting service, it has served its purpose well. I am thankful for the many years of the free service enjoyed there. But since then github.com emerged, with a easier workflow for open source projects. For these reasons the project has finally moved to github.com.

Forks and pull requests are absolutely welcomed. Also please submit issues on the github issue page, this is the preferred way of getting help. 

Older binaries are still available on the maven central repo. Future binary versions will also be distributed there again.

So use it freely and enjoy! You can check for more information at jdatepicker.org.
