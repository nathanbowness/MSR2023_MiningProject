Python plotting utility has been cleaned up and enhanced to allow users more flexibility, and now includes a \"regrid\" function that interpolates output properties onto a lat-lon-pressure grid. Benchmark experiments for acoustic wave and gravity wave behavior have been added (based on Tomita & Satoh 2004). Python code (`tools/thor_ic_gen.py`) has been created that allows the user to \"manually\" edit initial vertical profile. Differential operators are now output to grid file to facilitate post-processing. The code `tools/THORtestrunner.py` has been added as an additional benchmarking tool. A crash report tool has been added to assist in the debugging and development process. See `changelog.md` for additional details."}
