The Python port of cvui has been conceived and developed with the aim of achieving a 1-to-1 match regarding the already existing C++ API. As a consequence, functions and parameters names were kept the same, so existing C++ documentation should apply to Python with minor changes.\r\n\r\n`cvui.py` also aims to be a \"header-only\" file, so all you have to do is add it to your project and you are good to go. Here is a simple example of the Python usage of cvui:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport cv2\r\nimport cvui\r\n\r\nWINDOW_NAME = 'CVUI Test'\r\n\r\ncvui.init(WINDOW_NAME)\r\n\r\n# Create a frame\r\nframe = np.zeros((200, 400, 3), np.uint8)\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\n    # clear the frame\r\n    frame[:] = (49, 52, 49)\r\n\r\n    # render a message in the frame at position (10, 15)\r\n    # then show it on the screen\r\n    cvui.text(frame, 10, 15, 'Hello world!')\r\n    cvui.imshow(WINDOW_NAME, frame)\r\n\r\n    if cv2.waitKey(20) == 27:\r\n        break\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll [code examples](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/examples/) are now also available in Python. The C++ version of cvui makes heavy use of param overloading, which is a problem in Python. To ensure good documentation and proper code auto-completion for cvui in Python IDEs, `cvui.py` has several dummy/wrapping functions. They have a proper list of arguments instead of a single `*args` param. It should provide a good user experience without causing any problems.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to highlight the addition of new [code examples](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/examples/), particularly the `ui-enhanced-*` ones. They show how to improve existing cvui components, e.g. make a window movable and minimizable. Documentation pages have also been tweaked to accommodate information regarding the newly added Python support.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of changes according to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Thank you to all contributors that have helped improve cvui!\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Python implementation of cvui, i.e. `cvui.py` ([read more](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/usage/))\r\n- [Python examples](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/tree/master/example/) ported from the already existing C++ ones.\r\n- New [ui-enhanced-* examples](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/tree/master/example/), e.g. moving settings window ([#41](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/pull/41), [#36](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/pull/36), help from [Amaury Br\u00e9h\u00e9ret](https://github.com/abreheret) and [ShengYu](https://github.com/shengyu7697)).\r\n- Cmake option `ADD_PYTHON_EXAMPLES` to control the build of Python examples ([read more](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/usage/)).\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- [Documentation](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/) tweaks (help from [ShengYu](https://github.com/shengyu7697) and [Akash Kumar Singh](https://github.com/ksakash)).\r\n- Cmake version `3.1` or higher is now required to build the examples.\r\n- Cmake files were improved.\r\n- `rect()` color filling now supports alpha values, e.g. `0x7700ff00` (blue with 50% transparency) ([#39](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/pull/39), help from [Justin Muncaster](https://github.com/jmuncaster)).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- `rect()` issue related to opacity ([#42](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/pull/42), help from [Justin Muncaster](https://github.com/jmuncaster)).\r\n- Conflict with `dirent.h` and `min()/max()` macros on Windows ([#38](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/issues/38), help from [Ali Zarei](https://github.com/AliZ-ee)).\r\n"}

I tried my best to ensure backward compatibility, but unfortunately, a small change is required to make cvui `2.5.0` work with existing projects. I am honestly sorry for any inconveniences this might cause.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, one (**and only one**) of your C++ files must include `cvui.h` after a `#define CVUI_IMPLEMENTATION`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#define CVUI_IMPLEMENTATION\r\n#include \"cvui.h\"\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll other files should include cvui as usual:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"cvui.h\"\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was required to keep cvui as flexible, simple and \"sane\" as possible. The function `cvui::init()` was also modified, but it should not affect existing projects unless they have very specific needs regarding the creation of OpenCV windows. In such case, please read the [multiple OpenCV windows](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/advanced-multiple-windows/) doc page.\r\n\r\nNew features for this release include support for [multiple windows](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/advanced-multiple-windows/), a [mouse API](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/advanced-mouse/) (designed with cvui simplicity in mind) and the addition of `cvui::imshow()` (equivalent of calling `cvui::update()` then `cv::imshow()`, as explained [here](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/advanced-multiple-windows/)).\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to highlight the completely overhauled [documentation](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui) and the addition of several new [code examples](https://dovyski.github.io/cvui/examples/).
