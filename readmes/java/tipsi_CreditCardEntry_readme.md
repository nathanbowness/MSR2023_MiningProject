# Introduction

This library provides an elegant form for credit card entry that can be easily added to a activity or fragment.
Regex is used to validate credit card types and a Luhn check is performed on the card numbers. This form was inspired by the credit entry UI on Square.

 - Smooth interface
 - Identifies credit card type
 - Hides number for privacy
 - Supports VISA, MasterCard, Discover and AMEX

# Including in your project

This project uses [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) to build and release.

Add JitPack to the end of your `repositories`

```
    repositories {

        ...

        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```

Add the project to your `dependencies`

```
    dependencies {

        ...

        compile 'com.github.thefuntasty:CreditCardEntry:1.4.8.4'
    }
```

# Using the library

Please see below for an example.

XML

```
        <com.devmarvel.creditcardentry.library.CreditCardForm
            android:id="@+id/credit_card_form"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            app:helper_text_color="@color/yellow_500"
            app:include_helper="false"
            app:include_zip="false"/>

```

 * `app:text_color` - change the input field's text color (`Color.BLACK` by default).
 * `app:hint_text_color` - change the input field's hint text color (`Color.LTGRAY` by default).
 * `app:cursor_color` - change the input field's cursor color (`Color.BLACK` by default).
 * `app:default_text_colors` - If true, use text colors provided by the app's theme instead of the
   values provided by `app:text_color`,`app:hint_text_color`, and `app:cursor_color`. This overrides
   the values for those three text colors and causes the text inputs to use the colors provided by
   the application's theme.
 * `app:include_helper` - boolean to show/hide the helper text under the widget (`true` by default (i.e. helper is shown))
 * `app:helper_text_color` - change the text color of the hints that appear below the widget by default.
 * `app:include_zip` - boolean to show/hide the zip code in the form (`true` by default (i.e. zip is shown))
 * `app:include_exp` - boolean to show/hide the exp in the form (`true` by default (i.e. exp is shown))
 * `app:include_security` - boolean to show/hide the security code in the form (`true` by default (i.e. security is shown))
 * `app:card_number_hint` - string to put in as a placeholder (hint) in the credit card number field
 * `app:input_background` - the drawable to use as a background (defaults to white square with black 1px border)


In code:

```
    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
  
      private LinearLayout linearLayout;
      private CreditCardForm form;
  
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    	linearLayout = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.layer);
		
        form = new CreditCardForm(this);
    	linearLayout.addView(form);
    	
    	buttonAuthorize = (Button) findViewById(R.id.buttonAuthorize);
    	buttonAuthorize.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    		
    		@Override
    		public void onClick(View arg0) {
    			if(form.isCreditCardValid())
    			{
    				CreditCard card = form.getCreditCard();
    				//Pass credit card to service
    			}
    			else
    			{
    				//Alert Credit card invalid
    			}
    		}
    	});
    }
```
