Reactor Kafka API enables messages to be published to Kafka topics and consumed from Kafka topics using functional APIs with non-blocking back-pressure and very low overheads. This enables applications using Reactor to use Kafka as a message bus or streaming platform and integrate with other systems to provide an end-to-end reactive pipeline.\n\nFor more information and additional resources, see [Reactor Kafka Reference Guide (https://repo.spring.io/milestone/io/projectreactor/kafka/reactor-kafka-docs/1.0.0.M1/reactor-kafka-docs-1.0.0.M1.zip!/docs/index.html).\n"}
