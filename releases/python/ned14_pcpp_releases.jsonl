I took the full day to finish\r\n  the https://github.com/ned14/pcpp/tree/yacc_expression_evaluator branch which is a\r\n  proper C preprocessor expression evaluator based on http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ 's\r\n  yacc module. This was a very long outstanding piece of work which had been in\r\n  progress for nearly two years. It just needed a full day of my time to get it done,\r\n  and now it is indeed done at long last.\r\n- BREAKING CHANGE: Thanks to the new expression evaluator, fix a long standing bug\r\n  where unknown function macros in expressions were parsed as ``0(0)`` which obviously\r\n  enough does not work. Fixing this changes how the ``on_unknown_macro_in_expr()``\r\n  hook works, and there is now an added ``on_unknown_macro_function_in_expr()`` hook.\r\n- Add a new passthru option ``--passthru-includes`` which enables selected ``#include``\r\n  to be passed through, in addition to being executed. Thanks to schra for suggesting\r\n  this, including a PR. The original implementation had some subtle corner case bugs,\r\n  thanks to trelau for reporting those.\r\n- Fix a token expansion ordering bug whereby if a function macro used the same\r\n  macro in more than one argument, expansion in one argument evaluation caused overly\r\n  eager expansion in later argument evaluations. This fix ought to fix pcpp's ability\r\n  to parse Boost (untested). Thanks to joaquintides for reporting this.\r\n- Now that pcpp no longer ever calls ``eval()``, pcpp is PyPy compatible and is\r\n  probably also compatible with Pyston (untested). Typical speedup is about 2.2x-2.3x,\r\n  though it can also be slower occasionally for some inputs. PyPy compatibility is now\r\n  being tested by CI to ensure it remains working going forth.\r\n- Fix internal preprocessor error and failure to insert newlines before ``#include``\r\n  caused by certain sequence of line continuations in a macro. Thanks to dslijepcevic\r\n  for reporting this."}

Thanks to Fondesa for reporting this.\r\n- Fix extra newlines being inserted after a multiline comment. Thanks to virtuald\r\n  for sending a PR fixing this.\r\n- Fix not being able to actually specify an empty line directive. Thanks to kuri65536\r\n  for sending a PR fixing this.\r\n- Update ply submodule to latest from trunk.\r\n- Emit line continuations as tokens, rather than collapsing lines during parsing.\r\n  Thanks to MathieuDuponchelle for the pull request implementing this.\r\n- Enable parsing and emission of files in arbitrary text encodings. This is supported\r\n  in Python 3 or later only. Thanks to MathieuDuponchelle for the suggestion.\r\n- Fix bad regex for parsing floats, so now floats are correctly tokenised. Thanks\r\n  to LynnKirby for reporting this.\r\n- BREAKING CHANGE: Passthrough for ``#include MACRO`` was not supported. This was not\r\n  intentional, and to fix it required modifying the ``on_include_not_found()``\r\n  customisation point which is a source breaking change. Thanks to schra for reporting this.\r\n"}

This includes\r\n  added search paths - files included from those locations will be emitted with a sequence\r\n  of ``../`` to relativise the path emitted.

Thanks to Sei-Lisa for reporting this.\r\n- Add ``--passthru-magic-macros`` command line option.\r\n- BREAKING CHANGE: The ``PreprocessorHooks`` and ``OutputDirective`` interface has\r\n  changed. One now must specify the kind of ``OutputDirective`` abort one wants, and one\r\n  can now both ignore AND remove directives. ``on_directive_handle()`` and\r\n  ``on_directive_unknown()`` now take an extra parameter ``precedingtoks``, these are the\r\n  tokens from the ``#`` up to the directive.\r\n- Fix a corner case where ``FUNC(void)foo()`` expanded to ``voidfoo()`` and not\r\n  ``void foo()`` which is a very common non-conforming extension of the C preprocessor.\r\n  Thanks to OmegaDoom for reporting this.\r\n- Add tokens for all the C operators, to help implementation of an expression evaluator.\r\n- Updated embedded ply to HEAD (2019-04-25)\r\n- Fix ``#include`` not working if no ``-I`` parameters were supplied.
