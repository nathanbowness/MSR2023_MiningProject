When enabled, this policy prevents execing into a Pod (`kubectl exec`) unless an exemption is present :tada: \r\n- **breaking change/bugfix**: #21 introduced validating initContainers in policies that iterate through containers. This means that policies you've already had set for prior releases were skipping initContainers, and upgrading to this release may result in new violations if you are using them.\r\n- **breaking change/bugfix**: Improved resource name extraction in #24. This fixes a bug where Pods created by DaemonSets have an empty resource name (#23 thanks @funkypenguin ). It prioritizes using the controlling resource's name (the one you are likely working with), followed by the (possibly generated) resource name, and then the name label. This change should result in more accurate resource names in most cases, but is possible to be a breaking change for your current exemptions.\r\n- **bugfix**: Fixed `PodSecurityPolicy` compatibility when using `RunAsNonRoot` by switching from named user to numeric user in #19. Thanks @funkypenguin.\r\n- **deprecation**: The [`Safe to Evict`](https://github.com/cruise-automation/k-rail#safe-to-evict) policy has been deprecated in favor of the [`Mutate Safe to Evict`](https://github.com/cruise-automation/k-rail#mutate-safe-to-evict) policy and is now disabled by default in the deployment."}
