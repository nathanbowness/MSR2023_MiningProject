The tracemalloc module is a debug tool to trace memory blocks allocated by
Python. It provides the following information:

* Traceback where an object was allocated
* Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line number:
  total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks
* Compute the differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks
