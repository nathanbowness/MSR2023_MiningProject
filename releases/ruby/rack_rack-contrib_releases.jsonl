Thanks to everyone who made\nPRs, checked PRs, merged PRs, and... renewed PRs.  Special thanks to Andrew Konchin\n(@andrykonchin) who is responsible for over half the changes in this monster release,\nand who has come on board as a maintainer.\n\nThis release removes the `Rack::Runtime` and `Rack::Config` middleware.\nThis may seem like a foolhardy thing to do in a minor release, but `rack`\nitself ships with functionally identical versions.  Compatibility\nhas been maintained by having `require \"rack/contrib/<thing>\"` still work, but\nthat should be changed to `require \"rack/<thing>\"` instead.\n\n* A `#close` method was added to the body that is returned by `Rack::Signals`.\n* A stub `CHANGELOG.md`, pointing to the canonical source of release notes, has\n  been added.\n\n* Thread safety issues in `Rack::Access`, `Rack::CommonCookies`, and `Rack::Deflect`\n  have been fixed.  Additionally, the need for a thread-safe external cache object in\n  `Rack::LazyConditionalGet` has been documented.\n* A SPEC violation in `Rack::CSSHTTPRequest` has been fixed.\n* Case-sensitive header problems in a whole bunch of middlewares have been fixed.\n* `Rack::JSONBodyParser` now only rescues `JSON::ParserError` if it is raised within\n  the middleware's own code.  Exceptions raised by the application itself will now\n  be left alone to be handled elsewhere.\n\n* All string literals are now frozen.\n* Residual ye olde Ruby compatibility checks were removed from `Rack::Backstage`,\n  `Rack::MailExceptions` and `Rack::NestedParams`.\n* The length calculation in `Rack::JSONP` has been made simpler."}

Thanks to\r\neveryone who contributed, and welcome to Andrew Konchin, as the newest\r\nrecipient of a commit bit.\r\n\r\n* New middleware `Rack::JSONBodyParser`: a better-designed replacement for\r\n  `Rack::PostBodyContentTypeParser`, with a more appropriate name (given\r\n  that they both only handle JSON natively, having `JSON` in the name seems\r\n  like a good idea), and with a better set of default behaviours and knobs.\r\n  It is also *significantly* faster than `PostBodyContentTypeParser`.\r\n\r\n* **`Rack::PostBodyContentTypeParser`**: this middleware's interface is a\r\n  bit of a mess, which makes it nearly impossible to improve in a\r\n  backwards-compatible manner.  As a result, its use has been deprecated, in\r\n  favour of `Rack::JSONBodyParser`.\r\n\r\n* Several middlewares that set `Content-Length` headers were fixed to use\r\n  `String#bytesize`, instead of `String#size`, which makes multibyte characters\r\n  much happier.  (Chris Frank)\r\n\r\n* `Rack::ResponseCache`: Make header detection case-insensitive.  (Chris Frank)\r\n\r\n* A lot of broken tests and deprecation warnings in the test suite were\r\n  fixed.  (Andrew Konchin)\r\n\r\n* `Rack::Locale`: significant correctness fixes, including `q=0` handling,\r\n  case insensitivity where appropriate, and better handling of whitespace.\r\n  (Andrew Konchin)\r\n\r\n* `Rack::StaticCache`: several correctness fixes, such as setting a `Date`\r\n  response header, use UTC in timestamps, and improving the robustness of\r\n  the date rendering.\r\n\r\nShare and enjoy!"}

Using this middleware will now result in a\n  deprecation warning being printed to `stderr`.  If you use this\n  middleware, now would be a good time to start doing things properly.\n\n# Features\n- `Rack::LazyConditionalGet`: new middleware, by\n  [Mig](https://github.com/mig-hub).  This middleware tracks when the last\n  POST/PUT/DELETE request was made, and returns 304 responses to requests\n  which include a `Last-Modified` entity request header which is greater\n  than or equal to that time.\n- `Rack::StaticCache`: You can now specify a custom \"version\" regex for your\n  cache invalidation, if the default doesn't do it for you.  Initial patch\n  provided by [Eric Boehs](https://github.com/ericboehs).\n- `Rack::Profiler`: You can now run a single request through the profiler\n  multiple times, by adding the `profiler_runs` query parameter to the URL.\n  Patch provided by [Bryce McDonnell](https://github.com/brycemcd).\n"}
