This was achieved by replacing `self.connect()` patterns with a `requires_connection` decorator, which only lazily checks the connection.\r\n- Expose a wrapper around all Omniduct `FileSystemClient` implementations for use with `pyarrow` as `_.pyarrow_fs`.\r\n- Fix serialization of `pandas` dataframes when using filehandles.\r\n- Improve the robustness of cached methods when the serializer fails to serialize (or deserialize) objects.\r\n- `FileSystemFile` fixes and improvements:\r\n  - Fix a `seek` implementation bug whereby `whence` was not passed through to the internal buffer.\r\n  - Fix the spelling of the `writable` attribute: \"writeable\" -> \"writable\"\r\n  - Add a few extra methods to the API to match that offered by `io` file implementations.\r\n- `S3Client` fixes and improvements:\r\n  - Fix enumerating root \"directory\".\r\n  - Add support for passing in a pre-configured boto3 session.\r\n  - Refactor class to allow for subclasses to override boto3 session generation.\r\n"}

Subclasses that override methods defined on a parent class must now explicitly annotate those method declarations with `interface_meta.override()`. Any downstream subclasses will have to conform to these changes also.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- `FilesystemClient`s can now have the home directory specified at instantiation or overridden at runtime, and can now be configured to be read only.\r\n- `DatabaseClient`s now propagate the instantiation-time schema/database/etc namespace configuration as defaults to utility methods (such as `table_desc`, `table_list`, etc).\r\n\r\nBugfixes and improvements:\r\n- SQLAlchemy schema exploration extensions are now more dialog agnostic (#93)\r\n- The 'replace' operation for the `DatabaseClient.query_to_table` method has been fixed for Presto and HiveServer2.\r\n- REST client logging now renders JSON error responses rather than simply showing a string representation."}

[Users of omniduct v0.9.6 and earlier will need to adjust their use of `DuctRegistry` appropriately.\r\n- Added a `show_about` utility function to simplify showing of information about the Omniduct package (or dependent packages), providing the option to \"endorse\" Omniduct or other significant dependencies.\r\n- Included the new Omniduct logo, which you can feel free to use to endorse Omniduct in your own work.\r\n- Extended documentation coverage to all user-facing classes and methods, and improved the consistency of documentation conventions.\r\n- Added an example company/organisation-specific Omniduct configuration wrapper to assist with the bootstrapping of such wrappers.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n - Avoid use of `_file_read` in `download` in case the `_open` method was overloaded by clients, as in `LocalFsClient`."}
