Thanks go to karnevil9 for sticking with this one.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are is a new thread responsible for sending MIDI events out to listeners. Previously, data from ALSA devices was read into a buffer and then parsed down to each MIDI event. Once that data was parsed, the events were sent out. With this new thread, as each MIDI event is discovered, it will be written to a queue for the new thread to send immediately.\r\n\r\nI've also rationalised the amount of thread locking to avoid contention.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are a couple of new configuration options:\r\n\r\n**journal.write**\r\nIf set to *yes* it will enable the MIDI recovery journal. The default is no.\r\n\r\n**logging.hex_dump**\r\nIf set to *yes*, data buffers are dumped out to the debug log. This can slow performance for large data buffers. The default is no.\r\n\r\nFinally, for debugging, additional logging can be generated for each memory allocation and release. An environment variable **RAVELOXMIDI_MEM_FILE** can be set to the name of a file to log the extra information into. This should only be enabled on request."}

All the example scripts in the python/ directory have been corrected for that.\r\n\r\n### remote.use_control has been renamed\r\nThe setting **remote.use_control**  has changed to **remote.use_control_for_ck**\r\nThe functionality remains the same but I wanted the setting name to be more descriptive.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Multiple ALSA input or output devices\r\nYou can specify multiple ALSA input or output devices in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nFor example, if there is a parameter called **alsa.output_device** you can use either:\r\n```\r\nalsa.output_device = device_name\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n```\r\nalsa.output_device.0 = first_device\r\nalsa.output_device.1 = second_device\r\n```\r\nA multi-value configuration option must start at index 0 and parsing will stop when there is a break in the sequence. That is, if the values are 0,1,3,4,5 then only 0 and 1 will be detected.\r\n\r\n### Command set for local port\r\nThe code has been in for a long while but raveloxmidi provides a simple set of commands for shutdown, heartbeat and connection status. \r\n\r\nThe commands can only be received on the local listening port ( default is 5006 ). The commands are:\r\n\r\n**STAT**\r\nThis is the heartbeat command. The response will always be *OK* if raveloxmidi is running. The script **python/send_stat.py** is available for this command.\r\n\r\n**QUIT**\r\nThis will shut down raveloxmidi. The response will always be *QT* to indicate that the command has been received. The script **python/send_quit.py** is available for this command.\r\n\r\n**LIST**\r\nThis requests a lists of current connections into raveloxmidi. The response will be a JSON blob of information. The script **python/send_list.py** is available for this command.\r\n\r\nThe JSON data looks like this:\r\n```\r\n~/pimidi/python$ ./send_list.py | python -m json.tool\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"connections\": [\r\n        {       \r\n            \"control\": 5004,\r\n            \"ctx\": \"0x556d380bac30\",\r\n            \"data\": 5005,\r\n            \"host\": \"192.168.1.145\",\r\n            \"id\": 0,\r\n            \"initiator\": \"0x19495cff\",\r\n            \"send_ssrc\": \"0x2dfec3cc\",\r\n            \"seq\": 1,\r\n            \"ssrc\": \"0x4181a596\",\r\n            \"start\": 15861082588188,\r\n            \"status\": \"idle\"\r\n        }       \r\n    ],\r\n    \"count\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'll be working on also including the ALSA devices in a future update.\r\n\r\nTo parse the data, the *count* field will be the number of connections in the list. The connections array holds each connection. The *id* field in the connections array is an internal id for the array. The value of that field *may* change. It is recommended that you use the *ssrc* field as the uniq identifier for the connection.\r\n\r\n### New setting **alsa.writeback**\r\n\r\nIf a MIDI command is received from an inbound ALSA device, this option controls whether that event is written to an ALSA output device if it has the same card number.\r\nThis is a yes/no option. Default is no.\r\n\r\nThere is also an associated setting **alsa.writeback.level** which can be either \"card\" (hw:X,*,*) or \"device\" (hw:X,Y,*) ( default is \"card\" ). This determines the level that the writeback prevention operates.\r\n\r\n### New setting \"read.ring_buffer_size\"\r\n\r\nThis is more of an internal setting but it controls the space available for reading data from input connections or devices. The default ( and minimum ) is 10K ( 10240 bytes ).\r\n\r\n### Log entries now include microseconds (usecs)\r\n\r\nAs I've added threads for extra functionality, I needed microsecond resolution in the debug logs so I can see when specific events are occurring,"}

The original implementation was expecting a full MIDI command in each read and so was coded so that the local socket data was always prefixed by a 0xaa identifier byte. \r\n\r\nI was sharing code to parse local data socket data and also ALSA rawmidi data. In the case of rawmidi, I was faking the 0xaa prefix.\r\n\r\nWhere the data is in chunks, that 0xaa byte was injected in the middle of a MIDI command and that caused infernal loops and memory exhaustion.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I had to remove the need for the 0xaa identifier byte.\r\n\r\nThis means if you have code which is sending the 0xaa byte, you will need to remove it. I apologise for the incovenience but there wasn't a way around it.\r\n\r\nAddtionally in this release, big thanks go to Michael Ganss for spending some time to investigate and address some code analysis items. The first few of his suggestions have been incorporated into this release."}
