All optimization algorithms included in `mystic` provide workflow at the fitting layer, not just access to the algorithms as function calls. `mystic` gives the user fine-grained power to both monitor and steer optimizations as the fit processes are running. Optimizers can advance one iteration with `Step`, or run to completion with `Solve`.  Users can customize optimizer stop conditions, where both compound and user-provided conditions may be used. Optimizers can save state, can be reconfigured dynamically, and can be restarted from a saved solver or from a results file.  All solvers can also leverage parallel computing, either within each iteration or as an ensemble of solvers. Optimization algorithms in `mystic` can accept parameter constraints, either in the form of penaties (which \"penalize\" regions of solution space that violate the constraints), or as constraints (which \"constrain\" the solver to only search in regions of solution space where the constraints are respected), or both. `mystic` provides a large selection of constraints, including probabistic and dimensionally reducing constraints.
