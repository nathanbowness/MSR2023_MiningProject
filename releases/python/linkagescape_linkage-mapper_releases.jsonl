Two considerations have previously been modeled in isolation from each other, and yield quite different recommendations for linkage priority. However, we discovered that they are two ends of the same continuous framework, and Linkage Mapper Version 3.0.0 allows the user to model for one, or the other, or an appropriate blend between both (which we recommend). The first consideration is \u201crange shift connectivity\u201d, and gives linkages a higher priority for conservation if they are predicted to connect a core area that might become too hot/dry in the future with a core that is expected to be much cooler/wetter. The other is \u201cclimate analog connectivity\u201d giving higher priority to linkages with the destination core having the same predicted climate at a future time (e.g. 2050), as the climate in the source core at the current time. We also added \u201cpreferred climate\u201d as an optional parameter in differentiating among destination cores.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
