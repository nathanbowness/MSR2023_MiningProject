= Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis

IMPORTANT: This project has been moved as a module to https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] starting with its version `4.0.0`.
From now on it is recommended to create Kinesis binder-specific issues over there in Spring Cloud Stream. 

This repository contains the code for the Spring Cloud Stream Binder implementation for AWS Kinesis.

See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-aws-kinesis/blob/main/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis-docs/src/main/asciidoc/overview.adoc[AWS Kinesis Binder Reference Manual] for more information.
