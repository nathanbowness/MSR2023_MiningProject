Previously map/reduce slots would be launched via TaskTrackers when new jobs are submitted, and over time on a busy cluster the ratio of map/reduce slots could get slightly skewed and be less than ideal, often resulting in idle map/reduce slots. More details of related issues can be seen in #32 and #33.\n- Idle TaskTrackers #33\n"}
