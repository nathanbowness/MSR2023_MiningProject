android-transcoder
=================

Hardware accelerated transcoder for Android, written in pure Java.

## Why?

Android does not offer straight forward way to transcode video.

FFmpeg is the most famous solution for transcoding. But using [FFmpeg binary on Android](https://github.com/WritingMinds/ffmpeg-android) can cause GPL and/or patent issues. Also using native code for Android development can be troublesome because of cross-compiling, architecture compatibility, build time and binary size.

To transcode without any hassle written above, I created this library to provide hardware accelerated transcoding of H.264 (mp4) video without ffmpeg by using [MediaCodec](https://developer.android.com/intl/ja/reference/android/media/MediaCodec.html).

## Requirements

API Level 18 (Android 4.3, JELLY_BEAN_MR2) or later.
If your app targets older Android, you should add below line to AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<!-- Only supports API >= 18 -->
<uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary="net.ypresto.androidtranscoder" />
```

Please ensure checking Build.VERSION by your self.

## Usage

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    ParcelFileDescriptor parcelFileDescriptor = resolver.openFileDescriptor(data.getData(), "r");
    FileDescriptor fileDescriptor = parcelFileDescriptor.getFileDescriptor();
    MediaTranscoder.Listener listener = new MediaTranscoder.Listener() {
        @Override
        public void onTranscodeProgress(double progress) {
            ...
        }

        @Override
        public void onTranscodeCompleted() {
            startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW).setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), "video/mp4"));
            ...
        }

        @Override
        public void onTranscodeFailed(Exception exception) {
            ...
        }
    };
    MediaTranscoder.getInstance().transcodeVideo(fileDescriptor, file.getAbsolutePath(),
            MediaFormatStrategyPresets.createAndroid720pStrategy(), listener); // or createAndroid720pStrategy([your bitrate here])
}
```

See `TranscoderActivity.java` in example directory for ready-made transcoder app.

## Quick Setup

### Gradle

Available from [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter), which is default repo of gradle script generated by recent android studio.

```groovy
repositories {
   jcenter()
}
```

```groovy
compile 'net.ypresto.androidtranscoder:android-transcoder:0.2.0'
```

## Note (PLEASE READ FIRST)

- This library raises `RuntimeException`s (like `IlleagalStateException`) in various situations. Please catch it and provide alternate logics. I know this is bad design according to Effective Java; just is TODO.
- Currently this library does not generate streaming-aware mp4 file.
Use [qtfaststart-java](https://github.com/ypresto/qtfaststart-java) to place moov atom at beginning of file.
- Android does not gurantees that all devices have bug-free codecs/accelerators for your codec parameters (especially, resolution). Refer [supported media formats](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html) for parameters guaranteed by [CTS](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts-intro.html).
- This library does not support video files recorded by other device like digital cameras, iOS (mov files, including non-baseline profile h.264), etc.


## More information about internals

There is a blog post about this library written in Japanese.

While it is Japanese, diagrams would be useful for understanding internals of this library.
