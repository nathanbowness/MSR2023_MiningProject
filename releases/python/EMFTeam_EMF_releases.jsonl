Combine it with other customizations such as the day-1 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action, 'Feudalize Tribes,' or 'No CB Cooldowns.'\n  - Unless you choose otherwise, players always get preference over AI rulers for de jure duke/king selection.\n  - AI de jure duke / king random selection preference is first for current/previous de jure rulers (if the player so chooses), and whenever there was no preexisting de jure ruler, feudal > tribal > republic > theocracy.\n  - All affected rulers surrender all but their capital province to local province barons, even in de jure dukes / kings modes. However, when in de jure dukes / kings modes, starting rulers get strong, pressed claims on the counties that they surrendered.\n  - If an AI ruler's starting capital is not the province in their demesne with the most holdings, they will move their capital to their best demesne province before surrendering their extra counties. Player capitals are never automatically relocated.\n  - When in de jure kings mode on the VANILLA map, de jure duchies will be auto-distributed to vassals whose capital is a given duchy's de jure capital. [Avoids vassal limit bootstrapping issues.]\n  - When in de jure kings mode on the SWMH map, due to a major SWMH limitation, the above will be the case for some kingdoms (or selected duchies within them) but, otherwise, the remainder/all of the duchies in a kingdom will be given to their de jure king for manual distribution.\n  - NWO replaces Shattered Balance:\n    - The old \"Rapid Conquest\" CBs from Shattered Balance have been retrofitted (albeit lightly) and are now rid of a number of old bugs (e.g., no more usurpation of the Ecumenical Patriarchy, Papal State, or other weirdness).\n    - No more support for the \"immortals\" option (sorry! EMF must politely insist on your death-- as many times as possible!)\n- **[Scenario Customization Decision] Feudalize Tribes**\n  - This scenario customization decision allows you to instantly feudalize all tribes.\n  - Also, it automatically builds a random but plausible distribution of additional castle, city, and temple holdings within the once-tribal provinces.\n  - Want a slice of what Russia or any other such now-tribal region used to be like in 1066 or 867, before the map changes due to Charlemagne? Here you go.\n- _Dynamic Flags:_\n  - For certain titles, the CoA for the title will be automatically adjusted according to certain dynamic rules (currently based upon holder culture and dynasty)\n  - NOTE: Flags will only be updated immediately upon title inheritance, usurpation, creation, and on scenario startup. Otherwise, any other changes may take up to 2 years to be reflected.\n  - For the [Christian] Kingdom of England:\n    - If the holder is a de Normandie, Plantagenet, or Norman-cultured, the Plantagenet Lions will be used\n    - If the holder is Saxon-cultured, the Saxon Dragon will be used\n    - If none of the above, the Cross of St. George will be used\n  - For the Kingdom of Aragon:\n    - If the holder is a de Barcelona, the dynasty's classic heraldry will be used\n    - Otherwise, the default flag will be used\n- Previously defunct decision to 'Bring Child Home' restored in the form of a same-named diplo-action & special action alert: Kids in the wrong court (but not prisoners)? Bring 'em home.\n- (EMF+SWMH) Starting forces of the Normans, Saxons, and Norwegians in the Stamford Bridge start rebalanced\n- When negotiating to drop decadence (\"straighten-up\"), Ibadi/Kharijite targets now have a choice to join the Haruriyyah holy order like Shia/Sunni muslims do (vanilla omission)\n- Magyars no longer spawn additional event troops when they take the decision 'Create Hungary'\n- Magyar settlement event upon taking the decision 'Create Hungary' rewritten to be more robust and always find an appropriate ruler(s) to take the old Steppe holdings of the Magyars\n- SPECIAL_TROOPS_GRAPHICAL_FACTOR reduced to 4 from 20; players should see a lot fewer camels and horse archers on the map (and will see Byzantine Cataphract models with the right DLC)\n- Decision menu toggle state is now inherited upon player character death rather than resetting for each new character\n- 'Conscript Merchant Ships' decision no longer shows at top of decisions menu unless actually at war\n- AI tribals can now also use 'Raise Tribal Army' decision (spend prestige for a fixed-size mercenary unit while at war)\n- _Distribute Recently Acquired Land:_\n  - As options for a county grant, decision no longer shows prisoners that are otherwise \"best-fit\" characters\n  - Localisation of \"best-fit\" character options now includes their name (as well as their clickable portrait) and no longer suggests they're from your court (might be a vassal)\n- Higher-skilled chancellors no longer have a chance to fabricate a duchy claim if the targeted duchy is held by a merchant republic and it's their capital duchy\n- Natural death chances at ages 60-100 are now higher\n- Bishops now pay only 5% of their normal tax to an anti-pope if they are loyal to him rather than their liege (down from 10%, which is the amount the real Pope receives)\n- DOW_AGGRESSION_FACTOR raised to 0.6 from vanilla 0.5; the AI will be 20% more likely than vanilla to wage war when it has sufficient conditions (a CB, adequate troop ratio, etc.)\n- FIX: Rulers should no longer be converting to Judaism due to courtiers\n- FIX: Decision to 'Go on Hajj' for Muslims now works without the WoL theology focus\n- FIX: Isis can no longer be seduced\n- VANILLA FIX: Invalid Papacy claims (generated due to papal succession bug) cleared routinely to prevent wanton antipapacies\n- VANILLA FIX: 'Antiking Faction' CB and 'Depose Antipope' CB now have a workaround for the vanilla bug that's been rendering them useless since patch 2.3\n- VANILLA FIX: Removed 3 invalid vanilla event references from on_actions (could potentially cause random behavior, although none has been observed)\n"}

Similarly, note that you also cannot build trade posts until immediately after unpausing the game (day 2).\n  - Cool extra, related feature: there is now a special 'Convert to Merchant Republic' diplo-action available upon essentially any coastal feudal ruler (but only before unpausing the game). With this diplo-action, you can create AI merchant republics-- and still choose whether they're de jure kingdom-tier or simple duke-tier-- wherever you damn well please all over the map.\n- **[Scenario Customization Decision] No CB Cooldowns**\n  - You may now choose whether to disable all CB \"cooldowns\" (for all rulers) before unpausing via the decisions menu (affects holy war, county conquest, republics, subjugation, tribal invasion, etc.)\n  - Can be enacted at any time but is currently irreversible once enacted\n- _More Crown Authority, More Money_\n  - All non-default increments of crown authority laws now grant an additional +2.5% feudal, city, and clergy tax. This can add up very quickly, especially for feudal tax in large realms.\n  - If you can set legal precedent in favor of the crown on any subject (protected inheritance, internal king's peace, etc.), it is reasonable to expect that the same crown would be able to require / demand slightly higher taxes, ceteris paribus. Naturally, raising crown authority also reduces vassal opinion and may put you at risk of revolts (just as always), so the pay-off isn't fundamental.\n  - This makes pursuing centralization of power with the crown a more lucrative business, if nothing else. While each crown law has always had its strategic benefits, it has never been more clear that centralization of power with the crown is, in essence, _theoretically_ good for the crown.\n  - Now perhaps you can finally afford those shiny retinues in order to crush the consequent rebellions of disempowered nobles! [ More work to be done soon on better rebellions, though! ]\n- _Distribute Recently Acquired Land_\n  - Decision now also works for counties acquired through inheritance\n  - Cosmetic improvements (some automatically-generated tooltips were misleading, and a [wrong] character portrait was shown in the main province-prompt event under certain conditions)\n  - Once decision is taken, it will now prompt for the full set of recently-acquired counties and no longer stop once your character is no longer over their demesne limit. Simply choose not to grant what you want to keep, and remember, even if it's recently-acquired, you'll never be prompted about anything in your capital duchy.\n  - Now also searches your court for up to 2 best-fit candidates for each province and allows the option to select one of these instead of a new, random character when prompting for each province\n  - Now applies the proper Indian caste trait to newly-created characters, if relevant\n  - Newly-created characters will have a stewardship education rather than a fully-random education\n  - Vanilla's 'Ask For Help Managing Titles' decision is now disabled unless your chancellor is another player; EMF's decision is safer and more reliable\n- _Ruler Designer Unlocked_\n  - There is now no need to use external mods such as \"Ruler Designer Unlocked!\" with EMF (no age costs).\n  - You can add whatever traits to your character that you please and set whatever character properties that you like. Ruler-design responsibly, _ahem_.\n  - You may customize your age exactly from 16-79 with any combination of the 6 age customizer traits in the Ruler Designer (+1 year, +2 years, +4 years, ..., +32 years). These \"age traits\" are removed from your character within a few days of unpausing your game.\n- Great Goddess Isis of Duat now has her very own sexy portrait set and a proper Ancient Egyptian religion icon (**portrait art thanks to Crakdtoothgrin!**)\n- AI rulers won't use de jure county claims, de jure duchy claims, or third-party de jure county claims to conquer AI merchant republics' capitals unless they are themselves another merchant republic and not part of the same greater realm\n- AI decision to seduce as well as tendency to pick the seduction focus has been yet further nerfed\n- When using the Pagan Subjugation CB, it is now only necessary to share a border with the enemy in the target kingdom-- not to actually be landed within the target kingdom too (plus some other changes)\n- Independence Faction is less likely to jump the gun on ultimatums at relatively low faction power ratios\n- [Ambition] Disabled Find Hobby ambition when Way of Life DLC is active; Find Hobby is not currently compatible with the Way of Life lifestyle trait distribution method\n- OPTIMIZED: Dynamic levy efficiency laws are now only applied to a ruler's primary title rather than all primary-tier titles and should automatically copy whenever their primary title changes (plus other optimizations)\n- OPTIMIZED/FIXED: AI no longer uses employment decisions to randomly spawn courtiers of various types, as in vanilla-- far fewer random courtiers will be spawned and may fix a stability issue\n- FIX: Religious Reconquest now, like standard Holy War, allows Reformed Norse to wage war over sea zones\n- FIX: Bulgarian Empire title creation conditions now consistent with other empire titles (minimum realm size of 120)\n- FIX: AI Lucky Rulers are no longer subject to trait restrictions when attempting to use the Pagan Subjugation CB _outside_ their capital de jure kingdom (same restrictions as players)\n- FIX: The Autonomy Faction's remove_internal_peace CB had 3 on_add sections (duplicate); it now has one, as it should\n- MINOR: Vassal AIs must be king-tier or higher to fabricate claims outside their realm; however, vassal duke AIs may do so as well if the target realm's top liege is a player (like previously)\n- MINOR: All councillor ambitions use expectation_of_liege = yes to hint the AI\n"}

The other custom republics, with the exception of those in the Indian Ocean, were largely no longer functional after patch 2.2 (Charlemagne) in any case.\n  - Rather than add more custom merchant republics statically, a scenario customization decision is being considered to enable dynamic merchant republic creation/conversion in-game wherever desired (coastal only).\n  - Nevertheless, more custom merchant republics may still be added yet.\n- Succession laws:\n  - Forced the HRE to stick with feudal elective succession for AI emperors (though succession law factions can still form and force a change)\n  - Opinion modifiers further tweaked for the available feudal succession types to improve balance and worthwhile strategic diversity. Notable changes:\n    - Regular gavelkind is now the most attractive from a vassal- and dynasty-opinion standpoint (and its +30% demesne bonus).\n    - Primogeniture is not without its sacrifices.\n    - Seniority is now significantly more viable than previously. Consider trying this some time if you haven't, especially if you're breaking out of a tribal or gavelkind situation with many disparate titles held by separate dynasty members.\n    - Feudal elective no longer awards vassal opinion, as this is frankly a nonsensical CK2 tradition. If de jure elector vassals were an opinion class that could be targeted by law, then it could make sense to award _only them_ opinion. However, this is not possible, and even so, the case for any bonus is still weak for a feudal elective title, a title whose constituent de jure electoral titles' consensus upon succession is fundamentally more legitimate than all hereditary claim to it. [If anything, elective lieges ought to think slightly higher of their de jure elector vassals (the reverse).]\n      - Expect more changes regarding feudal elective in the future to reduce its potential for abuse and more appropriately model the legal/philosophical implications of such a law.\n  - Removed some vestigial references to the believed-no-longer-necessary 'Decentralized HRE' law in succession law requirements\n"}

You can always remove Lucky Ruler status at will with this new diplomacy action.\n- Muslim County Conquest: AI restrictions for usage when an inter-religion war greatly lessened (player usage unaffected)\n- Warrior/Fighter traits now factor into WoL personal duel system and their bonuses were tweaked a bit\n- **Defines (variables which factor into various base game formulae) changes:**\n  - Holding levy sizes now half as influenced by the martial stat of the particular holding owner (HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_MULT = 0.75, HOLDING_LEVY_SIZE_OWNER_MARTIAL_BASE = 0.025)\n  - Nobles are more likely to choose to personally command their soldiers when a liege raises their levies (OPINION_WHEN_MARSHAL_INSTEAD_OF_SELF = 0)\n  - Vassals will no longer provide any liege levies at all when their liege opinion is below -50 (MIN_LEVY_RAISE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = -50)\n  - Vassals will provide a minimum of 25% of their liege levy obligation at the new -50 liege opinion threshold for levies (with linear scaling above the threshold). E.g., -100 to -49 opinion nets 0% levies, -50 opinion nets 25% levies, 0 opinion nets 50% levies, 25 opinion nets 62.5% levies, 50 opinion nets 75% levies, and so on (MIN_LEVIES_ABOVE_OPINION_THRESHOLD = 0.25)\n  - When unloading troops (e.g., raiders) from a galley, it now takes twice as long as previously, so it's now the same as vanilla (ARMY_UNLOAD_MOVE_COST = 20.0)\n  - When loading troops (e.g., raiders) back into galleys (when the ships are not in port), it now takes twice as long as it did for them to unload (ARMY_LOAD_MOVE_COST = 40.0)\n  - Capturing the heir of your enemy during a war is now \"only\" worth 30% warscore instead of 50% (CAPTURED_HEIR_WAR_SCORE = 30.0)\n  - While levy reinforce rates are the same (4%/yr base), vassals' reinforcement of their liege levy contribution reinforces 25% more slowly than their personal levy (LIEGE_LEVY_REINF_RATE = 0.03)\n  - Vassals pay 20% less for levy maintenance when the levies are raised by a liege rather than the vassal personally (LIEGE_LEVY_COST_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)\n  - Viceroys (including minor/duke viceroys) provide 20% less liege levies, ceteris paribus-- now the same as vanilla (LIEGE_LEVY_VICE_ROYALTY_MULTIPLIER = 0.8)\n  - During civil wars, the revolt leader will be able to raise more troops than normal from his fellow revolters (REBEL_LEADER_MINIMUM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 1.25)\n  - More severe penalties to liege levy contributions depending upon how far they are away from the liege's capital. Strict distance is not used for these penalties; instead, \"concentric rings\" of decreasingly-concentrated de jure territory tiers with respect to the liege's capital county are used. EMF was (and still is) much less severe in these penalties than vanilla because of its additional 'dynamic levies' (or, 'dynlevy') mechanic which also scales down effective liege levies with realm size. However, some adjustments were in order to better achieve EMF's goals:\n    - CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1 (was 1.15)\n    - CAPITAL_KINGDOM_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.8 (was 0.9)\n    - CAPITAL_EMPIRE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.8)\n    - OUTSIDE_LIEGE_LEVY_MULT = 0.5 (was 0.7, now no extra penalty for your capital being in an area of the map with no de jure empire-- also just a lot less arbitrary)\n  - Weakened medium-to-large lieges' levy potential when spreading development over their entire capital duchy rather than concentrating on their capital county; there are still major levy bonuses for capital county, now neither bonus nor penalty for capital duchy, and appropriately-varying penalties elsewhere (CAPITAL_DUCHY_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.25, CAPITAL_DUCHY_VASSAL_LEVY_MULT = 1-- was 1.15)\n  - Some strategic notes:\n    - One still has every incentive to completely control their capital duchy (i.e., all province capitals) in order to maximize tax income due to more vassal barons. If your capital county has a lot of capacity and your demesne limit is scarce, the trade-off between maximum taxes (spread yourself over duchy) and levies (pump capital full of castles) is your choice to make. Also consider that retinues are very expensive but have obvious military advantages over levies.\n    - Keep in mind that the aforementioned, dramatic capital county levy bonuses (as well as the de jure tier liege levy penalties) apply to EVERY ruler-- not just you; therefore, it is extremely beneficial to total realm levy power to maximize the demesne efficiency of all your vassals by ideally limiting every ruler in your realm to a single county (regardless of tier).\n    - Viking raiding parties now face more serious risks, as they cannot instantly escape the moment you send an army their way. When raiding as a Viking, you're going to need to use more realistic tactics and target selection to plunder and pillage with the best.\n    - Capital selection matters a lot. Don't be afraid to move your capital. Unless you happen to start with an ideal capital, you should probably move your court at least once. In some areas of the map or upon major conquests/inheritances, it may be beneficial to do so a number of times. Remember, the de jure setup around the capital is critical-- not just the province and encompassing duchy.\n    - Be more wary of overextending your realm territorially. Upon reaching monumental sizes, something to consider would be spinning-off independent kingdoms that will aid you more efficiently in war.\n- FIX: Automatic empire disintegration should no longer create titular kingdoms when searching for a valid king-level title for the emperor upon which to fallback\n- FIX: Pagan holy war now costs only 200 piety the first time and then 300 piety thereafter (was costing 500 piety instead)\n- FIX: You may now properly press third-party (for a vassal) de jure claims on counties and baronies against different-religion holy orders\n- FIX: Peace pledge ambition is now properly enforced by third-party claim CBs (cannot even attempt to press de jure claims or regular claims for a subject character while peace pledge is active)\n- MINOR: AI now actually always prefers to 'Press All Claims' rather than press them individually\n- MINOR: Eliminated needless exceptions for Byzantium & Roman Empire from all 5 de jure claim CBs' tooltips\n"}
