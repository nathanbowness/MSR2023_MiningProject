Usage
-----
The simplest use is by using it as a context manager:

::

    with NonBlockingLock.objects.acquire_lock(obj=model_obj):
        model_obj.do_something()

Or you can keep track of the lock yourself:

::

    try:
        lock = NonBlockingLock.objects.acquire_lock(obj=model_obj)
    except AlreadyLocked:
        return False

    model_obj.do_something()
    lock.release()

If you have no Django model, or you want to be able to specify the lock name
yourself, you can do that too::

    # this will raise AlreadyLocked, if it's locked
    lock = NonBlockingLock.objects.acquire_lock(lock_name='my_lock')
    do_something()
    lock.release()

Note that locks can expire automatically. There is a `LOCK_MAX_AGE` settings where you can specify a default lock release value for locks in your entire Django codebase. This value can be overridden per lock by setting the `max_age` parameter.

Test
-----
You can run the tests with
::

    tox
