reporting severities in Trivy v0.7.0. Trivy v0.6.0 used the severity from NVD, but v0.7.0 uses the severity from a vendor such as Red Hat and Debian. The NVD severity is the generic one, but vendors usually provide more accurate measures. The number of vulnerabilities is not supposed to be different though.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nb063d5f release: Prepare v0.10.0 (#112)\r\nea2537f fix: Handle gracefully scratch and slim images (#111)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Docker images\r\n\r\n- `docker pull docker.io/aquasec/harbor-scanner-trivy:0.10.0`\r\n"}
