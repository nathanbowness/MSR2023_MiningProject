## Description

Roodi stands for Ruby Object Oriented Design Inferometer. It parses your Ruby code and warns you about design issues you have based on the checks that it has configured.

## Install

Open your terminal and type this:

`$ gem install roodi`

Alternatively, you can put it in your Gemfile:

`gem "roodi"`

## Synopsis

To check one or more files using the default configuration that comes with Roodi, use:

`$ roodi [-config=file] [pattern ...]`

## Example Usage

Check all ruby files recursively under the current directory:

`$ roodi` or `$ roodi .`

Check all ruby files in a rails app:

`$ roodi "rails_app/**/*.rb"`

Check one controller and one model file in a rails app:

`$ roodi app/controller/sample_controller.rb app/models/sample.rb`

Check one controller and all model files in a rails app:

`$ roodi app/controller/sample_controller.rb "app/models/*.rb"`

Check all ruby files in a rails app with a custom configuration file:

`$ roodi -config=my_roodi_config.yml "rails_app/**/*.rb"`

If you're writing a check, it is useful to see the structure of a file the way that Roodi tokenizes it (via ruby_parser). Use:

`$ roodi-describe [filename]`

## Running it as part of your build

Add the following to your Rakefile:

    require 'roodi_task'
    task :default => [:roodi]

or if you want to supply your own config file...

    require 'roodi_task'
    RoodiTask.new :config => 'config/roodi.yml'
    task :default => [:roodi]

## Editor integration
You can run Roodi in Atom using the [linter-roodi](https://atom.io/packages/linter-roodi) package.

## Custom Configuration

To change the set of checks included, or to change the default values of the checks, you can provide your own config file.  The config file is a YAML file that lists the checks to be included.  Each check can optionally include a hash of options that are passed to the check to configure it.  For example, the default config file looks like this:

    AssignmentInConditionalCheck:
    CaseMissingElseCheck:
    ClassLineCountCheck:
      line_count: 300
    ClassNameCheck:
      pattern: !ruby/regexp /^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$/
    ClassVariableCheck:
    CyclomaticComplexityBlockCheck:
      complexity: 4
    CyclomaticComplexityMethodCheck:
      complexity: 8
    EmptyRescueBodyCheck:
    ForLoopCheck:
    MethodLineCountCheck:
      line_count: 20
    MethodNameCheck:
      pattern: !ruby/regexp /^[_a-z<>=\[|+-\/\*`]+[_a-z0-9_<>=~@\[\]]*[=!\?]?$/
    ModuleLineCountCheck:
      line_count: 300
    ModuleNameCheck:
      pattern: !ruby/regexp /^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$/
    ParameterNumberCheck:
      parameter_count: 5

## Supported Checks

* AssignmentInConditionalCheck - Check for an assignment inside a conditional.  It's probably a mistaken equality comparison.
* CaseMissingElseCheck - Check that case statements have an else statement so that all cases are covered.
* ClassLineCountCheck - Check that the number of lines in a class is below the threshold.
* ClassNameCheck - Check that class names match convention.
* CyclomaticComplexityBlockCheck - Check that the cyclomatic complexity of all blocks is below the threshold.
* CyclomaticComplexityMethodCheck - Check that the cyclomatic complexity of all methods is below the threshold.
* EmptyRescueBodyCheck - Check that there are no empty rescue blocks.
* ForLoopCheck - Check that for loops aren't used (Use Enumerable.each instead)
* MethodLineCountCheck - Check that the number of lines in a method is below the threshold.
* MethodNameCheck - Check that method names match convention.
* ModuleLineCountCheck - Check that the number of lines in a module is below the threshold.
* ModuleNameCheck - Check that module names match convention.
* ParameterNumberCheck - Check that the number of parameters on a method is below the threshold.

## Suggested Checks

* BlockVariableShadowCheck - Check that a block variable does not have the same name as a method parameter or local variable.  It may be mistakenly referenced within the block.
