This project allows you to calculate the direction between two locations and display the route on a Google Map using the Google Directions API - This project isn't actively been maintained.

Sample
------------

The sample makes use of the Google Places API for Android in order to provide a real life example of how the library can be used.[You can check it out on the store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.directions.sample)

Download
--------


Grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.jd-alexander</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
    compile 'com.github.jd-alexander:library:1.1.0'
```

Usage
-----

To calculate the route you simply instantiate a Routing object and trigger the execute function.


*You can execute the task in this manner. ( See the example for more details on the exact implementation)



``` java

        Routing routing = new Routing.Builder()
                    .travelMode(/* Travel Mode */)
                    .withListener(/* Listener that delivers routing results.*/)
                    .waypoints(/*waypoints*/)
                    .key(/*api key for quota management*/)
                    .build();
        routing.execute();
        
```



actual code 
``` java
        start = new LatLng(18.015365, -77.499382);
        waypoint= new LatLng(18.01455, -77.499333);
        end = new LatLng(18.012590, -77.500659);
        
        Routing routing = new Routing.Builder()
                    .travelMode(Routing.TravelMode.WALKING)
                    .withListener(this)
                    .waypoints(start, waypoint, end)
                    .build();
        routing.execute();
        
        .....
        
       @Override
    public void onRoutingSuccess(ArrayList<Route> route, int shortestRouteIndex)
    {
       //code to add route to map here. See sample app for more details.
    }
```

Demo App
------------
*  https://github.com/hamza-ameer/GoogleMaps-Find-Routes/tree/Updated


Known Issues
------------
*  If the AutoComplete TextView/Map of the sample app isnt working then probably the API key hasn't been set in the manifest.

* If the route is not being displayed then type "Routing" in your log cat to see the potential error messages from the library.
