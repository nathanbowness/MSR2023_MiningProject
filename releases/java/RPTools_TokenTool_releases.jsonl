Default overlays were not being copied into user directory. Fixed.\r\n* [#203][i203] - File -> Save As... file type selector would only allow `.webp`. Fixed.\r\n\r\n[i205]: https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/issues/205\r\n[i203]: https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/issues/203\r\n\r\n[TokenTool 2.2.1 Change Log](https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/blob/2.2.1/CHANGE_LOG.md)\r\n\r\n## Platform Notes\r\n\r\nDownload one of the assets listed below.  Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.\r\n- Windows:  Use either `.msi` (recommended) or `.exe`.\r\n  - If you have added custom overlays, they should still be accessible when installing this version over previous versions.\r\n  - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears.  This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.\r\n- Linux:  Use either `.deb` or `.rpm` (depending on which packager your system uses).\r\n  - The `deb` version installs under `/opt/tokentool/bin` as `TokenTool`.\r\n- macOS:  Use either `.pkg` (recommended) or `.dmg`.\r\n  - On macOS, to run the `.pkg` installer the first time after installation, or to run the application after dragging it from the `.dmg` image, hold **Ctrl** while clicking the icon and _continue to hold Ctrl_ while choosing **Open**.  You should then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).\r\n  - The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken.  See [this MapTool issue](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/issues/2679) for more details.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RPTools/TokenTool/releases/46670189/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 5, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

currently so if you did not have 2.1 installed previously your 2.2 installation will be missing the default overlays.  You can download the complete set as a zip file.  See assets below.  Filename is `TokenToolOverlays.zip`.  Simply unzip the contents into the `.tokentool-rptools\\overlays` folder which is located in your user home directory. \r\nUnder Windows it will be `c:\\users\\<username>\\.tokentool-rptools\\overlays`.\r\n\r\n- Updated to Java 16.\r\n- Improvements to PDF handling.\r\n- Choose from `webp`, `png`, `jpg`, `gif` and `tif` image formats for both the Token and Portrait saved images. Token and Portrait can have different save formats.\r\n\r\nSee [Change Log](https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/blob/2.2.0/CHANGE_LOG.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Platform Notes\r\n***We strongly encourage you to use the installer format for your operating system.*** The JAR file should only by used by advanced users comfortable with installing Java releases. It requires a working Java 16 install with JavaFX on your system in order to use it.\r\n\r\nDownload one of the assets listed below.  Each platform has options for which file to download, as described below.\r\n- Windows:  Use either `.msi` (recommended) or `.exe`.\r\n  - Recommend that previous versions be uninstalled prior to installing new one.\r\n  - Do not install over older versions of TokenTool\r\n  - We're seeing notes from Windows users that they double-click the icon after installing and no window appears.  This seems to be an antivirus issue, so check your AV if you have this problem.\r\n- Linux:  Use either `.deb` or `.rpm` (depending on which packager your system uses).\r\n  - The `deb` version installs under `/opt/maptool/bin` as `MapTool`.\r\n- macOS:  Use either `.pkg` (recommended) or `.dmg`.\r\n  - On macOS, to run the app the first time after installation, hold Ctrl while clicking the icon and _continue to hold Ctrl_ while choosing **Open**, then choose to open the application (this is part of Apple's approach when dealing with an unidentified developer).\r\n  - The macOS Gatekeeper may flag the DMG file as broken.  See [this issue](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/issues/2679) for more details.\r\n"}

using the same background image and/or colors!  Several bug fixes and requested enhancements have also been added.  Full ChangeLog shown below.\r\n\r\n**All versions, except for the `.jar` file, include the required Java runtime.  Installing other Java packages can cause issues.**\r\n\r\n## Note for Mac Users:\r\n\r\nTo execute the application after dragging it to your desktop, you will need to Ctrl-click (or right-click) the **.app** and hold down Ctrl when you click **Open** (this is only needed the first time, and only because Apple won't recognize the application as being from an \"identified developer\").\r\n\r\n## Note for Windows Users:\r\n\r\nSince RPTools is not a \"known software publisher\" by Microsoft, you will need to click through the prompts to execute this tool the first time.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:**  Kaspersky has recently started flagging the Windows executable as containing issues and will quarantine the file upon download.  All attempts to contact Kaspersky and correct this have failed.  You are welcome to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hbn2bfn) and discuss this with other Windows users in the `#tokentool` channel.  (And if you have a way to contact them, please ask them to recheck it.  Their web portal fails when we try to do that ourselves.)\r\n\r\n## Note for Users Downloading the JAR:\r\n\r\nThis version requires JavaFX which means you must have Java 9 or 10.  The current version of Java 11 from Oracle or the OpenJDK will **not** work because the JavaFX library isn't included.  If you have enough development background, you may be able to puzzle this out but we are only supporting Java 10 at this point.\r\n\r\n# ChangeLog\r\n\r\n* Open and extract images straight from the module! Using the File -> Open PDF menu or dragging a PDF to the main window, you can open and view and PDF. The individual images are shown to the right and you can either drag them to the main window or left-click with the mouse to use the image as the Portrait or right-click with the mouse to use the image as the background.\r\n* You can use the arrow keys as well as the number pad to nudge the images 1 pixel at a time! Be sure you have the layer selected that you want to move.\r\n* In addition to background color, you can now supply a background image! When dragging images to the main window, drop zones will highlight and the \"Layer\" button in the upper right will tell you if you are setting the Portrait or Background image. Several options have been added to support the use of backgrounds as well.\r\n* Several keyboard shortcuts as well as Accelerators have been added to the various menu items.\r\n* The screen capture window now remembers its size! In fact, all the windows now remember their size and position!\r\n* Didn't mean to capture that screen shot? Pressing ESC key will now cancel the action and close the window.\r\n* A new menu option under Help -> Reset Settings will restore all settings to their defaults.\r\n* A few new overlays were added, enjoy!\r\n* If you unlock the aspect ratio (pressing the padlock on the Overlay Options), you can now set the token size to any integer.\r\n* The overlay's original width x height is now displayed under the Overlays name on the Overlay Options panel\r\n* Save options were expanded to allow you to save the Portrait used (with or without Background color/image) alongside the token. This is useful if you grabbed the image from a URL or PDF and forgot or couldn't save it. If you save with Background Options, it will save the portrait as a .jpg instead of a .png (which are typically 10x smaller in disk space) so you can use that high quality PNG from the PDF to create a token but use a smaller jpg for the Portrait (say, in MapTool) where transparency is probably not needed or wanted.\r\n\r\nView the [CHANGE_LOG](https://github.com/RPTools/TokenTool/blob/cfeba7a1fa780b4111a2940c2e24ee4da3825c54/CHANGE_LOG.md) for more details."}
