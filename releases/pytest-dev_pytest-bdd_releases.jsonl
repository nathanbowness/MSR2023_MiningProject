They will be executed as normal fixtures: code after the yield is executed during teardown of the test. (youtux) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/503\r\n- Scenario outlines unused example parameter validation is removed (olegpidsadnyi) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/499\r\n- Add type annotations (youtux) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/505\r\n- ``pytest_bdd.parsers.StepParser`` now is an Abstract Base Class. Subclasses must make sure to implement the abstract methods. (youtux) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/505\r\n- Angular brackets in step definitions are only parsed in \"Scenario Outline\" (previously they were parsed also in normal \"Scenario\"s) (youtux) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/pull/524.\r\n"}

You won't need to define the steps twice like ``@given(\"there are <start> cucumbers\")`` and ``@given(parsers.parse(\"there are {start} cucumbers\"))``. The latter will be enough.\r\n- Removed ``example_converters`` from ``scenario(...)`` signature. You should now use just the ``converters`` parameter for ``given``, ``when``, ``then``.\r\n- Removed ``--cucumberjson-expanded`` and ``--cucumber-json-expanded`` options. Now the JSON report is always expanded.\r\n- Removed ``--gherkin-terminal-reporter-expanded`` option. Now the terminal report is always expanded.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/releases/51991363/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 7, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
