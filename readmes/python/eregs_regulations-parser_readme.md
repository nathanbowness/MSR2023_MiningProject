Regulations Parser
==================

This library/tool parses federal regulations (either plain text or XML) and
much of their associated content. It can write the results to JSON files, an
API, or even a git repository. The parser works hand-in-hand with
[regulations-core](https://github.com/eregs/regulations-core), an API for hosting the parsed regulations and
[regulations-site](https://github.com/eregs/regulations-site), a front-end for the data structures generated.

This repository is part of a larger project. To read about it, please see
