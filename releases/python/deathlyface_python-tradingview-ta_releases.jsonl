Now you can write simpler and shorter code with arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tradingview_ta import TA_Handler, Interval, Exchange\r\n\r\ntesla = TA_Handler(\r\n    symbol=\"TSLA\",\r\n    screener=\"america\",\r\n    exchange=\"NASDAQ\",\r\n    interval=Interval.INTERVAL_1_DAY\r\n)\r\nprint(tesla.get_analysis().summary)\r\n# Example output: {\"RECOMMENDATION\": \"BUY\", \"BUY\": 8, \"NEUTRAL\": 6, \"SELL\": 3}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't worry though, your older code (>=3.0.0) might still work with this version. Consider rewriting it if you have the time!"}
