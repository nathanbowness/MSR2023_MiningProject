Calimero-core provides (secure) KNX communication protocols, KNX datapoint & property access, and management functionality. [Java SE 11](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) (_java.base_) is the minimum required runtime environment.
Calimero was developed with a focus on applications that run on embedded devices and require a small footprint.

Code examples for using this library are shown in the [introduction](https://github.com/calimero-project/introduction).

Logging
-------

Calimero uses the [Simple Logging Facade for Java (slf4j)](http://www.slf4j.org/). Users can bind any desired logging frameworks. The default dependency is the [Simple Logger](http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html). The simple logger logs everything to standard output, and can be configured via the file `simplelogger.properties`, JVM system properties, or `java` command line options, e.g., `-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=trace`.

Testing
-------

For unit tests, Calimero provides a [test network](https://github.com/calimero-project/calimero-testnetwork) consisting of a [KNXnet/IP server](https://github.com/calimero-project/calimero-server) and a virtual KNX network with two [KNX devices](https://github.com/calimero-project/calimero-device). The complete test network is implemented in software, and can be executed in any J2SE runtime environment. The network provides the remote KNXnet/IP endpoint for executing unit tests for KNXnet/IP tunneling, busmonitoring, routing, device management, and KNX IP protocols. The same network setup is used for Calimero Travis CI.

Start the test network (`gradle run`) in the directory "_calimero-core/test/testnetwork-launcher_" before running any KNXnet/IP or KNX IP tests. When using Gradle, KNXnet/IP tests can be excluded via `useJUnitPlatform() { excludeTags 'knxnetip' }`.

Currently, the TP-UART and FT1.2 protocols can only be tested if the corresponding hardware is available.
