# protobuf-to-dict

protobuf-to-dict is a small Python library for creating dicts from protocol
buffers. It is intended to be used as an intermediate step before
serialization (e.g. to JSON).

## Installation

Use `pip install protobuf-to-dict` or `python setup.py install`.

## Example

Given the `google.protobuf.message.Message` subclass `MyMessage`:

```python
>>> from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict
>>> my_message = MyMessage()
>>> # pb_my_message is a protobuf string
>>> my_message.ParseFromString(pb_my_message)
>>> protobuf_to_dict(my_message)
{'message': 'Hello'}
```

## Caveats

This library grew out of the desire to serialize a protobuf-encoded message to
[JSON](http://json.org/). As JSON has no built-in binary type (all strings in
JSON are Unicode strings), any field whose type is
`FieldDescriptor.TYPE_BYTES` is, by default, converted to a base64-encoded
string.

If you want to override this behaviour, you may do so by passing
`protobuf_to_dict` a dictionary of protobuf types to callables via the
`type_callable_map` kwarg:

```python
>>> from copy import copy
>>> from google.protobuf.descriptor import FieldDescriptor
>>> from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, TYPE_CALLABLE_MAP
>>>
>>> type_callable_map = copy(TYPE_CALLABLE_MAP)
>>> # convert TYPE_BYTES to a Python bytestring
>>> type_callable_map[FieldDescriptor.TYPE_BYTES] = str
>>>
>>> # my_message is a google.protobuf.message.Message instance
>>> protobuf_to_dict(my_message, type_callable_map=type_callable_map)
```

By default, the integer representation is used for enum values. To use their
string labels instead, pass `use_enum_labels=True` into `protobuf_to_dict`:

```python
>>> protobuf_to_dict(my_message, use_enum_labels=True)
```

## Unit testing

Tests are under `src/tests/`.

```sh
$ python setup.py nosetests
```

To regenerate `src/tests/sample_pb2.py`:

```sh
$ protoc --python_out=src -Isrc src/tests/sample.proto 
```
