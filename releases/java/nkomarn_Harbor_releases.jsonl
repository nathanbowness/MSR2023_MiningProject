It's been a while since the last Harbor release. I have spent an absolute ton of time improving my Java development skills and a lot of that has transferred to this Harbor release! This is one of the largest updates feature-wise that Harbor has had to date.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: The old (1.6.1 and lower) configuration WILL NOT WORK with Harbor 1.6.2. This release of Harbor COMPLETELY revamps the configuration. Please delete your old configuration file before upgrading. Before asking for support, check to make sure you reset your configuration :>\r\n\r\n**Changelog:**\r\n\u2022 Rewrote a majority of the codebase to optimize for performance. Changes include minimizing static variable use throughout the codebase and using FastUtil type-specific HashMaps where possible for the best performance.\r\n\u2022 Made the world checker task asynchronous.\r\n\u2022 Refactored the configuration file, making options more clear and easily accessible.\r\n\u2022 Added bossbar messages that display when players are in bed with progress until night skip.\r\n\u2022 Re-implemented chat messages for bed entry/leave.\r\n\u2022 Added a chat message cooldown for bed entry/leave, configurable in the config.\r\n\u2022 Added a [displayname] placeholder to chat messages.\r\n\u2022 Added an option to exclude vanished players from Harbor's counts.\r\n\u2022 Players with isSleepingIgnored are now ignored from Harbor's counts.\r\n\u2022 Added /forceskip to allow players to forcibly skip the night in their world if they have the \"harbor.forceskip\" permission node.\r\n\u2022 Added an instant night skip toggle, which allows the skip animation to be bypassed (mimics Harbor 1.5 and lower behavior).\r\n\u2022 Added proportional acceleration as a configuration option. Enabling this speeds up the night skip rate based on the amount of players sleeping out of the online player count (https://github.com/nkomarn/Harbor/issues/47).\r\n\u2022 Re-implemented lightweight fallback AFK kick system in case your server doesn't use Essentials.\r\n\u2022 Fixed night skip loops being triggered when weather and thunder clearing was disabled but night was skipped during a thunderstorm.\r\n\u2022 Added a world blacklist and whitelist.\r\n\u2022 Made weather and thunder toggles independent.\r\n\u2022 The time in ticks that Harbor considers as day time is now configurable.\r\n\u2022 Added a configurable night skip time tick change rate.\r\n\u2022 Added a warning system in case Harbor 1.6.2 is ran with the 1.6.1 configuration.\r\n\u2022 Removed auto updater.
