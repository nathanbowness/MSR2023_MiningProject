SAI (Split APKs Installer) is an Android app that lets you install split APKs (such as ones distributed as Android App Bundle). It has both rooted and rootless installation methods.

## State of SAI
SAI is kinda dead cause I have no motivation for continuing its development. I will probably maybe still occasionally fix bugs and add small features/improvements, focusing on the installer functionality, but idk.
