# Linux ACPI (Platform) Drivers for 5th Gen. Surface Devices

Linux embedded controller driver for 5th generation (and later) Surface devices required for battery status and more.

_Note: These modules are integrated into https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface._
_There is no need to install it separately if you've already installed one of the kernels provided there._
If you have a Surface Book 2 you might also want to have a look at the [dtx-daemon][dtx-daemon] and the [surface-control][surface-control] utility.

If you want to help out, have a look at the corresponding issues.
In most cases, we just need a bit of information from someone who owns such a device.
Also, if you think there's anything missing here, feel free to open an issue!
