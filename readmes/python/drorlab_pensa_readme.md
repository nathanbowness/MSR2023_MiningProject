A collection of Python methods for exploratory analysis and comparison of protein structural ensembles, e.g., from molecular dynamics simulations.
All functionality is available as a Python package.  

To get started, see the [__documentation__](https://pensa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which includes a tutorial for the PENSA library.

If you would like to contribute, check out our [__contribution guidelines__](https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [__to-do list__](https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/blob/master/TODO.md).

## Functionality

With PENSA, you can (currently):
- __compare structural ensembles__ of proteins via the relative entropy of their features, statistical tests, or state-specific information and visualize deviations on a reference structure.
- project several ensembles on a __joint reduced representation__ using principal component analysis (PCA) or time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and sort the structures along the obtained components.
- __cluster structures across ensembles__ via k-means or regular-space clustering and write out the resulting clusters as trajectories.
- trace allosteric information flow through a protein using __state-specific information__ analysis methods.

Proteins are featurized via [PyEMMA](http://emma-project.org/latest/) using backbone torsions, sidechain torsions, or backbone C-alpha distances, making PENSA compatible to all functionality available in PyEMMA. In addition, we provide density-based methods to featurize water and ion pockets.

Trajectories are processed and written using [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/). Plots are generated using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Documentation
PENSA's documentation pages are [here](https://pensa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where you find installation instructions, API documentation, and a tutorial.

#### Example Scripts
For the most common applications, example [Python scripts](https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/tree/master/scripts) are provided. We show how to run the example scripts in a short separate [tutorial](https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/tree/master/tutorial).

#### Demo on Google Colab
We demonstrate how to use the PENSA library in an interactive and animated example on Google Colab, where we use freely available simulations of a mu-Opioid Receptor from GPCRmd.
