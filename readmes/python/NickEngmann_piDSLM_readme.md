# Introduction

Made an enclosure to host the [HQ Raspberry Pi Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) as a standalone battery-powered DSLM that I'm calling piDSLM. Check out the links below for instructions on how to recreate the project!

The design includes a few modular camera grips for users. Feel free to make your own designs and reach out to me so I can include them!

# Installation

For the codebase, I built the piDSLM codebase off of a forked a copy of fellow DIYer Martin Manders [MerlinPi project](https://github.com/MisterEmm/MerlinPi). The piDSLM codebase is still in its infancy but it allows the user to take photos/videos, and view them in a gallery. It also allows users to bulk upload the footage to Dropbox. To begin ssh into the Raspberry Pi and run the following command:

```

git clone https://github.com/NickEngmann/pidslm.git
cd pidslm
```

You're then going to retrieve a Dropbox Access token to enable to Dropbox footage upload feature. To do this go ahead and [go to the Application Developer page on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps). Create an application and click the Generate Access Token button to generate your access token.

Then replace the dummy access token in Dropbox_upload.py with your new access token.

```

# OAuth2 access token.  TODO: login etc.
TOKEN = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

Finally, run the INSTALL.sh script using the following command

```
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
```
