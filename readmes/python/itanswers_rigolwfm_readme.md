Using `.wfm` files created by Rigol scopes
========================================================================

This project is intended to be a comprehensive resource for interpreting waveform ``.wmf`` files created by any Rigol oscilloscope.  Open source (and Rigol's own applications) that parse/convert Rigol's binary ``.wfm`` files are sadly balkanized: each program tends to support a single oscilloscope group and the available efforts are spread across a range of languages.

This project leverages a domain specific language (kaitai struct) to represent the binary files.  Once a binary file has been described in this text format, parsers can be generated for a wide range of languages (C++/STL, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby).  

Kaitai Struct <https://kaitai.io> also has a slick web IDE <https://ide.kaitai.io> that allows one to interactively reverse engineer binary file formats directly in your browser.  This is super helpful for those Rigol ``.wfm`` formats that are undocumented.

Installation
------------

The RigolWFM package can be installed via `pip`::

   pip install RigolWFM

Usage
-----

Once this is done, one can plot the signals from binary Rigol ``.wfm`` files by::

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import RigolWFM.wfm as rigol

   filename = 'example.wfm'
   scope = 'DS1000E'

   w = rigol.Wfm.from_file(filename, scope)
   w.plot()
   plt.show()


Alternatively, ``wfmconvert`` can be used from the command line.  For example, the following should convert all the DS1000E files in the current directory to the ``.csv`` format::

   prompt> wfmconvert E csv *.wfm

If you wanted to create `.wav` files for use with LTSpice then this would create them:: 

   prompt> wfmconvert E wav *.wfm

More extensive documentation can be found at <https://RigolWFM.readthedocs.io>

Status
------

There is a bit of work remaining (testing, validation, repackaging) but there are binary file descriptions for ``.wfm`` files created by the following scopes:

* DS1000C untested
* DS1000E tested
* DS1000Z tested, but with wonky voltage offsets
* DS2000 tested
* DS4000 tested
* DS6000 untested

Resources
---------

This has been a bit of an adventure.  In the process of nailing down the basic formats, I have gleaned information from a wide range of projects started by others.
