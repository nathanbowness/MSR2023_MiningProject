Originally modules was introduced when `github.com/pin/tftp` package was already tagged with major version v2. So v2 became incompatible and recommended way to move forward is to cut the new major version just for the sake of module compatibility.\r\n\r\nBranch `master` will be used to develop v3 for now.\r\nBranch `v2` is to keep the head of major version v2.\r\n\r\nNote, API-wise v2 and v3 are identical. Also I believe there is no users of v1 in the wild because it had pretty short lifespan long time ago.\r\n\r\nSo it must be absolutely safe for anyone to move to v3 anytime. I don't think we will see any new v2 subversion therefore."}

See `SetBackoff` method. Implemented by @acd\n- `RemoteAddr` method allows retrieving remote peer's IP address and port. It can be particularly useful for logging from inside request handlers. Implemented by @acd \n\nProtocol implementation improvements by @acd:\n- Remote port / TID check during transmission.\n- Remote IP address check (necessary due to the use of unconnected UDP sockets).\n\nFixes:\n- Close UDP connection at the end of a transfer. No connections piling up on OS X anymore, no need to bump `ulimit` to allow more open file descriptors.\n- Correct server IP in unit-tests allows reliable unit-tests execution on OS X. It was discovered during remote IP check testing and was fixed by @acd. No test flaps on OS X anymore.\n"}
