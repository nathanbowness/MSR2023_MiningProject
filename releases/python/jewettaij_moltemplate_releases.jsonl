This is an attempt to address issue #46.\r\n\r\nI *think* this is working now.  However, if you use hydrogen bonds with DREIDING, then please double-check the \"system.in.settings\" files created by moltemplate.sh, and check each \"pair_coeff\" command containing the text \"hbond/dreiding/lj\".  Make sure that the atom types are listed in the correct order, with donor atom types listed before acceptor atoms.  Before doing this, I suggest running [cleanup_moltemplate.sh](https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/blob/master/doc/doc_cleanup_moltemplate.md#cleanup_moltemplatesh) first.  *(Otherwise the number of pair_coeff commands in the \"system.in.settings\" file might be too large to check by hand.  The \"cleanup_moltemplate.sh\" program should work without issue with DREIDING simulation files as long as your main LT file is named \"system.lt\".  Just type \"cleanup_moltemplate.sh\" into the terminal after running moltemplate.sh.  In the future, when \"dreiding.lt\" is debugged, this extra effort won't be necessary.)*\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Aileen Huang (ahuang5@student.gn.k12.ny.us) for reporting this issue!\r\n"}

When preparing an all-atom simulation using moltemplate, the most difficult task is to determine the correct type for each atom.  (Some tools make this easier, but this issue can arise with these tools as well.)  DREIDING has the advantage that it is comparatively easy to choose appropriate atom types for a wide variety of molecules.  Matthew provided a short guide, currently available [here](https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/blob/master/doc/DREIDING_Label_Manual.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/m-bone/moltemplate-DREIDING/blob/master/DREIDING_Label_Manual.pdf).\r\n(This guide might be moved in the future, but it will remain available.)\r\n\r\n### Limitations: *atomic charges*\r\nSome force-fields (like COMPASS, and moltemplate's version of OPLSAA) include rules for assigning partial charges to atoms.  Most force fields, including DREIDING do not.  So DREIDING users will have to obtain atomic charges by some other means, probably by using 3rd-party tools.  (Alternatively, LAMMPS' [fix qeq/point](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_qeq.html) feature can be used to assign partial charges, especially for simple molecules containing only C, H, O, N atoms.  If this fix is run infrequently, or run only once at the beginning of the simulation, then it should not slow the simulation down significantly.)\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nExamples using the DREIDING force field will be made available [here](https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/tree/master/examples/all_atom/force_field_DREIDING).\r\n(Currently there is only one example.)\r\n\r\n### Development Status: *beta*\r\nAs of 2020-10-19, this software has been tested for consistency between LAMMPS\r\nand Materials Studio using only two simple molecules (butane and ethylene).\r\nPlease use this force field with caution and report any inconsistencies you find."}

All rules for generating angles, dihedrals, impropers, and looking up bond types and charge-by-bonds, as well as all pair_coeff, bond_coeff, angle_coeff, dihedral_coeff, and improper_coeffs can accept wildcards and regular expressions (eg \"@atom:re.c[1-6]\") .  (NOTE: Regular expressions have not been tested yet, but the infrastructure for supporting them is finally there.)\r\n2) Counter variables ($ and @) can no longer contain , or () characters.  (In the future, this will make it much easier to create source code for programming languages.  Note to self: The +-=/. characters are still allowed.  The / and . characters are used for path resolution and should never be forbidden.)\r\n\r\nCOMPASS: The \"msifrc2lt.py\" script has been (hopefully) fixed and is now able to convert the COMPASS force field files again.  This made it possible to fix 2 bugs in the \"compass_published.lt\" force field file: 1) wildcards are now given low priority instead of high priority, and 2) non-hybrid bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and pair styles are used by default (for KOKKOS compatibility).  Also: Commas were removed from the atom type names (and replaced with ~ characters).\r\n"}

Hopefully this should make it easier to create LT files using namespaces and (nested) class definitions which behave in a way which is more similar to languages like python.\r\n\r\n(This may eventually ease the transition to creating a version of moltemplate where static node definitions are implemented as python class definitions.  It would be nice to have a version of moltemplate which can be run from within python itself.)\r\n"}
