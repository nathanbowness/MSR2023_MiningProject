See #88.\r\n- `examples/` is no longer included in the distribution (i.e. source distribution or binary wheels found on PyPI.) This should be a backward compatible change as `examples/` is never exposed as a Python module, nor entry points.\r\n- Added a couple of examples.\r\n- See more in <https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/compare/1.4.3...1.5.0>."}
