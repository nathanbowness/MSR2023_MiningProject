NVM4W attempts to run commands without elevation. If this succeeds (i.e. developer mode is enabled and active), the process continues without prompts. If a command fails, an attempt to run it with elevated privileges will trigger the UAC prompt.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Update error message when missing version argument. Fixes #722. by @0liver in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/731\r\n* Fix README.md incorrect element close by @WORMSS in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/768\r\n* Allow `nvm use` to be called with the part of the semver by @vladonemo in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/709\r\n* Refactor/minor typo fixed in comments by @SayefReyadh in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/806\r\n* Fix missing DisplayVersion registry key for nvm.iss by @awdr74100 in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/796\r\n* Update inno setup config to correctly report version (fix #851) by @psnitil in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/868\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @0liver made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/731\r\n* @WORMSS made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/768\r\n* @vladonemo made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/709\r\n* @SayefReyadh made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/806\r\n* @awdr74100 made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/796\r\n* @psnitil made their first contribution in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/868\r\n\r\nA few PR's were manually added, since merging them proved to be difficult after other changes. So, I'd like to give a special thanks to the following folks whose PR's were manually included (but not recognized in the changelog):\r\n* @thengoster for https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/784\r\n* @craig-et for https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/828 (which brought UAC prompts back)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/compare/1.1.9...1.1.10", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions/873", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/81609336/reactions", "total_count": 112, "+1": 67, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 20, "confused": 0, "heart": 11, "rocket": 8, "eyes": 6}, "mentions_count": 8}

"https://api.github.com/repos/coreybutler/nvm-windows/zipball/1.1.8", "body": "# NVM for Windows v1.1.8 Notes\r\n\r\nTruth be told, I did not want to release this version right now. I am working on the successor project [rt](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions/565), which was supposed to be the last version before the rt release. However, notable changes in the Node ecosystem warrant a new version now.\r\n\r\n**Node Corepack**\r\n\r\nIn September 2021, Node.js v16.9.0 introduced [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). This experimental new feature allows transparent use of npm, pnpm, or yarn. To support this feature, NVM4W must download and process a different distribution file than it has used previously.\r\n\r\nAs a result, NVM for Windows 1.1.8 is being released to support corepack.\r\n\r\n## How to Upgrade\r\n\r\nAll files can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.8).\r\n\r\n**If you do not have NVM for Windows installed**\r\nUse the instructions in the README.\r\n\r\n**If you already have an older version of NVM for Windows installed**\r\nDownload *nvm-update.zip* and extract it. You will find a file called *nvm-update.exe*. Double click to run it. This will prompt for the version you wish to upgrade to (pre-populated w/ 1.1.8).\r\n\r\nnvm-update.exe can also be run from the command line using the `/S` flag to suppress the prompt. To do this, run `nvm-update.exe 1.1.8 /S`.\r\n\r\n## What's New\r\n\r\nSeveral long-requested features/fixes have been merged since v1.1.7. I did not get to test all of them as extensively as I wanted to, but I believe they are stable. These features include:\r\n\r\n1. corepack support (see above)\r\n2. Support for spaces in filepaths [#355](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/355) (@s-h-a-d-o-w).\r\n3. `nvm install latest` - installs the latest patch version of Node (instead of latest minor).\r\n4. `nvm install lts` - installs the latest LTS patch version (new). (@tats-u)\r\n5. `nvm use latest`, `nvm use lts` (@tats-u), and `nvm use newest` (new) (@EEJesse) now supported.\r\n6. Elevated permissions applied only when necessary [#511](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/511) (@rbuckton).\r\n7. `nvm current` (new) displays the active version. (@riazXrazor)\r\n\r\nNumerous edge case fixes have been applied as well.\r\n1. Read environment variables in settings.txt (@mscott3)\r\n2. Compilation fixes (@taaem)\r\n3. Fix major version check (@rcknight)\r\n4. Parameterized settings.txt loader (@Himself65)\r\n\r\nA number of documentation updates have also been merged.\r\n\r\n## What didn't make it in?\r\n\r\n1. Aliases - these were originally scheduled for 1.1.8, but I never got to work on them.\r\n\r\n## WARNING\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.8 is **not code signed**. Code-signed applications are trusted by Windows and will install easily. Users are prompted with a screen like this one:\r\n\r\n![code signed](https://www.globalsign.com/application/files/9415/8088/1150/ms-authenticode-warning2.png)\r\n\r\nNon-code-signed applications can _usually_ be installed, but they will throw a warning like this:\r\n\r\n![non-code signing](https://sectigostore.com/static/images/code-sign-warning.png)\r\n\r\n**Why?**\r\n\r\nI paid for the last code signing certificates out of pocket, but they've expired. Sponsorships, to date, haven't even come close to covering the cost of a new code signing certificate (let alone the last one).\r\n\r\n**Who will this affect?**\r\n\r\nThis won't affect most users, but enterprise users and those distributing NVM4W in corporate environments may run into problems.\r\n\r\n**If your organization is impacted by this, I will accept sponsorship money to expedite the delivery of a code-signed version.** The required EV certificate is about $1000. Please direct message me on Twitter [@goldglovecb](https://twitter.com/goldglovecb) if you'd like to help cover this cost.\r\n", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions/664", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/49608681/reactions", "total_count": 245, "+1": 177, "-1": 0, "laugh": 22, "hooray": 6, "confused": 0, "heart": 33, "rocket": 6, "eyes": 1}, "mentions_count": 9}
