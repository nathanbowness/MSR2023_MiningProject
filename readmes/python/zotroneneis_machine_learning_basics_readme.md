# Machine learning basics

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.

## Data preprocessing

After several requests I started preparing notebooks on how to preprocess datasets for machine learning. Within the next months I will add one notebook for each kind of dataset (text, images, ...). As before, the intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the preprocessing steps, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations. 

- [Image preprocessing](image_preprocessing.ipynb)
- [Preprocessing a numerical/categorical dataset](data_preprocessing.ipynb)

## Live demo
Run the notebooks online without having to clone the repository or install jupyter: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics/HEAD).   
   
Note: this does not work for the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` and `image_preprocessing.ipynb` notebooks because they require downloading a dataset first.

## Feedback

If you have a favorite algorithm that should be included or spot a mistake in one of the notebooks, please let me know by creating a new issue.
