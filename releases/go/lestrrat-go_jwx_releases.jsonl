This is\r\n  hopefully the last releases that change backwards compatibility\r\n  in a major way, at least for some time to come.\r\n\r\n  It is unfortunate that we need to introduce API changes, but we\r\n  keep learning how the library is being used and the pain points\r\n  of using this library. Most of the times these pain points are\r\n  things that we initially did not think about, which in turn\r\n  requires us to rethink of the API.\r\n\r\n  If you do not wish to spend the time fixing your usage, make sure\r\n  you have your go.mod set up to not automatically track the latest\r\n  changes.\r\n\r\n  However, if you do decide to use the latest version, we believe\r\n  the API is more uniform across packages, and generally is easier\r\n  to understand. We hope this library helps some of you out there.\r\n\r\n[BREAKING CHANGES]\r\n  * `jwk.Parse(io.Reader)`, `jws.Parse(io.Reader)`, `jwt.Parse(io.Reader)`,\r\n    have all been changed to `Parse([]byte)`. To use an `io.Reader`,\r\n    use `ParseReader(io.Reader)`. `jwe.Parse` already took `[]byte`, so\r\n    has not been changed.\r\n\r\n    With this change, all four package `jwe`, `jwk`, `jws`, and `jwt` follow\r\n    the same API design, which should make things easier to navigate:\r\n\r\n      Parse([]byte)\r\n      ParseString(string)\r\n      ParseReader(io.Reader)\r\n\r\n  * `jwk.Set` is now an interface, not a struct. `jwk.Set` now has a\r\n    well-defined API to access and modify the `jwk.Key` objects that it holds.\r\n\r\n      Add(jwk.Key) bool\r\n      Clear()\r\n      Get(int) (jwk.Key, bool)\r\n      Index(jwk.Key) int\r\n      Len() int\r\n      LookupKeyID() (jwk.Key, bool) // Read the section about it below\r\n      Remove(jwk.Key) bool\r\n      Iterate(context.Context) KeyIterator\r\n\r\n  * `(jwk.Set).LookupKeyID()` no longer returns an array of `jwk.Key`.\r\n    Instead, only the first key matching the given key ID will be returned.\r\n    If you need to work with multiple keys, use `(jwk.Set).Iterate()` or\r\n    `(jwk.Set).Get()` to look for matching keys.\r\n\r\n  * `jwk.PublicKeyOf()` has been renamed to `jwk.PublicRawKeyOf()`,\r\n    which converts raw keys (e.g. `rsa.PrivateKey`) to their public\r\n    counter part (e.g. `rsa.PublicKey`)\r\n\r\n    `jwk.PublicKeyOf()` is now used to get the public counter part of\r\n    `jwk.Key` objects (e.g. `jwk.RSAPrivateKey` to `jwk.RSAPublicKey`)\r\n\r\n    `jwk.PublicSetOf()` has been added to get a new `jwk.Set` but with\r\n    all keys transformed to public keys via `jwk.PublicKeyOf()`\r\n\r\n  * `jwk.FetchXXXX` functions have been removed. `jwk.Fetch()` remains, but\r\n    it now takes `context.Context`, and doesn't support retrieving files\r\n    from the local file system. See `ReadFile()` for that.\r\n\r\n  * `jws.VerifyWithJKU()`, `jws.VerifyWithJWK()`, `jwk.VerifyWithJWKSet()`\r\n    have all been removed, but `jwk.VerifySet(jwk.Set)` has been added.\r\n\r\n  * `jws.SplitCompact(io.Reader)` has been changd to `jws.SplitCompact([]byte)`\r\n    Similar to `Parse()`, `SplitCompactReader(io.Reader)` and `SplitCompactString(string)`\r\n    have been added\r\n\r\n  * `jws.SignLiteral` has been removed.\r\n\r\n  * `jws.PayloadSigner` has been removed (but should not matter, because\r\n    this as internal-use only anyways)\r\n\r\n  * `jwe.WithPrettyJSONFormat` has been renamed to `jwe.WithPrettyFormat`\r\n\r\n  * `jwt.Verify` has been removed. Use `jwt.Parse()` aloing with the `jwt.WithVerify()`\r\n    option to perform signature verification. Validation of verified data\r\n    can be performed via `(jwt.Token).Validate()` method, which has been available\r\n    since v1.0.6\r\n\r\n  * Package `buffer` has been removed. This package should have been an internal\r\n    package to start with, but it was left because it had been incorporated\r\n    in the public API in our initial versions.\r\n\r\n  * `(jwk.Key).Get(jwk.X509CertChainKey)` no longer returns a `jwk.CertificateChain`.\r\n    Instead it returns a raw []*x509.Certificate.\r\n\r\n  * `(jwt.Token).Size() has been removed.\r\n\r\n  * `jwt.WithOpenIDClaims()` has been removed. Use `jwt.WithToken(openid.New())` instead.\r\n\r\n[New Features]\r\n  * `jwe.ReadFile(string)`, `jwk.ReadFile(string)`, `jws.ReadFile(string)`, and\r\n    `jwt.ReadFile(string)` have been added. In the future, we plan to introduce\r\n    a `WithFS` option so you can read from an arbitrary file system, but this cannot\r\n    be added while we keep go < 1.16 compatibility. If you want something like that,\r\n    you will need to put an adapter over the jwx for the time being.\r\n\r\n  * `(jwk.Key).PublicKey()` has been added. This method creates a corresponding\r\n    public key, with all fields (except those that shouldn't be) copied over.\r\n    This allows you to easily create a public key of a private key with the\r\n    same \"kid\" attribute.\r\n    \r\n  * Both `jws.Verify` and `jws.Sign` methods can now handle `jwk.Key` objects, on\r\n    top of raw keys (e.g. rsa.PrivateKey). You no longer need to conver the\r\n    `jwk.Key` objects that you have in to raw keys before using these functions.\r\n    \r\n  * `(jws.Header).Remove(string)`, `(jwk.Key).Remove(string)`, and\r\n    `(jwt.Token).Remove(string)` have been added. `jwe.Header` already had a `Remove()`\r\n    method, so it has not been changed. \r\n    \r\n  * `(jwk.Key).Clone() has been added.\r\n  \r\n[Miscellaneous]\r\n  * Default branch for the repository is now `main`.\r\n  \r\n  * Options have been reworked. In most instances, option types should now reflect\r\n    better the contexts in which they can be used. For example, `jwk` now has\r\n    `AutoRefreshOption` and `FetchOption` instead of a single `Option`.\r\n  \r\n  * JSON marshaling should be 10~30% faster by default (though they may take\r\n    more allocations to achieve this).\r\n    \r\n    However, if performance is really bogging you down, you can try to enable\r\n    the optional module github.com/goccy/go-json by enabling the \"jwx_goccy\" tag\r\n\r\n      go build -tags jwx_goccy ... \r\n    \r\n    In some cases you get an extra 40~50% performance improvement in serailization\r\n    https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/pull/314#issue-560594020\r\n    https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/pull/314#issuecomment-766343888\r\n  \r\n  * Location for examples and benchmarks have changed: Now examples/ and bench/\r\n    are their respective locations, and they are each a standalone module,\r\n    so that in case we need extra imports (such as the case in examples)\r\n    they do not interfere with users who just want to include jwx in their projects.\r\n```"}

Please beware that the API has significantly changed, and **breaks backwards compatibility**. If you were previously using this library, then you WILL have to change how you use it.\r\n\r\nThanks to the many contributors who pointed out mistakes, and nudged me to take a hard look at the code to improve it in ways that I previously didn't immediately see.\r\n\r\n```\r\nv1.0.0 - 03 May 2020\r\n  * All packages (`jws`, `jwe`, `jwk`, `jwt`) have all been reworked from\r\n    the ground-up.\r\n    * These packages now hide the actual implementation of the main structs behind an interface.\r\n    * Header/Token structs must now be instantiated using proper constructors\r\n      (most notably, json.Unmarshal will miserably fail if you just pass\r\n       and empty interface via `xxx.Token` or similar)\r\n    * Token/Header interfaces are now more or less standardized.\r\n      The following API should be consistent between all relevant packages:\r\n      * New()\r\n      * Get()\r\n      * Set()\r\n      * Remove()\r\n      * Iterate()\r\n      * Walk()\r\n      * AsMap()\r\n    * Oft-used fields are no longer directly accessible:\r\n      e.g. `token.KeyID = v` is no longer valid. You must set using `Set`\r\n      (and `Remove`, if you are removing it), and use either `Get` or\r\n      one of the utility methods such as `token.KeyID()`\r\n    * Many helper functions and structs have been unexported. They were never\r\n      meant to be anything useful for end-users, and hopefully it does not\r\n      cause any problems.\r\n    * Most errors type/instances have been removed from the public API\r\n  * `jwt` package can now work with different token types, such as OpenID tokens.\r\n    * `token.Sign` and `token.Verify` have been changed from methods to\r\n      package functions `jwt.Sign` and `jwt.Verify`, to allow different\r\n      types of tokens to be passed to the same logic.\r\n    * Added a custom token type in `openid` sub-package to make it easier to\r\n      work with OpenID claims\r\n    * `jwt.Parse` (and its siblings) now accept `jwt.WithOpenIDClaims()`\r\n  * `jwe` API has been reworked:\r\n    * `MultiEncrypt` has been removed.\r\n    * Serializer structs have been removed. Now you just need to call\r\n      `jwe.Compact` or `jwe.JSON`\r\n  * `jwk` API has been reworked:\r\n    * `jwk.ParseKey` has been added\r\n    * `jwk.Materialize` has been renamed to `Raw()`. A new corresponding\r\n      method to initialize the key from a raw key (RSA/ECDSA/byte keys)\r\n      called `FromRaw()` has also been added, which makes a nice pair.\r\n  * `jws` API has been reworked\r\n  * CI has been changed from Travis CI to Github Actions, and tests now\r\n    include linting via `golangci-lint`\r\n```"}
