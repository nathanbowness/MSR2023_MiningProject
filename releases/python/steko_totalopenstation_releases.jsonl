This release marks a renewed development process and the full onboarding of @psolyca in the team. With the 0.6 release we are planning to move the repository from the personal \"steko\" account to an organization account and improve the contribution guidelines so that the future of Total Open Station is not dependent on a single person. Of course we have already great plans for new features, as always listed on our issue tracker.\r\n\r\nIf you use Total Open Station please let us know and maybe give us a star \u2605 on GitHub.\r\n"}

This allows going beyond single points to managing lines and polygons, even though no such feature is available at the moment. If you often record linear or polygonal features that you\u2019re manually joining in the post-processing stage, think about helping TOPS development and you could get DXF or Shapefiles with the geometries ready to use (yes, Shapefile output is on our plans, too).\r\n\r\n**This version is the last built on Python 2, and work is already ongoing towards a new version that will be based on Python 3: a more mature codebase will mean a better program, without any visible drastic change.**"}
