Please, follow the Wiki page [Migrations](../wiki/Migrations).\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n- Resolved #34 - New Customizable FastScroller is now available, thanks to [arpinca](https://github.com/arpinca).\r\n- Resolved #217 - Extension for data binding.\r\n- Resolved #259 - Endless scrolling in both directions. If activated, items can only be inserted at the top of the list, top endless is complementary to the bottom endless.\r\n- Resolved #302 - Allow to use _custom_ LayoutManagers on the RecyclerView.\r\n- Resolved #382 - New advanced `FlexibleItemDecoration`.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations / New Behaviors\r\n- Update to support library 25.4.0. Read instructions on https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html.\r\n- Adapter now makes a copy of the provided list at _startup_, _updateDataSet_ and _filterItems_, before applying features (from support #316), as consequence you should remove the copy of the list in these 3 situations.\r\n- `onPostUpdate()` and `onPostFilter()` now require to call `super()` otherwise the emptyView won't get notified!\r\n- Starting or resetting the Filter will empty the bin of the deletedItems (see #341 and  #342).\r\n- Get rid of Method B to create and bind ViewHolders. From now on, we will use only _Method A_: we will delegate the previous operations to the item interfaces. Item interfaces will now mandatory implement the following methods: `getLayoutRes()`,  `createViewHolder()` and `bindViewHolder()` (see #344).\r\n- Making use of interface `Mode` to change selection mode (constants `MODE_*` are now deprecated).\r\n- Renamed `DividerItemDecoration` to `FlexibleItemDecoration`.\r\n- Renamed `Utils` to `FlexibleUtils`.\r\n- Resolved #377 - Item content not updating when animating `updateDataSet` (changing default behavior of `notifyChangeOfUnfilteredItems` to `true`).\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n- Resolved #269 - Setting to load more at startup when adapter list is initially empty/null.\r\n- Resolved #281 - Delegate spanSize to IFlexible item.\r\n- Resolved #288 - UndoHelper.remove(...) return type reverted to Snackbar.\r\n- Resolved #293 - `getItemViewType` now returns zero when item not found.\r\n- Optimized `updateDataSet()` and `filterItems()`: now hidden items are restored before applying the feature, so they won't get notified for removing and adding same items, but only for updating. This will improve performance avoiding useless notifications.\r\n- Resolved #293 - `getItemViewType` now returns zero when item not found.\r\n- Resolved #321 - Now items have option to be or not to be notified for a change if unfiltered `IFlexible.shouldNotifyChange()`.\r\n- Resolved #333 - StateListDrawable with `state_pressed` for API < 21.\r\n- Resolved #339 - Sticky headers in filtered list.\r\n- Resolved #343 - Allow to unbind ViewHolder `IFlexible.unbindViewHolder()`.\r\n- Resolved #348 - Customizable minimum scroll amount to show the FastScroller.\r\n- Resolved #348 - FastScroller can now be enabled/disabled at runtime again with a better toggle to enable/disable FastScroller.\r\n- Resolved #357 - Allow usage of `Parcelable` for IHeaders and IFlexible.\r\n- Resolved #362 - Improved filter engine: Filter items with optional originalList (works also with multi level).\r\n- Resolved #363 - Simplified the method `createViewHolder()` in IFlexible.\r\n- Resolved #376 - Sticky header preserves current offset from ItemDecorations.\r\n- Resolved #379 - Preventing possible NullPointerException.\r\n- Resolved #381 - Provided a better internal log system which does not allocate objects.\r\n- Created new method `setFullSpan()` in `FlexibleViewHolder`.\r\n- Created new method `getCurrentItems()`, returns the current internal list unmodifiable.\r\n- Created new method `isFiltering()`, returns `true` if the AsyncTask is currently running.\r\n- Created new method `updateItem()` overload method.\r\n- Added generic type param when returning FlexibleAdapter object.\r\n- Increased `ANIMATE_TO_LIMIT` to `1000` items.\r\n- Support libs to 25.3.1 (from question #331).\r\n- Project is now built with `provided` scope for RecyclerView Support lib.\r\n- New build scripts to support extensions modules.\r\n- New comprehensive Wiki pages!\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Fixed #268 - Sticky headers don't work when all headers are initially collapsed.\r\n- Fixed #284 - `removeAllScrollableFooters()` seems to notify incorrect item range.\r\n- Fixed #291 - progressItem not hidden automatically if delay is zero and no items loaded or Endless is disabled.\r\n- Fixed #292 - `HandlerCallback` mistakenly erases default Runnables posted on it's `mHandler`.\r\n- Fixed #294 - Expandable header is not resized / redrawn on automatic configuration change when sticky headers are enabled.\r\n- Fixed #295 - Items not notified on auto collapse (using normal List instead of Hash to avoid Inconsistency detection. It will be slower on big List when collapsing).\r\n- Fixed #296 - `autoCollapseOnExpand(true)` seems not notify the header.\r\n- Fixed #297 - Empty (Invisible) Header Item when Using Sticky Headers.\r\n- Fixed #299 - ClassCastException after click on expanded sticky header when AutoCollapse is enabled.\r\n- Fixed #320 - point 1) Sometimes the sticky header view losses it's background.\r\n- Fixed #320 - point 2) Sometimes the sticky header is not shown correctly when is being collapsed.\r\n- Fixed #322 - Loop in `getSectionItemPositions()`.\r\n- Fixed #328 - Filtering issue during delete search query (make sure index is in bounds).\r\n- Fixed #347 - Sticky Header doesn't update selected view state correct for Single & Multi selection.\r\n- Fixed #352 - Multilevel expandable list - Sub-Sub-Items are now filtered\r\n- Fixed #350 - LayoutManager is now independent to be initialized before/after setting adapter.\r\n- Fixed #365 - Fixed condition for showing header.\r\n- Fixed #369 - FastScroller fix - Added OnScrollListener in `onAttachedToWindow()` as counterpart of `onDetachedFromWindow()`, when ViewPager Adapter is changed at runtime.\r\n- Fixed #371 - Bug in positions calculation in `clearAllBut()`.\r\n- Fixed #372 - `clearAllBut()` clears everything when no view type is specified (now Scrollable items are retained as Javadoc states).\r\n- Fixed #373 - _java.util.ConcurrentModificationException_ with Undo after multiple rapid swipe removals.\r\n\r\n### DemoApp\r\n- Modified demoApp to not show LayoutInfo at each use case.\r\n- Fixed _ButterKnife_ binding.\r\n- Updated _Robolectric_ test library to v3.3.2 to support API 25.\r\n- Added unit tests for `updateDataSet()`.\r\n- Added unit tests for `clearAllBut()`.\r\n- Better Toolbar Styles for API preLollipop.\r\n- Adapted the demoApp to the new `FlexibleItemDecoration` and fixed some bugs around.\r\n\r\n> :information_source: **Note:**\r\n> - Sample App has new package signature, please manually uninstall the previous to avoid duplication.\r\n> - If swipe does not properly animate: please be sure that FrontView is at lower level in the layout to support API < 21."}

See demoApp in Async Filter example to compare the 2 solutions: **the default solution results faster at least of the double!**\r\n- Added methods `clear()` and `clearAllBut(viewTypesToRetain)`, `addItem(item)`, `shouldNotifyParentOnClick()`, `getAllBoundViewHolders()`, see #201.\r\n- Resolves #227 - Elevated header items and Elevated sticky header items.\r\n- Resolves #248 - Surgery precision for transparency and elevation for sticky headers.\r\n- Resolves #228 - No XML layout configuration for sticky headers.\r\n- Resolves #168 - Added Info log for parameters and listeners initialization (to see, enable logs as usual) and added version log at startup and Info on animation when changing LayoutManager.\r\n- Runtime background, changing state has short enter-exit fade animation.\r\n- Selection methods `clearAll()` and `selectAll()` don't notify change anymore.\r\n- Imported the last ActivatedPosition in the `ActionModeHelper`, which has a new method: `getActivatedPosition()`.\r\n- Optimized selection coherence for a parent with a selected sub item at any level.\r\n- Reviewed how the internal `Handler` can be overridden: new internal class `HandlerCallback` has been created.\r\n- Upgrade to API 25 and Android Studio project to 2.2.3.\r\n- Reviewed Java Doc.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Fixed #184 - Problem with endless scrolling and LOAD_MORE_RESET delay.\r\n- Fixed #191 - AsyncFilter fatal error (Empty string will skip the search).\r\n- Fixed #210 - Problem with item content change animation.\r\n- Resolved the high delay for scroll animation on the first visible item after rotation.\r\n- Fixed collapsing bug for a parent with selected sub items.\r\n- Fixed #229 - Calling `hideAllHeaders()` might lead to NullPointerException (Fixed NPE and modified behavior when hiding headers: now, _it doesn't disable anymore the sticky flag_)\r\n- Fixed #244 - Header item doesn't swap if it matches with the first layout position.\r\n- Fixed #265 - UndoHelper dismissed quickly with SnackBar predefined lengths.\r\n- Fix for `adjustSelection()` when adding new items and some items are already selected.\r\n- Decided to adopt Solution 2 for scrolling animation; Solution 1 has been removed. Fixed a couple of scrolling animation issues, now scrolling are animated properly in all situations. Scrollable Headers will now scroll animate. Scrollable Footers cannot scroll animate, when inserted the very first time.\r\n\r\n### Demo App\r\n- Added example with ViewPager.\r\n- Added example for Item Model Holder.\r\n- Added option for DiffUtil in Async Filter example, to compare the 2 solutions implemented. (Refreshing the some lists will update the subtitle of the items, with the numbers of the refreshes).\r\n- Modified demoApp to showcase Scrollable Expandable Headers and Footers.\r\n- Modified demoApp to showcase the new Endless Scroll.\r\n- Removed some calls of deprecated methods.\r\n"}

Creating the `UndoHelper` instance, the value will be set to `false` automatically.\r\n- Refactored `shouldAnimate` default value from `true` to `false`. Items are not animated anymore by default, you need to enable the scrolling animations with `.setAnimationOnScrolling(true)`.\r\n- When `setOnlyEntryAnimation()` is set true, `shouldAnimate` is automatically set true, however when the screen is filled with last visible item, `shouldAnimate` is again false.\r\n- Marked some methods with `//TODO: deprecation?`. Those methods are under evaluation and could disappear in the final release.\r\n- Enabled `shouldMoveItem()` callback in `OnItemMoveListener`.\r\n- Deprecated removeItemWithDelay() with 'resetLayoutAnimation' param.\r\n- Deprecated `getAnimators()` in favour of the new method `scrollAnimators()` in `FlexibleViewHolder`.\r\n- Deprecated `animateView()` method, now it is automatically called from the adapter.\r\n- Deprecated/Moved all add animation methods from Adapter into `AnimatorHelper`.\r\n\r\n**DividerItemDecoration**\r\n- Added new method `withOffset()`.\r\n- Fixing NPE when no divider is provided.\r\n- Fixed normal item offset.\r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Added `@since` for all methods.\r\n- Added new method `getSectionItemPositions()`. It resolves #132.\r\n- Added new method `setAnimateToLimit()`.\r\n- Improved performance while filtering high numbers of items. This resolves #133 part 1: call `notifyDataSetChanged()`. Animation during filtering will be performed if the total items are below the limit of 600 (modifiable value) \"_current items_\" OR \"_filtered items_\"; Above this limit, `notifyDataSetChanged()` will be called with no animation. **Note:** `updateDataSet()` is also affected by this limit, it improves performance during the refresh operation with big list.\r\n- Option to display entry animation only. See #125.\r\n- Method in `FlexibleViewHolder.setDragHandleView()` is not final anymore!\r\n- Improvement performance when resetting filter flags for Expandables.\r\n- Upgrade to Android N (API 24), SupportLib 24.0.0, Java8.\r\n- Reviewed the comments for AutoMap.\r\n- Added new method `setNotifyMoveOfFilteredItems()`.\r\n- Experimental: Added AsyncTask with synchronization animations. Fixed #133 part 2: AsyncFilter. Really lot of items can be filtered in a very short time. Adapter need to be configured accordingly, new Fragment in the demoApp helps to understand how to.\r\n- Experimental: `updateDataSet()` is now run Asynchronously too.\r\n- Experimental: Improved performance when `collapseAll()` with big list.\r\n- Experimental: Improved performance on `showAllHeader()` and `hideAllHeaders()`.\r\n- Added Payload enumeration, this resolves #134.\r\n- New methods in `Utils` class `findFirst/LastCompletelyVisibleItemPosition()`.\r\n- #144 - Adapter initialization and `updateDataSet()` with no notifyItemXXX() on headers.\r\n- #146 - Improved calls to `setDisplayHeadersAtStartUp()` and `showAllHeaders()` to avoid duplication of headers by a non correct initialization. As consequence 2 effects are now possible when calling `setDisplayHeadersAtStartUp()` read method comment, documentation will follow.\r\n- Adapter can be initialized with a null or empty list: `addItems()` can be safely called, but no scrolling animation on loading can be performed.\r\n- Expand items at startup can now expand all Levels of Expandable, if expanded is initially set true. `updateDataSet()` is also compatible with the last status of sub levels.\r\n- Method `getItemId()` now returns `item.hashCode()` of the current position.\r\n- Added `stableIds` to the `FlexibleAdapter` constructor.\r\n- Added AnimationDuration (configurable) for Drag and Swipe.\r\n- #151 - Added `SmoothScrollStaggeredLayoutManager` + configurable millisecondsPerInch.\r\n- Added `setUseStepDelay()` to synchronize the animations all together at startup.\r\n- Added `animators()` method in `FlexibleViewHolder` for scroll animations.\r\n- Added `FlexibleItemAnimator` class and `AnimatedViewHolder` interface for add/remove animations.\r\n- Added `AnimatorHelper`.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**\r\n- Fixed #130 - An unnecessary call to super.onBindViewHolder() caused loop-calls throwing StackOverflowError. As consequence, method `onLoadMore()` is now protected to be manually called _only_ when METHOD B (binding items in classic way) is implemented.\r\n- Fixed #128 - `getStickySectionHeadersHolder()` should return a ViewGroup with LayoutParams coherent and initialized by the user who knows how these params has to be initialized. An exception will be raised if params are nulls.\r\n- Fixed #126 - `onUpdateEmptyView()` is not being correctly called in `updateDataSet() if size > 0`.\r\n- Fixed #121 - Sticky header glitch when header layout has height set to \"wrap_content\"\r\n- Modified FastScroller bubble padding.\r\n- Fixed #143 - `calculatePositionFor()` doesn't work correctly when used for `addItem()`.\r\n- Fixed #142 - 1st item is displayed under sticky header at start up and after `updateDataSet()`.\r\n- Fixed #139 - Sticky header is not resized on automatic configuration change.\r\n- Fixed #135 - The AsyncTask changes made obsolete the fix of missing parenthesis generating a NPE.\r\n- Fixed filter: when no headers are displayed, headers were displayed too. Now the result is coherent with the last state.\r\n- Fixed some NPEs when null is passed to the constructor.\r\n- Fixed scrolling animation flags.\r\n- Fixed #148 - Support for Drag&Drop in GridLayout with Automatic header linkage and headers rebound.\r\n- Fixed #143 - `calculatePositionFor()` doesn't work correctly when used with `addItem()`.\r\n- Fixed #161 - ContextThemeWrapper cannot be cast to Activity when \"theme\" attribute is used in the layout in combination with `getStickySectionHeadersHolder()`.\r\n- Fixed #173 - Inconsistency detected with asynchronous item update.\r\n- When sticky header is enabled, element header at position 0, can now be dragged: layout for sticky header is cleared out, before it was not possible.\r\n\r\n**Demo App**\r\n- BackPressed now goes back to overall View. App entry fade animation?\r\n- StaggeredLayout is the default at startUp.\r\n- Using Method B to bind the FragmentOverall instead of the AutoMap view item interfaces.\r\n- Fixed bug that triggered the filter when searchView is initially opened.\r\n- Experimental: Added a real(!) `SplashActivity`.\r\n- Added new `FragmentAsyncFilter`, here you can customize the Adapter and the database dynamically.\r\n- Added `DatabaseType` enumeration and created `ConfigurationDatabase`.\r\n- Changed layout for drawer and updated the menu with check boxes.\r\n- Reviewed menu items options with check boxes.\r\n- Added menu item for toggleFastScroller()\r\n- Added menu items persistent through some example fragments.\r\n  - For update data set (refresh to see different result);\r\n  - For scrolling animation (reopen the page from the drawer menu to see different result).\r\n- More JUnit test for ItemComparator\r\n- Fixed NPE when closing app before the execution of Runnable.\r\n- Resolved the problem when Layout for sticky header is customized and the header disappeared.\r\n- Added example for Item Animators and Scroll Animations, reviewed the whole Demo App to fullfil the new requirements for animations.\r\n"}

Refactoring** (Changes that you have to take care from all previous versions)\r\n- Refactored class signature for `IHeader` and `IExpandable` and their abstract implementation, [see #117].\r\n- Refactored method `moveItem()` to `swapItem()`.\r\n- Separated the initialization of expanded items at start up [see #86]: `expandItemsAtStartUp()` must be explicitly called by the user in Activity creation phase, `expandItemsAtStartUp()` method now uses the existent `expand()` method with initialization info.\r\n- Items are _NOT_ Draggable and Swipeable by default.\r\n- Experimenting `TreeSet` instead of `ArrayList` for `mSelectedPositions`. As consequence `getSelectedPositions()` returns a _copied_ List from the Set (already sorted, no duplication)!\r\n- Deprecated method `addSection()` with refHeader, will be removed from next release.\r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Dragging and swiping can be enabled by type [see #80].\r\n- Alpha animation, when enabling / disabling sticky headers.\r\n- Added new method `getItemTouchHelperCallback()` to customize Swipe and Drag behaviors.\r\n- Added new method `addSection()` with Comparator object.\r\n- Added new method `moveItem()` that simply moves an item without swapping it.\r\n- Added new method `calculatePositionFor()` useful for new items of every type, a custom `Comparator` is needed.\r\n- Improved method `addItemToSection()` see JavaDoc.\r\n- Improved method `updateDataSet()`, optionally items can be animated, when `false` a `notifyDataSetChanged()` will be executed.\r\n- Added 2 new overload methods for `expand()` series [see #110].\r\n- Added class `UndoHelper.SimpleActionListener` to simplify the development.\r\n- Added class `DrawableUtils` to manage the background Drawables at runtime without XML configuration [see #35].\r\n- Added new base interface `OnActionStateListener` for `OnItemMoveListener` and `OnItemSwipeListener` to overcome the drag issue with the `SwipeRefreshLayout`, [see #104 and #83].\r\n- Added possibility to change mode how `DividerItemDecorator` is drawn, over or (default) underneath the item [see #106].\r\n- Added `applyAndAnimateMovedItems()` when using `animateTo()` (in filter and `updateDataSet()`).\r\n- Full support for `StaggeredGridLayout` [see #107].\r\n- Better selection management: made public `addSelection()`, `removeSelection()`, the new 2 methods don't notify any change as `toggleSelection()` does.\r\n- `Utils.colorAccent` is now public.\r\n- `onUpdateEmptyView()` is now called only if there was a change from 0 / to 0 itemCount [see #113].\r\n- Chaining the Adapter for all initialization and configuration methods (sets).\r\n- Upgrade to SupportLib 23.4.0.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**\r\n- Fixed headers showing after rotation [see #88].\r\n- Fixed `addItemToSection` when Header is hidden: item is now added to the unique visible list.\r\n- Temporary solution to improve ViewHolder with sticky behaviour, (user has to pass `true` as new parameter to the FVH super.constructor). [see #78, #79 and #92].\r\n- Removed useless call in `onChanged()`, causing duplication of subItems when updating the data set [see #95 and #96].\r\n- Fixed hidden status when removing a Header item.\r\n- Fixed Item does not updated after `updateDataSet()` [see #94].\r\n- Fixed NPE bug during filter and null subList [see #103].\r\n- Fixed NPE on originalText in `Utils.hightlightText()` [see #112].\r\n- Fixed expansion status after filtering expandable items.\r\n- Fixed animation changes when calling method `animateTo()`.\r\n- Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException with StaggeredGridLayoutManager [see #87, part of changes of #107].\r\n- Adjusted selection flags when removing items and fixed small bug when restoring items after applying the filter and vice-versa.\r\n- Method `onUpdateEmptyView()` is now called when passing null or empty new list in `updateDataSet()`.\r\n- Filter on restore instance state bug [see #111].\r\n- Fixed header View params when higher than Item view params [see P.R. #116].\r\n- Fixed Constraint on `FlexibleViewHolder` when using StickyHeader functionality, as consequence changed class signature of `IHeader` item interface and its implementation. Also changed the class signature of `IExpandable` item interface and its implementation to have a ViewHolder of type `ExpandableViewHolder` as well [see #117].\r\n\r\n**Demo App**\r\n- Added new example Fragment for StaggeredLayout with multiple functionalities:\r\n  - merge/split items at runtime (position are recalculated);\r\n  - move item with animation taking care of the groups using the new function `calculatePositionFor()`;\r\n  - automatic sorting when adding new items using the new function `addItemToSection()`;\r\n  - example of Comparator object;\r\n  - change Drawable background at runtime, maintaining the ripple effect (no XML is used).\r\n- Fix for SwipeRefreshLayout to be displayed on the top of StickyHeaders Layout [see #83].\r\n- SwipeRefresh with StickyHeader is not compatible with Dragging feature, added comments in the layout to show the difference #83: User must disable the SwipeRefreshLayout programmatically, to do it, I added a new callback function and relative listener `OnActionStateListener`.\r\n- Adjusted demo App behavior when filtering with Endless Scrolling.\r\n- Some others minor changes.\r\n"}

Headers are clickable when sticky! Thanks to @farfromrefug. StickyHeaders can now benefit of the existing click listeners in `FlexibleViewHolder` [See #41]. Pay attention at the method `getStickySectionHeadersHolder()`.\n- `IHeader` item can be combined with `IExpandable` item to make a section expandable with header.\n- Adding items with new headers, headers are also shown.\n- Added `AbstractExpandableHeaderItem`. \n- Added a new Wiki page about how to implement sections with sticky headers and expandable sections. Direct link: [Headers and Sections](https://github.com/davideas/FlexibleAdapter/wiki/5.x-%7C-Headers-and-Sections).\n- Added new methods _getItemCountOfTypesUntil(), removeItemsOfType(), hasNewSearchText()_.\n- Multiple code improvements with **SonarQube** tool, thanks to @georgekankava.\n\n**Fixes**\n- Fixed NPE in `isEnabled(position)` when position is unknown.\n- Fixed header linkage when deleting/restore items with header. _It's important now that all sectionable items must initialize the own header at startup_.\n- Bug fixing on SearchView and FilterMethods.\n- Fixed view activation elevation [See #38].\n- Fixed adapter item animation at startup.\n\n**Demo App**\n- New example app supporting multiple fragments [See #19].\n- Added an example of `FlexibleItemHolder` to use simultaneously the same _modelData_ object in multiple RecyclerView/Adapters.\n- Adapted code for Expandable Sections with headers. Enabled demo option for `FragmentExpandableSections`.\n- Demo app has more clear DatabaseService. It shows how to create item interfaces.\n- FlipView animation for Fragments.\n- Unfortunately the demo app has a _known_ bug on FastScroller when changing Fragment, but FastScroller is planned to be changed.\n"}

**Sticky Header** functionality [See #32].\r\n- New **IHeader** interface has been added to identify the fact the item is a Header item, as consequence, **ISectionable** interface now has to be assigned to the items(!!) in order for them to hold the reference to the _IHeader_ item.\r\n- Headers are shown/hidden during expand/collapse if they belongs to children.\r\n- Headers work in combination with restore items, in all situations (... the ones I have foreseen).\r\n- Headers can also be deleted and restored in any situations: they are re-linked all the time with the item below it.\r\n- Headers can be dragged, swapped and receive the new swapped item.\r\n- Dragging items, it automatically re-links the header in almost all situations (the logic can be improved).\r\n- Support for **Orphan Headers**: deleting all items under a header, when the headers are visible and hidden, it makes the header orphan, an option has been added to delete the orphan headers as well. Currently the orphan headers, ones hidden, cannot be shown anymore (they are lost, food for the gc), you should re-link them manually.\r\n\r\n**Filter**\r\n- Added **IFilterable** item interface. New clean way to filter items, Items can now implement _filter()_ method in order to be collected for the filtered list.\r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- FlexibleAdapter is not anymore abstract.\r\n- Added support for AndroidStudio 2.0 InstantRun: updated Gradle plugin.\r\n- Added support for _isSelectable()_ it should now be usable.\r\n- Added methods _addSubItems()_ and _addAllSubItemsFrom()_.\r\n- Transformed all \"add\" methods in a chain of calls.\r\n- Added minimal support for _isEnabled()_.\r\n- Added a nice _DividerItemDecorator_ into library [See #33].\r\n- Completely changed the logic how a removed item saves restoration info (now a removed item has an internal reference that should never fail, _adjustRemoved()_ became obsolete and has been removed).\r\n- Included in the library Utils class the method _setHighlightText()_ Useful to highlight text coming from a search action.\r\n- Made a better use of Payload when _notifyItemChanged_ is triggered.\r\n- Restoring all items, now it's much faster in case of restoreSelection is enabled.\r\n- Cast optimization: removed unnecessary 8 casts by changing some parameters of methods from generic object T to _IFlexible_ and _IExpandable_ types, this should be transparent.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**\r\n- Fixed crash problem with SelectAll and improved method logic.\r\n- Fixed last expandable item in _expandAll()_.\r\n- Fixed automap when not using it.\r\n- Fixed others minor bugs.\r\n- Added Copyright notice on the top of the files.\r\n\r\n**Refactor**\r\n- Modified the signature of _getCurrentChildren()_ to accept an IExpandable object.\r\n- Renamed _IFlexibleItem_ to _IFlexible_.\r\n- Moved into _common_ folder the _SmoothScrollLinearLayoutManager_ class.\r\n"}
