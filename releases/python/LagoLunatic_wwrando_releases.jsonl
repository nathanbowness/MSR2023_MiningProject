enabled, you can now choose for the number of required dungeons to be anywhere from 1 to 6, instead of only 4 dungeons.\r\n* You can now choose to randomize the Hero's Shield instead of starting the game with it.\r\n* Custom model authors can now change the colors of the sword's slash trail, the boomerang's trail, and arrow trails.\r\n* Slightly increased the speed at which Link sidles along walls.\r\n* The Nintendo Gallery is now unlocked from the start of the game.\r\n* Added a counter showing the number of Tingle Statues you own to the Quest Status screen. This allows you to easily check how many you've picked up without going to Tingle Island. (This replaces the Treasure Chart counter on that screen, but you can still view the number of charts you own in the charts menu.)\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of new player models made by members of the community: Zelda, Postbox Man, Malon, Dark Linka, Navirou, and Niko. Download all the models here: https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Moved the inter-dungeon warp pot in Earth Temple from the fourth room to the second room so that it can be accessed with fewer items than before.\r\n* The option to remove the title/ending videos and the enemy palette randomizer no longer affect the permalink.\r\n* For progress items that have extra duplicates, the randomizer now only guarantees that the required number of them are in progression locations. For example, out of the four Empty Bottles, one will be placed in a progression location if it's needed, but the other three can be placed in either progression or non-progression locations, as if those three were non-progress items.\r\n* Defeating the Mighty Darknuts in the Master Sword chamber with no weapon besides Skull Hammer can no longer be required by the logic.\r\n* Defeating Big Octos that have 12 eyes with arrows can now only be required if you have either the 60 arrow quiver or Light Arrows.\r\n* Renamed \"Randomized Sword\" to \"No Starting Sword\" and \"Start with Sword\" to \"Start with Hero's Sword\".\r\n* Renamed a few item locations to be more clear.\r\n* The item given for hitting Orca 500 times can now only be consumable items such as rupees (previously it could be anything except progress items).\r\n* The Windfall bomb shop owner now sells bomb refills at reasonable prices from the start of the game, instead of setting the prices to be unaffordable before you own Nayru's Pearl.\r\n* The progress bar now updates incrementally as the randomized ISO is being written.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fixed a bug where release executables were not properly encrypted, allowing them to be extracted and used to generate spoiler logs for non-spoiler log seeds.\r\n* Fixed a bug where saving the game inside the Pirate Ship on Windfall would cause you to appear on Southern Fairy Island when you reload the game.\r\n* Fixed a bug where certain types of items could be incorrectly counted as progress items regardless of settings if you chose to start with at least 1 of that item but not all of them (e.g. Empty Bottles).\r\n* Fixed a bug where custom player models with tons of color presets built in would cause the randomizer's UI to be very slow when changing custom color options.\r\n* Fixed an error occurring during randomization if your seed name was exactly 42 characters long (the maximum seed length).\r\n* Fixed an error occurring when using a custom ship model that uses the same sail texture as the vanilla ship model.\r\n* Fixed a vanilla bug where mini-boss music would continue to play even after leaving the room if you killed the mini-boss with Light Arrows, or left the room without killing the mini-boss at all.\r\n* Fixed various bugs that could occur when the Fire Mountain and Ice Ring Isle cave entrances were randomized.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LagoLunatic/wwrando/releases/38507774/reactions", "total_count": 13, "+1": 13, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

The model's author can optionally include sets of colors with the model that can be selected via a dropdown in the randomizer's UI.\r\n  * For example, the vanilla Link model now comes with the following color presets: Dark Link, Smash Dark Link, Green Link, Red Link, Blue Link, Purple Link, Shadow Link.\r\n* Custom player models can now optionally include a custom ship model for the player to ride.\r\n* Custom player models can now allow recoloring the player's sclera.\r\n* Added an option to remove all music from the game.\r\n* Added an option to disable custom item models that come with custom player models.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of new player models made by members of the community: Red, DS Link, CJ, Inteleon, Linka, Young Link, and Vacation Link. Download all the models here: https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* 14 item locations previously under the Miscellaneous category are now under a new Island Puzzles category.\r\n* The Pirate Ship item location on Windfall is now part of the Minigames category.\r\n* The trigger for the Phantom Ganon fight at Forsaken Fortress no longer extends infinitely upwards above Phantom Ganon like it did in vanilla. This means you can fight Helmaroc King without first defeating Phantom Ganon (which can now be required by the logic).\r\n* Removed the minor cutscenes in DRC, FW, TotG, and ET where the camera panned around the hub room.\r\n* Prevented the cutscene where Ivan tells you about Mrs. Marie's birthday from triggering automatically as you leave the school. (You can still trigger it manually by talking to Ivan, in case you want to get the unrandomized Joy Pendant in the tree.)\r\n* When the Swift Sail tweak is enabled, the ship's cruising speed is now also increased.\r\n* When the randomizer runs out of items to place (e.g. because you started with extra gear) it will now place various consumables randomly to fill the locations up, instead of only using red rupees.\r\n* Hyrule Castle now has Moblins and Darknuts in it. (Killing them is not necessary to progress like in vanilla.)\r\n* Outset will now play its alternate theme once you've opened a certain chest.\r\n* Drastically improved the performance of recoloring the player model preview image in the randomizer's UI, especially when lots of different color options are changed from the model's defaults.\r\n* Added more custom color options for the vanilla Link model.\r\n* The \"Generate Spoiler Log\" option is now worded as \"Do Not Generate Spoiler Log\" and unchecked by default. Its effect is the same, just flipped.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.7.0 where slightly recoloring certain grey colors on player models would make them appear as extremely saturated colors.\r\n* Fixed a vanilla bug where respawning Magtails that are killed by shooting them in the head with Light Arrows would not respawn.\r\n* Fixed a vanilla bug where the stone faces in the Tall Basement Room of Wind Temple that spawn Bokoblins wouldn't allow the chest in that room to spawn until you look at the empty spot where the stone face fell and broke apart after you kill its Bokoblin.\r\n* Potentially fixed a vanilla issue when sailing on the sea for a long time that could result in the game running out of memory and reloading the sea with a fade to white.\r\n* Fixed Big Octo eyes not changing color very much when destroyed if the enemy palette randomizer was on.\r\n* Fixed Mighty Darknut and Phantom Ganon's capes sometimes being transparent when the enemy palette randomizer was on.\r\n* Fixed the floor of the roof of Forsaken Fortress's tower being recolored along with Helmaroc King when the enemy palette randomizer was on.\r\n* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.5.0 where the Grappling Hook's hook would visually appear slightly detached from the rope when Link holds it at his side.\r\n* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.5.0 where the Grappling Hook used by Salvage Corp would be the wrong color when using a player model that comes with a custom model for the Grappling Hook.\r\n"}

Download all the models here: https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* The logic can now require you to use the Hookshot to skip fighting the Earth Temple Stalfos mini-boss fight when you don't have a sword.\r\n* Killing the respawning Darknuts in Wind Temple, Stone Watcher Island, and Overlook Island can now be required by the logic when farming for Knight's Crests.\r\n* The item given by the final withered tree is now properly launched out with momentum like in the vanilla game instead of simply falling down.\r\n* Whether you choose for the player to wear casual clothes or hero's clothes is now always respected. This option now overrides Second Quest forcing you into casual clothes, as well as loading a save file where you started with the opposite option selected.\r\n* Renamed several Windfall item locations to be more descriptive.\r\n* Removing the videos from the title screen and ending is now optional instead of always being enabled.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fixed a vanilla softlock when re-entering Forsaken Fortress via the left half of the big door on the second floor.\r\n* Fixed a vanilla bug where Morths that fall out of bounds would not be considered dead. They are now automatically killed after falling out of bounds. In practice this should fix chests not spawning/doors not opening in locations where Wizzrobes spawn Morths: the Pawprint Isle Wizzrobe Cave, the Tall Basement Room in Wind Temple, and one of the rooms in the Overlook Island secret cave.\r\n* Fixed a vanilla softlock where cutting a Stalfos in half and then killing its upper half with Light Arrows would not also kill its lower half, making it impossible to kill all enemies in the room. (Because this bug is now fixed, the randomizer's workaround to avoid this where Stalfos were made completely immune to Light Arrows has been reverted, so Stalfos can be killed with them again like in vanilla.)\r\n* Fixed a vanilla bug where non-respawning Miniblins would not be fully considered dead when killed with Light Arrows. This affects Miniblins in the Shark Island cave, and the first Miniblin in the Crescent Moon Island submarine.\r\n* Fixed a bug in the vanilla code where Jalhalla would not consider his spawned Poes dead and decrease his HP if they are killed with Light Arrows.\r\n* Fixed memory corruption that occurred when the randomizer's custom code spawned the item given by the final withered tree, which was likely the cause of extremely rare and inconsistent bugs happening then or shortly after, such as the game softlocking or crashing.\r\n* Fixed a bug where Beedle would not tell you the total price he is willing to pay you for spoils you offer him.\r\n* When sequence breaking DRC and going backwards, the game will no longer stutter for a second when you approach the back side of a door that has a boulder on the other side of it while the randomizer's custom actor is deleting the boulder.\r\n* Fixed a bug where being sucked into the center of the Outset whirlpool would not stop the whirlpool music from playing.\r\n* Fixed colored lines appearing on the vanilla Link model when you select certain custom color combinations."}

find the normal bombs item to access them.\r\n* Item location hints will no longer hint at the location of boss reward items when race mode is on.\r\n* Each fishman hint is now duplicated about the

You can also choose to combine this with the Dungeon Entrance Randomizer so that dungeon entrances may lead into secret caves and vice versa.\r\n* Implemented Race Mode. In this mode, 4 of the 6 dungeons are randomly chosen, and the bosses of those dungeons drop an item which is definitely required to beat the game. The 4 chosen dungeons are marked on the sea chart. The 2 dungeons that were not chosen will not have any progress items anywhere in them, so you don't even need to enter those dungeons.\r\n* Sped up several animations, including the grappling animation, block pushing/pulling animations, and climbing animations.\r\n* Implemented a Key Bag, accessible on the Quest Status screen, which tells you how many unused small keys you currently have and whether you have the big key or not for each dungeon. With this, you don't need to be inside the dungeon to know what keys you have.\r\n* Medli and Makar now follow you out of warp pots within their respective dungeons, so you don't need to manually carry them through the whole dungeon every time you re-enter the dungeon.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of new player models made by members of the community: Goku, Fox Link, Zora Link, and Poor Mila. Plus custom voices to go with the Medli model. Download all the models here: https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Changed the way the randomizer decides how to place progress items, so that the bias towards locations accessible early on is now less extreme than before.\r\n* Savage Labyrinth is now a separate progression option, instead of being under Combat Secret Caves. The Sinking Ships minigame is also now a separate progression option, instead of being under Minigames.\r\n* Changed some location categories: Lenzo's two chests, the Windfall transparent chest, and the item Zunari gives you after you stock the Exotic Flower are now all under Short Sidequests.\r\n* Added support for custom models to mask parts of the hand texture for custom colors.\r\n* Added an option to the UI to disable custom voices that come with custom models.\r\n* Removed a few more unnecessary short cutscenes from dungeons.\r\n* Changed the distribution of randomized rupees so that silver rupees are no longer the most common, and purple and orange rupees are now more common.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fixed a vanilla crash that would occur when jump attacking on top of the Ghost Ship chest.\r\n* Fixed very old versions of Dolphin not being able to boot the randomized game up.\r\n* Fixed the normal item get music playing when you get a song instead of the special music.\r\n* Fixed an error preventing you from choosing Swordless mode and starting with 8 Triforce shards together.\r\n* Fixed an error when Tingle statues appear in Savage Labyrinth."}

randomized into the item pool and can appear anywhere, not just in Tingle Chests.\r\n* The reward Ankle gives you for finding all 5 Tingle Statues is also randomized (under Miscellaneous).\r\n* The special rupee worth 500 rupees Ankle originally gave as a reward is also now randomized into the item pool. (Because this rupee originally looked identical to an orange rupee, it's been changed to cycle through all rupee colors in a rainbow to distinguish it.)\r\n* Tingle Chests now have their contents randomized.\r\n* Tingle Chests can now be made to appear with normal bombs, so using the Tingle Tuner is not required. Also, they now show up on the dungeon's compass.\r\n* Added the ability to show a preview of the selected custom model and colors in the randomizer window.\r\n* Added the ability to load custom voice files along with a custom model.\r\n* Added an option to invert the camera's X axis.\r\n* Added a \"seed hash\" to the name entry screen - two random character names that vary depending on your seed and selected options. Multiple people trying to play the same seed can use this to verify if they really booted the same seed up or not.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of new custom player models made by members of the community: Aryll, Fado, Cheerleader Link, Sans, and Lucario. Download all the models here: <https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models>\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Progress items that don't help you progress with your selected options are no longer considered progress items (e.g. Picto Box when you don't select sidequests). Because there are now less items in the progress item pool, it's now possible to select options that result in fewer progress locations than in previous versions if you want - for example, you can select just Great Fairies, Free Gifts, Minigames, and Mail for 23 locations, while previously that wouldn't have been nearly enough.\r\n* Removed the item get animation for the first time you get each type of spoil.\r\n* Several changes and fixes to progression logic and location names.\r\n* A 64-bit build of the randomizer is now offered, which should be less likely to trigger false positives in antivirus programs than the 32-bit build.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fixed various bugs that could result in the randomizer throwing error messages on some Dungeons-only seeds due to the item placement logic backing itself into a dead-end.\r\n* Fixed a bug causing the dungeon in the Tower of the Gods sector to be less likely to have required items in it than the other dungeons.\r\n* Fixed Maggie's father not giving you red rupees for skull necklaces if you try to skip his dialogue too quickly.\r\n* Fixed the normal item get music playing when you get a Goddess Pearl instead of the special music.\r\n* Fixed a crash that occurred during the auction on real hardware.\r\n* Fixed softlocks that could occur when you sequence break in DRC and then go backwards, then open a door that has a boulder blocking it from the wrong side. Now instead of the player being stuck walking into the boulder forever, the boulder will despawn.\r\n* Fixed Orca's dialogue after he teaches you the Hurricane Spin being repeated an extra time."}

(This mode doesn't have the same changes that Swordless mode does.)\r\n* Added an option to skip the rematch bosses in Ganon's Tower.\r\n* Implemented turning while swinging on ropes.\r\n* Added skin color to customizable player colors.\r\n\r\nThe Tetra and Medli player models have been updated as well, make sure to re-download them if you intend to use them: https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* You now start with Song of Passing.\r\n* Separated Phantom Ganon 2 from Phantom Ganon 3 - so if you have Light Arrows, you can skip doing the maze entirely.\r\n* Your magic meter is now refilled to full when you load a save.\r\n* Made all chests open quickly, without the dramatic dark room animation.\r\n* Dungeon maps and compasses can now be dropped by the dungeon boss even when key-lunacy is off.\r\n* Removed the camera panning around the bidders at the start of each auction.\r\n* Removed Outset and DRC invisible walls that arbitrarily prevented sequence breaking.\r\n* Removed the blue main quest markers from the sea chart.\r\n* Adjusted the UI to work better on low resolution monitors.\r\n* Custom player colors can now alternatively be input as hex codes.\r\n* Numerous changes and fixes to progression logic and location names.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Greatly reduced the filesize of custom player models and recolored player textures, hopefully fixing crashes that could occur sometimes.\r\n* Fixed most items shooting out of Gohdan's nose too far.\r\n* Fixed many randomized items on the ground not being picked up properly when you grab them with the boomerang.\r\n* Fixed small keys dropped by a boss in key-lunacy not being added to your inventory if the small key was for the same dungeon as the one you're in.\r\n* Fixed Picto Box related things acting already completed in New Game+.\r\n\r\nAs always, if you have any questions or are looking for people to play with, feel free to join the official Wind Waker Randomizer Discord server: https://discord.gg/r2963mt"}
