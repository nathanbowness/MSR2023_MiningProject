(#80)\n- Colorful and formatted output from the `list` command via the `rich` package is available.\n### Changed\n- For filtering the output of the `list` command, the `-f` option can now be specified multiple times with one argument each (previously, multiple arguments could be passed but when using `-f` multiple times, the last occurrence would overrule the previous ones). The filters are combined. The long option is called `--filter` (singular). (#83)\n- If the `list -f` option is used with a filter for frequency, start, or end, the `-r/--recurrent-only` option is automatically added. (#83)\n- If the `update` command is used with the option `--start` and/or `--end`, it is assumed to operate on recurrent entries. (#84)\n- Update dependencies `argcomplete` and `tinydb`. (#81,#85,#87)\n- Clarify command line help.\n### Removed\n- Remove `convert-periods-to-pocket` command. (#78)\n"}
