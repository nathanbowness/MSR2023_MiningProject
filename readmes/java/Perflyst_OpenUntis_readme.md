# OpenUntis

Fork of [SapuSeven BetterUntis-Legacy](https://github.com/SapuSeven/BetterUntis-Legacy).  
An alternative FLOSS Android client for the Untis timetable system.

OpenUntis will be replaced with the [new BetterUntis](https://github.com/SapuSeven/BetterUntis/). If you want to contribute or add new features please do it there.

## Proxied WebUntis

For more privacy (no transmission of IP address or useragent) you can use following domain instead of the normal webuntis.com domains.  
Please replace `server` with your webuntis server: `server.openuntis.perflyst.de`

Example:  
`demo.webuntis.com` -> `demo.openuntis.perflyst.de`

Please note: I have full control over the connection and therefore I could inject malicious code, read your password or analyze the data you transmit.
I do not process nor look into any of your data which is transmitted. **Access logs are disabled!** Only **error logs are enabled**, no user or password is ever logged, in order to debug issues which may occur. They are **deleted** at least **after 7 days**.

To setup this yourself, check the [proxied WebUntis documentation](https://github.com/Perflyst/OpenUntis/blob/master/docs/setup-proxy.md).

## Anti Features
webuntis.com, non-free network service


## Installation
If there are release builds available, you can download them from the [release page](https://github.com/Perflyst/OpenUntis/releases).
Alternatively, you can build the app yourself.
