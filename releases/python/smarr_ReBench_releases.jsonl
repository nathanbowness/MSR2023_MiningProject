It is highly [configurable](https://rebench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/), [documented](https://rebench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [successfully used](https://github.com/smarr/ReBench#use-in-academia).\r\n\r\nThis 1.0 release does not signify any new major features, but instead marks a\r\npoint where ReBench has been stable and relieable for a long time.\r\n\r\n#### ReBench is designed to\r\n\r\n - enable reproduction of experiments;\r\n - document all benchmark parameters;\r\n - provide a flexible execution model,\r\n   with support for interrupting and continuing benchmarking;\r\n - enable the definition of complex sets of comparisons\r\n   and their flexible execution;\r\n - report results to continuous performance monitoring systems,\r\n   e.g., Codespeed or ReBenchDB;\r\n - provide basic support for building/compiling benchmarks/experiments\r\n   on demand;\r\n - be extensible to parse output of custom benchmark harnesses.\r\n\r\n#### ReBench isn't\r\n\r\n - a framework for microbenchmarks.\r\n   Instead, it relies on existing harnesses and can be extended to parse their\r\n   output.\r\n - a performance analysis tool. It is meant to execute experiments and\r\n   record the corresponding measurements.\r\n - a data analysis tool. It provides only a bare minimum of statistics,\r\n   but has an easily parseable data format that can be processed, e.g., with R.\r\n\r\nTo use ReBench, install it with Python's pip:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install rebench\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nReBench has been used by a number of people over the years, and their feedback and [contributions](https://github.com/smarr/ReBench/graphs/contributors) made it what it is today. Not all of these contributions are recorded, but I'd still like to thank everyone, from the anonymous reviewer of artifacts, to the students who had to wade through bugs and missing documentation.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n### Changes Since 1.0rc2\r\n\r\n - moved CI to use GitHub Actions (#134)\r\n - added testing of Python 3.7 (#121) and ruamel.yaml (#123)\r\n - ensure config is YAML 1.2 compliant (#123)\r\n - added support for ReBenchDB (#129, #130)\r\n \r\n - fixed issues with error reporting (#128)\r\n - fixed handling of input size configuration (#117)"}
