# Twidge
Welcome to Twidge.  Twidge is a tool for interacting with microblogging sites such as Twitter and StatusNet.

Twidge is a full command-line client.  It is designed to be useful when you're sitting at a shell prompt.  It's also designed to work well with the Unix/POSIX/Linux shell scripting environment.  It produces output in well-formed and easily-parsed ways, and has various features for working with piped data.

It can be used to:

* Simply update your own status and following your friends
* Setting status based on system events
* Receiving status updates via email, and sending your friends and your replies to email
* Scheduling status updates for the future
* The sky's the limit!
