Welcome to the v1.0.0 release! Nothing has changed, but we want to start making changes to better integrate with Go module features to improve the accuracy of reported results. We are cutting a v1 release so that any potentially disruptive changes (i.e. flag changes, etc.) don't take anyone by surprise. Non CLI surface changes will continue to be published with minor releases in line with https://go.dev/doc/modules/release-workflow.\r\n\r\nCheers! \ud83c\udf89 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/go-licenses/releases/57064266/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}
