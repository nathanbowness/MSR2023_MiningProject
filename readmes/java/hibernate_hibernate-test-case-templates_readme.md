# Hibernate Test Case Templates

When creating a bug report for any project within the Hibernate family, it's extremely helpful (and, frankly, required)
to have an adequate test case available.  This is obviously important to make reproducing the issue as easy as
possible.  But it's also vital longer-term.  Nearly every bug fix should include a regression test, which frequently is based
on the original reproducer (sometimes, it's the reproducer, verbatim).

To help create useful test cases, we're opening up this repo with various templates.  Please see the READMEs in each
project's subdir for more info.

As always, this is open source for a reason!  If these templates can be improved in any way, please let us know (either
through our JIRA instance or through GitHub Issues).  Better yet, send us a pull request!
