They will always raise an error on failed coercion (flash-gordon)\r\n  Compare:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  # 0.15.0\r\n  Types::Params::Integer.('foo')\r\n  # => \"foo\"\r\n\r\n  # 1.0.0\r\n  Types::Params::Integer.('foo')\r\n  # => Dry::Types::CoercionError: invalid value for Integer(): \"foo\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  To handle coercion errors `Type#call` now yields a block:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  Types::Params::Integer.('foo') { :invalid } # => :invalid\r\n  ```\r\n  This makes work with coercions more straightforward and way faster.\r\n- [BREAKING] Safe types were renamed to Lax, this name better serves their purpose. The previous name is available but prints a warning (flash-gordon)\r\n- [BREAKING] Metadata is now pushed down to the decorated type. It is not likely you will notice a difference but this a breaking change that enables some use cases in rom related to the usage of default types in relations (flash-gordon)\r\n- Nominal types are now completely unconstrained. This fixes some inconsistencies when using them with constraints. `Nominal#try` will always return a successful result, for the previous behavior use `Nominal#try_coerce` or switch to strict types with passing a block to `#call` (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n## Performance improvements\r\n\r\n- During the work on this release, a lot of performance improvements were made. dry-types 1.0 combined with dry-logic 1.0 are multiple times faster than dry-types 0.15 and dry-logic 0.5 for common cases including constraints checking and coercion (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- API for custom constructor types was enhanced. If you pass your own callable to `.constructor` it can have a block in its signature. If a block is passed, you must call it on failed coercion, otherwise raise a type coercion error (flash-gordon)\r\n  Example:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  proc do |input, &block|\r\n    if input.is_a? String\r\n      Integer(input, 10)\r\n    else\r\n      Integer(input)\r\n    end\r\n  rescue ArgumentError, TypeError => error\r\n    if block\r\n      block.call\r\n    else\r\n      raise Dry::Types::CoercionError.new(\r\n        error.message,\r\n        backtrace: error.backtrace\r\n      )\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n  This makes the exception handling your job so that dry-types won't have to catch and re-wrap all possible errors (this is not safe, generally speaking).\r\n- Types now can be converted to procs thus you can pass them as blocks (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  %w(1 2 3).map(&Types::Coercible::Integer)\r\n  # => [1, 2, 3]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n[Compare v0.15.0...v1.0.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-types/compare/v0.15.0...v1.0.0)"}

They are triggered on `Undefined` instead (GustavoCaso + flash-gordon)\r\n- [BREAKING] Support for old hash schemas was fully removed. This makes dry-types not compatible with dry-validation < 1.0 (flash-gordon)\r\n- `Dry::Types.module` is deprecated in favor of `Dry.Types` (flash-gordon)\r\n  Keep in mind `Dry.Types` uses strict types for top-level names, that is after\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  module Types\r\n    include Dry.Types\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n  `Types::Integer` is a strict type. If you want it to be nominal, use `include Dry.Types(default: :nominal)`. See other options below.\r\n- `params.integer` now always converts strings to decimal numbers, this means `09` will be coerced to `9` (threw an error before) (skryukov)\r\n- Ruby 2.3 is EOL and not officially supported. It may work but we don't test it.\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- Improved string representation of types (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  Dry::Types['nominal.integer']\r\n  # => #<Dry::Types[Nominal<Integer>]>\r\n  Dry::Types['params.integer']\r\n  # => #<Dry::Types[Constructor<Nominal<Integer> fn=Dry::Types::Coercions::Params.to_int>]>\r\n  Dry::Types['hash'].schema(age?: 'integer')\r\n  # => #<Dry::Types[Constrained<Schema<keys={age?: Constrained<Nominal<Integer> rule=[type?(Integer)]>}> rule=[type?(Hash)]>]>\r\n  Dry::Types['array<integer>']\r\n  # => #<Dry::Types[Constrained<Array<Constrained<Nominal<Integer> rule=[type?(Integer)]>> rule=[type?(Array)]>]>\r\n  ```\r\n- Options for the list of types you want to import with `Dry.Types` (flash-gordon)\r\n  Cherry-pick only certain types:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  module Types\r\n    include Dry.Types(:strict, :nominal, :coercible)\r\n  end\r\n  Types.constants\r\n  # => [:Strict, :Nominal, :Coercible]\r\n  ```\r\n  Change default top-level types:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  module Types\r\n    include Dry.Types(default: :coercible)\r\n  end\r\n  # => #<Dry::Types[Constructor<Nominal<Integer> fn=Kernel.Integer>]>\r\n  ```\r\n  Rename type namespaces:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  module Types\r\n    include Dry.Types(strict: :Strong, coercible: :Kernel)\r\n  end\r\n  ```\r\n- Optional keys for schemas can be provided with ?-ending symbols (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  Dry::Types['hash'].schema(name: 'string', age?: 'integer')\r\n  ```\r\n- Another way of making keys optional is setting `required: false` to meta. In fact, it is the preferable\r\n  way if you have to store this information in `meta`, otherwise use the Key's API (see below) (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  Dry::Types['hash'].schema(\r\n    name: Dry::Types['string'],\r\n    age: Dry::Types['integer'].meta(required: false)\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n- Key types have API for making keys omittable and back (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  # defining a base schema with optional keys\r\n  lax_hash = Dry::Types['hash'].with_type_transform { |key| key.required(false) }\r\n  # same as\r\n  lax_hash = Dry::Types['hash'].with_type_transform(&:omittable)\r\n\r\n  # keys in user_schema are not required\r\n  user_schema = lax_hash.schema(name: 'string', age: 'integer')\r\n  ```\r\n- `Type#optional?` now recognizes more cases where `nil` is an allowed value (flash-gordon)\r\n- `Constructor#{prepend,append}` with `<<` and `>>` as aliases. `Constructor#append` works the same way `Constructor#constrcutor` does. `Constuctor#prepend` chains functions in the reverse order, see examples (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  to_int = Types::Coercible::Integer\r\n  inc = to_int.append { |x| x + 2 }\r\n  inc.(\"1\") # => \"1\" -> 1 -> 3\r\n\r\n  inc = to_int.prepend { |x| x + \"2\" }\r\n  inc.(\"1\") # => \"1\" -> \"12\" -> 12\r\n  ```\r\n- Partial schema application for cases when you want to validate only a subset of keys (flash-gordon)\r\n  This is useful when you want to update a key or two in an already-validated hash. A perfect example is `Dry::Struct#new` where this feature is now used.\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  schema = Dry::Types['hash'].schema(name: 'string', age: 'integer')\r\n  value = schema.(name: 'John', age: 20)\r\n  update = schema.apply({ age: 21 }, skip_missing: true)\r\n  value.merge(update)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n* `Hash::Map` now behaves as a constrained type if its values are constrained (flash-gordon)\r\n* `coercible.integer` now doesn't blow up on invalid strings (exterm)\r\n\r\n[Compare v0.14.0...v0.15.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-types/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0)"}

You can opt-in the former name with `require 'dry/types/compat/form_types'`. It will be dropped in the next release (ndrluis)\r\n* [BREAKING] The `Int` types was renamed to `Integer`, this was the only type named differently from the standard Ruby classes so it has been made consistent. The former name is available with `require 'dry/types/compat/int'` (GustavoCaso + flash-gordon)\r\n* [BREAKING] Default types are not evaluated on `nil`. Default values are evaluated _only_ if no value were given.\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    type = Types::Strict::String.default(\"hello\")\r\n    type[nil] # => constraint error\r\n    type[] # => \"hello\"\r\n  ```\r\n  This change allowed to greatly simplify hash schemas, make them a lot more flexible yet predictable (see below).\r\n* [BREAKING] `Dry::Types.register_class` was removed, `Dry::Types.register` was made private API, do not register your types in the global `dry-types` container, use a module instead, e.g. `Types` (flash-gordon)\r\n* [BREAKING] Enum types don't accept value index anymore. Instead, explicit mapping is supported, see below (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n* Hash schemas were rewritten. The old API is still around but is going to be deprecated and removed before 1.0. The new API is simpler and more flexible. Instead of having a bunch of predefined schemas you can build your own by combining the following methods:\r\n\r\n  1. `Schema#with_key_transform`\u2014transforms keys of input hashes, for things like symbolizing etc.\r\n  2. `Schema#strict`\u2014makes a schema intolerant to unknown keys.\r\n  3. `Hash#with_type_transform`\u2014transforms member types with an arbitrary block. For instance,\r\n\r\n    ```ruby\r\n    optional_keys = Types::Hash.with_type_transform { |t, _key| t.optional }\r\n    schema = optional_keys.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')\r\n    schema.(name: \"Jane\", age: nil) # => {name: \"Jane\", age: nil}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  Note that by default all keys are required, if a key is expected to absent, add to the corresponding type's meta `omittable: true`:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  intolerant = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String)\r\n  intolerant[{}] # => Dry::Types::MissingKeyError\r\n  tolerant = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String.meta(omittable: true))\r\n  tolerant[{}] # => {}\r\n  tolerant_with_default = Types::Hash.schema(name: Types::Strict::String.meta(omittable: true).default(\"John\"))\r\n  tolerant[{}] # => {name: \"John\"}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The new API is composable in a natural way:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  TOLERANT = Types::Hash.with_type_transform { |t| t.meta(omittable: true) }.freeze\r\n  user = TOLERANT.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')\r\n  user.(name: \"Jane\") # => {name: \"Jane\"}\r\n\r\n  TOLERANT_SYMBOLIZED = TOLERANT.with_key_transform(&:to_sym)\r\n  user_sym = TOLERANT_SYMBOLIZED.schema(name: 'strict.string', age: 'strict.int')\r\n  user_sym.(\"name\" => \"Jane\") # => {name: \"Jane\"}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n* `Types.Strict` is an alias for `Types.Instance` (flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  strict_range = Types.Strict(Range)\r\n  strict_range == Types.Instance(Range) # => true\r\n  ```\r\n* `Enum#include?` is an alias to `Enum#valud?` (d-Pixie + flash-gordon)\r\n* `Range` was added (GustavoCaso)\r\n* `Array` types filter out `Undefined` values, if you have an array type with a constructor type as its member, the constructor now can return `Dry::Types::Undefined` to indicate empty value:\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  filter_empty_strings = Types::Strict::Array.of(\r\n    Types::Strict::String.constructor { |input|\r\n      input.to_s.yield_self { |s| s.empty? ? Dry::Types::Undefined : s }\r\n    }\r\n  )\r\n  filter_empty_strings.([\"John\", nil, \"\", \"Jane\"]) # => [\"John\", \"Jane\"]\r\n  ```\r\n* `Types::Map` was added for homogeneous hashes, when only types of keys and values are known in advance, not specific key names (fledman + flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n    int_to_string = Types::Hash.map('strict.integer', 'strict.string')\r\n    int_to_string[0 => 'foo'] # => { 0 => \"foo\" }\r\n    int_to_string[0 => 1] # Dry::Types::MapError: input value 1 for key 0 is invalid: type?(String, 1)\r\n  ```\r\n* Enum supports mappings (bolshakov + flash-gordon)\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  dict = Types::Strict::String.enum('draft' => 0, 'published' => 10, 'archived' => 20)\r\n  dict['published'] # => 'published'\r\n  dict[10] # => 'published'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n* Fixed applying constraints to optional type, i.e. `.optional.constrained` works correctly (flash-gordon)\r\n* Fixed enum working with optionals (flash-gordon)\r\n\r\n## Internal\r\n\r\n* Dropped the `dry-configurable` dependency (GustavoCaso)\r\n* The gem now uses `dry-inflector` for inflections instead of `inflecto` (GustavoCaso)\r\n\r\n[Compare v0.12.2...v0.13.0](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-types/compare/v0.12.2...v0.13.0)"}
