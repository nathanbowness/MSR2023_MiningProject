dataset: databases for lazy people
==================================

![build](https://github.com/pudo/dataset/workflows/build/badge.svg)

In short, **dataset** makes reading and writing data in databases as simple as reading and writing JSON files.

[Read the docs](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/)

To install dataset, fetch it with ``pip``:

```bash
$ pip install dataset
```

**Note:** as of version 1.0, **dataset** is split into two packages, with the
data export features now extracted into a stand-alone package, **datafreeze**.
See the relevant repository [here](https://github.com/pudo/datafreeze).
