A shim header is proposed to facilitate the data streaming\r\n  directly from the publishing process on network processor of line\r\n  cards to receivers. The objective is a lightweight approach to\r\n  enable higher frequency and less performance impact on publisher\r\n  and receiver process compared to already established notification\r\n  mechanisms. Many thanks to Alex Huang Feng ( @ahuangfeng ) and the\r\n  whole Unyte team.\r\n+ BGP, BMP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: now correctly honouring the\r\n  supplied Kafka partition key for BGP, BMP and Telemetry msg logs\r\n  and dump events.\r\n+ BGP, BMP daemons: a new \"rd_origin\" field is added to output log/\r\n  dump to specify the source of Route Distinguisher information (ie.\r\n  flow vs BGP vs BMP).\r\n+ pre_tag_map: added ability to tag new NetFlow/IPFIX and sFlow\r\n  sample_type types: \"flow-ipv4\", \"flow-ipv6\", \"flow-mpls-ipv4\" and\r\n  \"flow-mpls-ipv6\". Also added a new \"is_bi_flow\" true/false key to\r\n  tag (or exclude) NSEL bidirectional flows. Added as well a new\r\n  \"is_multicast\" true/false config key to tag (or exclude) IPv4/IPv6\r\n  multicast destinations.\r\n+ maps_index: enables indexing of maps to increase lookup speeds on\r\n  large maps and/or sustained lookup rates. The feature has been\r\n  remplemented using stream-lined structures from libcdada. This is\r\n  a major work that helps preventing the unpredictable behaviours\r\n  caused by the homegrown map indexing mechanism. Many thanks to\r\n  Marc Sune ( @msune ).\r\n+ maps_index: support for indexing src_net and dst_net keywords has\r\n  been added.\r\n+ Added <daemon_name>_ipv6_only config directives to optionally\r\n  enable the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option. Also changed the wrong\r\n  setsockopt() IPV6_BINDV6ONLY id to IPV6_V6ONLY.\r\n+ Added log function to libserdes to debug transactions with the\r\n  Schema Registry when kafka_avro_schema_registry is set.\r\n+ nDPI: newer versions of the library (ie. >= 3.5) bring changes\r\n  to the API. pmacct is now aligned to compile against these.\r\n+ pmacctd: added pcap_arista_trailer_offset config directive since\r\n  Arista has changed the structure of the trailer format in recent\r\n  releases of EOS. Thanks to Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic )\r\n  for his patch.\r\n+ More improvements carried out on the Continuous Integration\r\n  (CI) side by migrating from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. Huge\r\n  thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) to make all of this possible.\r\n+ More improvements also carried out in the space of the Docker\r\n  images being created: optimized image size and a better layered\r\n  pipeline. Thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) and Daniel Caballero\r\n  ( @dcaba ) to make all of this possible.\r\n+ libcdada shipped with pmacct was upgraded to version 0.3.5. Many\r\n  thanks Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his work with libcdada.\r\n! build system: several improvements carried out in this area,\r\n  ie. improved MySQL checks, introduced pcap-config tool for\r\n  libpcap, compiling on BSD/old compilers, etc. Monumental thanks\r\n  to Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his continued help.\r\n! fix, nfacctd: improved euristics to support the case of flows\r\n  with both IPv4 and IPv6 source / destination addresses (either\r\n  or populated). Also improved euristics to distinguish event data\r\n  vs traffic data in NetFlow v9/IPFIX from Cisco 9300/9500, ASA\r\n  firewalls and Cisco 4500X.\r\n! fix, nfacctd: improved support for initiatorOctets (IE #231) and\r\n  responderOctets (IE #232). Thanks to Esben Laursen ( @hyberdk )\r\n  for reporting the issue.\r\n! fix, nfacctd: in NF_mpls_vpn_id_handler() double ntohl() calls\r\n  were applied for the case of 'vrfid'-encoded mpls_vpn_rd field.\r\n! fix, sfacctd: wrong ethertype set for VLAN-tagged, MPLS-labelled\r\n  IPv6 traffic. Impacting BGP resolution among others. Thanks to\r\n  Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic ) for his help resolving the\r\n  problem.\r\n! fix, BGP, BMP daemons: parsing improvements: added a check for\r\n  BGP Open message and BGP Open Options lengths. Strengthened\r\n  parsing of Peer Up, Route Monitoring and Peer Down v4 messages.\r\n! fix, BGP, BMP daemon: when using Avro encoding and Avro Schema\r\n  Registry, attempt to reconnect if serdes schemas are voided.\r\n  Also now checking for serdes schema definitions before doing a\r\n  serdes_schema_serialize_avro() to avoid triggering a SEGV.\r\n  Finally improved serdes logging.\r\n! fix, BGP, Streaming Telemetry daemons: in daemon logs, summary\r\n  counters for amount of tables / entries dumped were wrong.\r\n! fix, BGP daemon: distinguish among null and zero value AIGP\r\n  and Prefix SID attributes. Same applies for Local Preference\r\n  and MED attributes.\r\n! fix, BMP daemon: resolved a memory leak in bgp_peers_free().\r\n  Thanks to Pether Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for his patch. Also\r\n  resolved a leak caused by an invalid BGP message contained in a\r\n  BMP Route Message v4.\r\n! fix, BMP daemon: correctly setting peer_ip and peer_tcp_port\r\n  JSON fields for Term messages. Also the correct bmp_router\r\n  value when bmp_daemon_parse_proxy_header feature is enabled.\r\n! fix, BMP daemon: several encoding issues when using Apache Avro\r\n  ie. u_int64_t now correctly encoded with avro_value_set_long(),\r\n  certain u_int32_t fields switched to avro_value_set_long() due\r\n  to lack of unsignedness in Avro encoding, improved various\r\n  aspectes of Avro-JSON format output, etc.\r\n! fix, pmtelemetryd: wrong parsing of pm_tfind() output was\r\n  leading to mistaken data attribution of UDP-based peers (always\r\n  first peer to connect was being picked).\r\n! fix, pmtelemetryd: when set, the pidfile config directive was\r\n  not being correctly honoured.\r\n! fix, RPKI: the RTR PDU element for maxLength is uint8, therefore\r\n  it might have been possible to transmit incorrect RTR data.\r\n  Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his patch. \r\n! fix, SQL plugins: amended the text composition of SQL queries\r\n  that are involving latitude and longitude keys.\r\n! fix, MySQL plugin: check for 'unix:' prefix string only when a\r\n  sql_host configuration directive is specified.\r\n! fix, nfprobe: modernized Application Information export. Until\r\n  the previous release pmacct was adhering to aging NBAR model\r\n  whereas now NBAR2 has been implemented. Thanks to Rob Cowart\r\n  ( @robcowart ) for helping out resolving this issue.\r\n! fix, tee plugin: restored usefulness of tee_source_ip which was\r\n  broken in 1.7.6. Thanks to Jeremiah Millay ( @floatingstatic )\r\n  for reporting the issue.\r\n! fix, maps_index: indexing of mpls_pw_id was broken. Also now,\r\n  when the feature is enabled, actual data is being referenced in\r\n  the index structure instead of creating a copy of it; thanks to\r\n  Sander van Delden ( @SanderDelden ) for reporting the memory\r\n  leak that was resulting from the copy.\r\n! fix, kafka_common.c: solved memory leak in p_kafka_set_topic()\r\n  when Kafka session was getting in down state. Many thanks to\r\n  Peter Pothier ( @pothier-peter ) for nailing the issue.\r\n! fix, net_aggr.[ch]: when a networks_file is specified in the\r\n  config, gracefully handle max memory structure depth; added\r\n  also de-duplication of entries.\r\n! fix, pmacct-defines.h: if PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN is not defined,\r\n  ie. in libpcap < 1.1.0, let's define it.\r\n! fix, SO_REUSEPORT feature was being restricted to Linux only in\r\n  previous releases: now it has been unlocked to all other OS that\r\n  do support the feature.\r\n! fix, split SO_REUSEPORT and SO_REUSEADDR setsockopt() calls.\r\n  Thanks to @eduarrrd for reporting and resolving the issue.\r\n! fix, several code warnings catched gcc9 and clang.\r\n- Obsoleted sql_history_since_epoch, pre_tag_map_entries and\r\n  refresh_maps configuration directives.", "mentions_count": 10}

All new structures\r\n   will make use of libcdada, old ones will be ported over time.\r\n   Libcdada offers basic data structures in C: ie. list, set, map/\r\n   hash table, queue and is a libstdc++ wrapper. Many thanks to\r\n   Marc Sune ( @msune ) for his work with libcdada and his enormous\r\n   help facilitating the integration.\r\n* BGP daemon: added suppport for Accumulated IGP Metric Attribute\r\n   (AIGP) and Label-Index TLV of Prefix-SID Attribute.\r\n* BGP daemon: added SO_KEEPALIVE TCP socket option (ie. to keep the\r\n   sessions alive via a firewall / NAT kind of device). Thanks to\r\n   Jared Mauch ( @jaredmauch ) for his patch.\r\n* BGP daemon: if comparing source TCP ports among BGP peers is\r\n   being enabled (config directive tmp_bgp_lookup_compare_ports),\r\n   print also BGP Router-ID as distinguisher as part of log/dump\r\n   output.\r\n* BMP daemon: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol Header in\r\n   the first BMP message in order to determine the original sender\r\n   IP address and port. The new bmp_daemon_parse_proxy_header config\r\n   directive enables the feature. Contribution is by Peter Pothier\r\n   ( @pothier-peter ).\r\n* BMP daemon: improved support and brought implementation on par\r\n   with the latest drafting efforts at IETF wrt draft-cppy-grow-bmp-\r\n   path-marking-tlv, draft-xu-grow-bmp-route-policy-attr-trace,\r\n   draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv and draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit.\r\n* BMP daemon: added 'bgp_agent_map' equivalent feature for BMP.\r\n* nfacctd, nfprobe plugin: added support for collection and export\r\n   of NetFlow/IPFIX data over Datagram Transport Layer Security (in\r\n   short DTLS). The feature depends on the GnuTLS library.\r\n* nfacctd: added support for deprecated NetFlow v9 IE #104\r\n   (layer2packetSectionData) as it is implemented for NetFlow-lite\r\n   on Cisco devices. Reused code from IPFIX IE #315.\r\n* nfacctd: added support for MPLS VPN RD IE #90. This comes in two\r\n   flavours both found across vendor implementations: 1) IE present\r\n   in flow data and 2) IE present in Options data as a lookup from\r\n   IE #234 (ingressVRFID) and #235 (egressVRFID).\r\n* nfacctd: added a new timestamp_export aggregation primitive to\r\n   record the timestamp being carried in the header of NetFlow/IPFIX\r\n   messates (that is, the time at which the export was performed).\r\n* nfprobe plugin: added support for ICMP/ICMPv6 information as part\r\n   of the NetFlow/IPFIX export. The piece of info is encoded in the\r\n   destination port field as per the current common understandings\r\n   across vendors. As a result of that, the 'dst_port' primitive is\r\n   to be part of the aggregation method in order to leverage this\r\n   feature.\r\n* MySQL plugin: introduced support to connect to a MySQL server\r\n   via UNIX sockets.\r\n* tee plugin: added crc32 hash algorithm as a new balancing option\r\n   for nodes in the receiving pool. It hashes original exporter IP\r\n   address against a crc32 function. Thanks to @edge-intelligence\r\n   for the contribution.\r\n* Massive improvements carried out on the Continuous Integration\r\n   (CI) side, ie. to ensure better quality of the code, and on the\r\n   containerization side by offering official stable / bleeding edge\r\n   Docker images. Huge thanks to Marc Sune ( @msune ) to make all of\r\n   this possible."}

Also added support for Peer\r\n  Distinguisher field in the BMP Per-Peer Header.\r\n* BMP daemon: added support for reading from savefiles in libpcap\r\n  format (pcap_savefile, pcap_savefile_delay, pcap_savefile_replay,\r\n  pcap_filter) as an alternative to the use of bmp_play.py.\r\n* BMP daemon: re-worked, improved and generalized support for TLVs\r\n  at the end of BMP messages. In this context, unknown Stats data\r\n  is handled as a generic TLV. \r\n* BMP daemon: added SO_KEEPALIVE TCP socket option (ie. to keep the\r\n  sessions alive via a firewall / NAT kind of device). Thanks to\r\n  Jared Mauch ( @jaredmauch ) for his patch. \r\n* nfacctd, nfprobe plugin: added usec timestamp resolution to IPFIX\r\n  collector and export via IEs #154, #155.

If nfacctd_templates_receiver points to\r\n  a replicator and the replicator exports to nfacctd_templates_port\r\n  of a set of collectors then, for example, it gets possible to share\r\n  templates among collectors in a cluster for the purpose of seamless\r\n  scale-out.\r\n* pmtelemetryd: in addition to existing TCP, UDP and ZeroMQ inputs,\r\n  the daemon can now read Streaming Telemetry data in JSON format\r\n  from a Kafka broker (telemetry_daemon_kafka_* config knobs).\r\n* pmgrpcd.py: Use of multiple processes for the Kafka Avro exporter\r\n  to leverage the potential of multi-core/processors architectures.\r\n  Code is from Raphael P. Barazzutti ( @rbarazzutti ).\r\n* pmgrpcd.py: added -F / --no-flatten command-line option to disable\r\n  object flattening (default true for backward compatibility); also\r\n  export to a Kafka broker for (flattened) JSON objects was added (in\r\n  addition to existing export to ZeroMQ).\r\n* nDPI: introduced support for nDPI 3.2 and dropped support for all\r\n  earlier versions of the library due to changes to the API.\r\n* Docker: embraced the technology for CI purposes; added a docker/\r\n  directory in the file distribution where Dockerfile and scripts to\r\n  build pmacct and dependencies are shared.

It supports gRPC\r\n    transport along with Protobuf encoding as input and can output to\r\n    Kafka with Avro encoding. Output to files and JSON encoding is\r\n    currently supported sending data via ZMQ to pmtelemetryd first. It\r\n    was tested working with data input from Cisco and Huawei routers\r\n    and v3 replaces v2. Thanks to the Streaming Telemetry core team:\r\n    Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ), Camilo Cardona ( @jccardonar ),\r\n    Thomas Graf ( @graf3 , @graf3net ), Paolo Lucente ( @paololucente ).\r\n  + Introduced support for the 'vxlan' VXLAN/VNI primitive in all traffic\r\n    daemons (NetFlow/IPFIX, sFlow and libpcap/ULOG). Existing inner tunnel\r\n    primitives (ie. tunnel_src_host, tunnel_dst_host, tunnel_proto, etc.)\r\n    have been wired to the VXLAN decoding and new ones (tunnel_src_mac, \r\n    tunnel_dst_mac, tunnel_src_port, tunnel_dst_port) were defined.\r\n  + BMP daemon: added support for Peer Up message namespace for TLVs\r\n    (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up) and also support for Route Monitor\r\n    and Peer Down TLVs (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv).\r\n  + BGP, BMP daemons: in addition to existing JSON export, data can now\r\n    be exported in Apache Avro format. There is also support for the\r\n    Confluent Schema Registry.\r\n  + Introduced support for JSON-encoded Apache Avro encoding. While the\r\n    binary-encoded Apache Avro is always recommended for any production\r\n    scenarios (also to optionallly leverage Confluent Schema Registry\r\n    support), JSON-encoded is powerful for testing and troubleshooting\r\n    scenarios.\r\n  + sfprobe plugin: added support for IPv6 transport for sFlow export.\r\n    sfprobe_agentip is an IP address put in the header of the sFlow\r\n    packet. If underlying transport is IPv6, this must be configured to\r\n    an IPv6 address.\r\n  + zmq_common.[ch]: Improved modularity of the ZMQ internal API and\r\n    decoupled bind/connect from push/pull and pub/sub; also improved\r\n    support for inproc sockets. All to increase the amount of use-cases\r\n    covered by the API.\r\n  + bgp_peer_src_as_map: added 'filter' key to cover pmacctd/uacctd use\r\n    cases.\r\n  + nfprobe, sfprobe plugins: introduced [sn]fprobe_index_override to\r\n    override ifindexes dynamically determined (ie. by NFLOG) with values\r\n    computed by [sn]fprobe_ifindex.\r\n  + MySQL, PostgreSQL plugins: added support for SSL/TLS connections by\r\n    specifying a CA certificate (sql_conn_ca_file).\r\n  + Kafka, AMQP plugins: amqp_markers and kafka_markers have now been\r\n    properly re-implemented when output encoding is Avro using an own\r\n    Avro schema (instead of squatting pieces of JSON in the data stream\r\n    for the very purpose).\r\n  + print plugin: introduced print_write_empty_file config knob (true,\r\n    false) to create an empty output file when there are no cache entries\r\n    to purge. Such behaviour was present in versions up to 0.14 and may\r\n    be preferred by some to the new >= 1.5 versions behaviour. Thanks to\r\n    Lee Yongjae ( @setup74 ) for the contribution."}

Resource Public Key Infrastructure\r\n  (RPKI) is a specialized public key infrastructure (PKI) framework\r\n  designed to secure the Internet routing. RPKI uses certificates to\r\n  allow Local Internet Registries (LIRs) to list the Internet number\r\n  resources they hold. These attestations are called Route Origination\r\n  Authorizations (ROAs). ROA information can be acquired in one of the\r\n  two following ways: 1) importing it using the rpki_roas_file config\r\n  directive from a file in the RIPE Validator format or 2) connecting\r\n  to a RPKI RTR Cache for live ROA updates; the cache IP address/port\r\n  being defined by the rpki_rtr_cache config directive (and a few more\r\n  optional rpki_rtr_* directives are available and can be reviwed in\r\n  the CONFIG-KEYS doc). The ROA fields will be populated with one of\r\n  these five values: 'u' Unknown, 'v' Valid, 'i' Invalid no overlaps,\r\n  'V' Invalid with a covering Valid prefix, 'U' Invalid with a covering\r\n  Unknown prefix. Thanks to Job Snijders ( @job ) for his support and\r\n  vision.\r\n+ Introducing pmgrpcd.py, written in Python, a daemon to handle gRPC-\r\n  based Streaming Telemetry sessions and unmarshall GPB data. Code\r\n  was mostly courtesy by Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ). This is in\r\n  addition (or feeding into) pmtelemetryd, written in C, a daemon to\r\n  handle TCP/UDP-based Streaming Telemetry sessions with JSON-encoded\r\n  data. Thanks to Matthias Arnold ( @tbearma1 ) and Thomas Graf for\r\n  their support and contributing code.\r\n+ pmacctd, uacctd: added support for CFP (Cisco FabricPath) and Cisco\r\n  Virtual Network Tag protocols. Both patches were courtesy by Stephen\r\n  Clark ( @sclark46 ). \r\n+ print plugin: added 'custom' to print_output. This is to cover two\r\n  main use-cases: 1) use JSON or Avro encodings but fix the format of\r\n  the messages in a custom way and 2) use a different encoding than\r\n  JSON or Avro. See also example in examples/custom and new directives\r\n  print_output_custom_lib and print_output_custom_cfg_file. The patch\r\n  was courtesy by Edge Intelligence ( @edge-intelligence ).\r\n+ Introducing mpls_pw_id aggregation primitive and mpls_pw_id key in\r\n  pre_tag_map to filter on signalled L2 MPLS VPN Pseudowire IDs.\r\n+ BGP daemon: added bgp_disable_router_id knob to enable/disable BGP\r\n  Router-ID check, both at BGP OPEN time and BGP lookup. Useful, for\r\n  example, in scenarios with split BGP v4/v6 AFs over v4/v6 transports.\r\n+ BGP, BMP daemons: translate origin attribute numeric value into IGP\r\n  (i), EGP (e) and Incomplete (u) strings.\r\n+ plugins: added new plugin_exit_any feature to make the daemon bail\r\n  out if any (not all, which is the default behaviour) of the plugins\r\n  exits.\r\n+ maps_index: improved selection of buckets for index hash structure\r\n  by picking the closest prime number to the double of the entries of\r\n  the map to be indexed in order to achieve better elements dispersion\r\n  and hence better performances.\r\n+ nfacctd: added support for IPFIX templateId-scoped (IE 145) sampling\r\n  information.\r\n+ pmacctd, uacctd, sfacctd, nfacctd: added a -M command-line option to\r\n  set *_markers (ie. print_markers) to true and fixed -A command-line\r\n  option to set print_output_file_append to align to true/false.\r\n- Read ChangeLog for full list of fixes."}
