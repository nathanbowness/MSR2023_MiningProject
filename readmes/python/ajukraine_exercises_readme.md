# SoftwarePark Exercises

SoftwarePark exercises and dojos:

- [Transport Tycoon and DDD/ES](transport-tycoon.md)

You can subscribe to the [mailing list](https://tinyletter.com/softwarepark) for the new exercises or just keep an eye on this repository. Updates are planned **once per week, at most**.

## Reason

Domain-Driven Design (and the attention to the software design in general) is one of the essential things that make up the *ethos of SoftwarePark*. 

We want to **spread the DDD ideas, experience and insights within the company**. To help with that, we are starting a short series of exercises, accompanied with a mini podcast. 

While doing that we will keep exercises public and transparent. Perhaps, somebody else would find them helpful or entertaining.
