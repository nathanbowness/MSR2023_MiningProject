## What this plugin does
Usually all players must sleep before a night/storm can be skipped on a multiplayer server.
BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Quite extensive configuration is included to suit your needs. The configuration includes, but is not limited to:
 - Set the night skip mode: will **time pass faster** or will it be set to day?
 - Set a **percentage** of players that must sleep to skip the night, or choose to set a **static amount** that must sleep
 - All messages can be **customised** in lang.yml, and by default several languages are supported (English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, ...). [Full list here](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/tree/v3.0.0/src/main/resources/lang)
 - Give players **buffs** (potion effects) for sleeping or **debuffs** for not sleeping!
 - **Disable phantoms**
 - Display **messages on screen** instead of in the chat
 - ... And **so much more**! Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/wiki) to see all options. 

## Tested Spigot versions
This plugin is functional and has been tested on several Spigot versions. Bukkit should be compatible too but no extensive testing has been done. 
You can see the **latest** and **tested** BetterSleeping version for every supported Spigot version in the table below. 
Newer updates than the mentioned BetterSleeping versions will probably be fully compatible but have not been tested (yet). 
Previous versions of BetterSleeping can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/releases).
