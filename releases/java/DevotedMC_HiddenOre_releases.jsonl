Standard config is used as default for any world that does not have a specific config. A new section, `worlds` can be specified, each subsection is either the UUID or name of the world with a specific config. A single `blocks` subsection under the world identifier contains all the block configurations for that world. It is configured like the default, but within the world's blocks subsection. Check the configs for examples.\r\n\r\n**v1.4.1** Live use of new tracker shows its disk use is much increased. Added a configuration option to explicitly disable it. Added config example of Command \"drops\" and some fixes.\r\n\r\n**v1.4.0** New exploit tracker that tracks the actual blocks broken or exposed. This will fully prevent the \"but I already checked that block\" problem. Heuristic tracking is, for now, still active.\r\n\r\n**v1.3.2** You can now run a command on block break. If you use reward crates, could gift, or custom /give, etc -- runs as SERVER so be careful. Use %player% to inject the player name into the command, or %uuid% to inject the player's Minecraft UUID.\r\n\r\n**v1.3.1** Added a command for OPs only that generates all the drops configured. It has some quirks, but type /hiddenore generate to spawn the items.\r\n\r\n**v1.2.9** Support for dusting the caves in your map with ore based on your active config; kind of an addendum to v1.2.7's feature. Can be used to prevent the \"boring caves\" problem when a world is otherwise devoid of ore from the 1.2.7 feature. Don't use your final config, do use a Generate only config, and do turn off drops if generate fails.\r\n\r\n**v1.2.8** Support for altering drop chance based on 6 basic player effect states, generated by potion or beacon. Configurable by drop and biome (biome acts as override)\r\n\r\n**v1.2.7** Experimental feature to allow stripping a world of ores during the generation phase. Fully configurable per-world by name; you can set it to replace any set of materials with a single material. Also includes a new anti-bypass method to directly target that \"initial return\" that can still occur from generators and place-break-place-break cycles"}
