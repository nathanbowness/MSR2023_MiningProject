1.13 and 1.13.1 support.\r\n* WorldGuard 7 support.\r\n* WorldEdit 7 support.\r\n* Update all translations (pulled from Transifex).\r\n* Add import for RegionForSale regions:\r\n    * `/as import RegionForSale`\r\n    * Imports all regions from RegionForSale\r\n    * Converts almost all settings to their AreaShop equivalent\r\n    * Handles parent regions\r\n* Add setting to automatically extends a rent when the time is up: `rent.autoExtend` in `default.yml`.\r\n* Added options to disable players selling/reselling regions: `buy.sellDisabled`, `buy.resellDisabled`.\r\n* Add setting to disable cross-world teleports for the `/as tp` command: `teleportCrossWorld` in the `general` section of `default.yml`.\r\n* Add setting to disable cross-world teleports for the `/as find` command: `findCrossWorld` in the `general` section of `default.yml`.\r\n* Allow `price` and `moneyBack` values to be calculated dynamically:\r\n  * All region variables can be used: `price: \"5*%volume%\"` would be `$5` per cubic meter (block in the region).\r\n  * Full JavaScript expressions and code can be used, the last statement will be the resulting price.\r\n* Add `%volume%` variable for the number of blocks in a region, which supports polygon regions correctly.\r\n* `/as stack` now allows the usage of `#` to choose the position of the number in the region name.\r\n* Add customizable metric suffixes, now you can decide when to shorten a number and how, see `metricSymbols` in `config.yml`.\r\n* Add support for automatically adding all AreaShop regions of a certain world to a RegionGroup\r\n\r\n**Technical:**\r\n* BREAKING: `BuyingRegionEvent`, `RentingRegionEvent` and `ResellingRegionEvent` now use `OfflinePlayer` instead of `Player`, because renting/buying/reselling is now also possible while the player is offline.\r\n* Improved file loading mechanics\r\n* Improve sign update performance, AreaShop will never load chunks anymore, and will simply update signs when players load chunks.\r\n* Moved the messaging library to its own project: [InteractiveMessenger](https://github.com/NLthijs48/InteractiveMessenger)\r\n  * Added a lot of automated tests to ensure all functionality keeps working\r\n  * Fixed bugs with formatting codes, line endings and hover messages\r\n  * All user input that is inserted into messages is now escaped properly (using variables does not break the message anyore)\r\n* Add [bStats.org](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/AreaShop) analytics. Since mcstats.org is really unstable and offline half of the time I added bStats (which tracks the same information, plus the number of regions and their state), MCStats tracking will be removed in a future version.\r\n* Groups are never removed from `groups.yml` anymore, previously they were removed when they had zero regions, which wipe settings.\r\n* Github update checker has been added as replacement for the BukkitDev updater (it will never download anything, it just notifies about updates).\r\n* Only update WorldGuard region settings if they are different, this should prevent unnecessary saving by WorldGuard.\r\n* When new code is pushed to Github the translations on Transifex get updated automatically, so that translations can begin immediately.\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n* Security issues caused by saving/restoring entities in schematics\r\n* Prevent missing `schematicProfile` causing an exception.\r\n* Setting `schematicProfile` in a region file.\r\n* Players could resell their region with a negative price.\r\n* Using `landlordName` without `landlord` (UUID) setting works correctly now.\r\n* Using `/as addfriend` with a player that is online for the first time.\r\n* Removing the English time modifiers from the config.yml file would cause all tasks to be broken, because their schedule time is defined with strings like `1 minute`. The English modifiers from the config.yml inside the .jar file are always added now.\r\n* `/as setowner` for regions that are not yet rented has been fixed.\r\n* Restoring polygon regions will now only touch blocks that are actually inside the region."}

The problem AreaShop v2.3.2 has is that it fails to read the WorldGuard version, which was already fixed in the [development builds](http://wiefferink.me:8080/job/AreaShop/) shortly after the v2.3.2 release._\n"}

Can be turned off in the `default.yml` file with `extendToFullWhenAboveMaxRentTime`.\n- Add event system:\n  - 'ask' type events that can be cancelled, broadcasted before the action happens.\n  - 'notify' type events that cannot be cancelled, but only let you know that it has happened.\n  - Events for renting (with extending flag), unrenting, buying, selling, reselling, adding and removing.\n  - General 'RegionUpdateEvent' to listen to as display service (update signs, update regions flags, etc).\n  - Can be used to write addons for AreaShop.\n  - Is currently only used for updating signs and regions, but other parts of AreaShop will also be using it soon.\n- Add `areashop.linksigns` permissions to the `areashop.*` permissions group.\n- Add priority, interact and build flag to the default `config.yml` file, helps to reduce support for issues with this.\n- Add `middle` and number options to the `teleportLocationY` setting in `default.yml`.\n- Add variable support for all language messages that can support it, which means where a region is known.\n- Add Czech language, translated by Fractival.\n\n**Fixes:**\n- Fix last active time of players sometimes not updating correctly, influences inactive unrent/sell feature.\n- Fix message variables for `/as info player <player>`.\n- Fix the `n:<name>` option for member/owner region flags (the `n:` was not stripped away before adding them).\n"}

Setting `allowRegionExtendsWhenAboveLimits` can be found in `config.yml` and is by default set at `false`, this modifies the behaviour of AreaShop compared to the previous version, but this is probably something that users already expect to happen.\n- Fixed a bug with `/as tp` sometimes teleporting to the region instead of a the sign when a player has certain permissions.\n- Moved all documentation to GitHub, as you probably have already seen.\n- Added permission `areashop.buyresell` and `areashop.buynormal` to be able to prevent players from buying regions that are in reselling mode, or regions that are not in reselling mode.\n- Fixed `/as find` without balance argument using a maximum of zero instead of the balance of the player + formatting of the price will now use the proper currency formatting instead of a plain number.\n- Fixed `/as info` trying to filter by group for a couple of sub commands when it should not.\n- Fixed `/as info region <region>` always showing a line specifying the landlord, even when there is not one (it would show `<UNKNOWN>`).\n- Added Vault jar file to the repository to make compiling easier, only cloning + running with Maven is enough now.\n- Improved handling of failed file loading for all config and region files, better messages in console for when it happens.\n- Remove `lastActive` line from region files when unrented/sold, nothing serious, just cleanup.\n- Fixed sign click actions still executing even when the Bukkit event is cancelled.\n- Breaking signs that are connected to regions will not longer disconnect it, but instead make it float.\n- Made removing regions from AreaShop less destructible for region flags, only greeting and farewell are removed to avoid confusion (this helps when you accidentally add wrong regions).\n- Fixed support for the seconds modifiers when using `/as setduration`.\n- Added support for weeks modifiers for specifying time durations.\n- Cleaned old Dutch time modifiers from `config.yml`, **Warning: This will break existing signs with these modifiers if not re-added in the config**. Regions using incorrect time specifiers will be listed in the console/log at startup.\n- Unrenting/selling a region that has a landlord will now get the money from the landlord instead of introducing new money. If the landlord does not have enough money then the user will get nothing back.\n- Change the default sign tags to `[asrent]` and `[asbuy]`, this prevents clashes with for example Essentials. This will not impact already linked signs, only creating new signs and the tags can still be easily changed in the config.\n"}

If the world or WorldGuard region is missing that is required for the functions of the region then it will simply say so in the console. This will make sure that regions are not removed when you have trouble loading your world or your WorldGuard regions.\n- Make the update checker async, also when it cannot reach BukkitDev to check for updates it does not slow down the start of the server.\n- Fix `/as setowner` not saving the region file, and therefore losing changes when restarting the server.\n- Change Vault integration to support custom (not build into Vault) economies. This also enables support to change economies while the server is running.\n- Fix a bug with teleporting to regions, and add a message when the teleport changes from sign to region or the other way around (this happens when the user does not have permission for one of them, but has for the other).\n- Remove the `enableSchematics` setting from the config file, this setting is already in default.yml and only caused confusion.\n- Added landlord functionality:\n  - Set the landlord of a region with `/as setlandlord <player>`.\n  - Set the landlord in default.yml or groups by UUID or name.\n  - All revenue of a region (buy/rental) will go to the landlord.\n  - Permissions `areashop.createrent.owner`, `areashop.createrent.member`, `areashop.createbuy.owner` and `areashop.createbuy.member` to enable users to add existing WorldGuard regions to AreaShop if they are already owner/member (they are automatically assigned as landlord when they add regions).\n  - Permissions `areashop.destroybuy.landlord` and `areashop.destroyrent.landlord` to give landlords the permission to remove their region from AreaShop.\n  - Permission `areashop.setprice.landlord` to let landlords change the price of their region.\n  - Permission `areashop.setduration.landlord` to let landlords change the duration of their region.\n  - Permission `areashop.landlord.*` to give all landlord permissions to a player (all permissions above).\n- Added arguments `default` and `reset` to `/as setprice` and `/as setduration` to remove the setting from the region file (then it inherits it again from the groups or default.yml).\n- Support Metric prefixes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) to display large numbers nicely. This means you can display numbers like `1000000` as `1.00G` instead. Has options to indicate from which number prefixes should be used.\n- Added a decimalMark setting to config.yml to change the character used to indicate the fractional part of numbers (change from dot to comma for example).\n- Changed all time period settings in config files to a readable format like the rental times. Old values will still be read correctly, and should work exactly like in the old version.\n- Make sure regions are not unnecessary saved directly after loading them at server startup.\n- Fixed an issue with `/as addfriend` denying you to add players that just joined for the first time.\n- Fix a problem with depositing money to players that never joined the server (or for which there is no player.dat file anymore).\n- Add date and time variables for all config settings (can be used to save schematics as backup, creating a new one each time instead of overwriting).\n- Add fallback system for owners and landlords, if the UUID has no correct name within the Bukkit API it will use the cached name.

Regular expressions make it possible to for example block all regions with a certain pattern.\n- Added a setting `findTeleportToSign` to change if `/as find` should teleport you to the first sign of the region or to the `/as settp` spot (with fallback to the middle of the region).\n- Fixed a small bug that would cause you to get teleported to the fallback spot instead of the `/as settp` one when you try to teleport to a sign but don't have permission for it (AreaShop changes your request to a non-sign teleport if you do have permission for that in that case)\n- Added an extra option to `/as info` to list all regions that do not have a group, use `/as info nogroup`.\n- Added name change detection on login of the player (checks if the players name matches the saved name for the regions that are owned by the players, works because getting regions happens with the UUID) and if it changed it will update the region flags and signs.\n- Changed that now all region flags and signs will be updated when starting the server, that way users don't think that something does not work simply because the region is not updated. This can be turned off by setting `updateRegionsOnStartup` to false in the config (updating the region happens slowly so it should not cause any noticeable lag).\n- Removed the `/as updaterents` and `/as updatebuys` commands, became redundant because `/as reload` also updates all regions now so that can be used instead.\n- Fixed translation of color codes for greeting/farewell messages for WorldGuard 6.0+ users (this problem was caused by an unintended breaking change by WorldGuard, check [this ticket](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/regionbuyandrent/tickets/26-color-issue/) for details).\n"}

Also notifies OPs + players with the `areashop.notifyupdate` permission. It will never download the latest version, because those might require a backup or manual changes to run properly.\n- Fixed some possible bugs with getting the list of players that are added as friend to a region.\n- --Restored compatibility with WorldGuard 5.9 (WorldGuard 6.0+ is still recommended because that one properly supports UUID's, so 5.9 would cause problems with name changing) and WorldEdit 5.6.3 (could probably already be used with previous AreaShop versions)-- Broken in this version, fixed in V2.1.3 by releasing 2 jar files.\n- The French language file has been corrected at some points.\n- The German language file has been completed and corrected at some points\n- The Polish language file has been improved slightly, but is not 100% complete yet (can you help translating?

By default friends can also teleport to the regions they are added to, deny permission `areashop.teleportfriend` to stop this.\n- Automatic unrenting for players that are inactive for a certain period of time (`inactiveTimeUntilUnrent` and `inactiveTimeUntilSell` in default.yml, so this can also be changed for groups of regions or individual ones) OPs are excluded by default, those regions will not be unrented/sold.\n- Added a argument to `/as find` to specify a group, it will only search for regions in that group if specified. Could be useful to create command signs and let players automatically get a region that is at a certain place.\n- Added a command `/as me`, which lists all your rent and buy regions, plus regions you are added as friend.\n- Added a `/as setowner <player> [region]` command to change the owner of a region without triggering events for commands, schematics or money transactions (using this command on a rent region with the player that already rents it will extend the region by 1 time period).\n- Added a `/as resell <price> [region]` command to let players put their bought region into resell mode. If they do that the sign will indicate you can buy the region (shows [Resale] at the top), but the owner can still do anything like normal. When another player buys the region then the money will get transferred to the original owner and the new player will be owner (then the sign shows [Sold] again). If a player changed his mind and does not want to resell his region anymore he can use `/as resell`.\n- Added a tag `%timeleft%` for signs to show the time that a rent has left instead of the end date, AreaShop will update signs that have this every minute by default (check the values in the `signs` section at the bottom of the config to change this)\n- All files (config.yml, default.yml, groups.yml, <region>.yml and <lang>.yml) are now loaded in UTF-8 mode, so now they support all fancy characters like \u20ac or \u00ea.\n- Limitgroups for limiting how much regions a player can buy/rent have changed to be more flexible. Now a `worlds` and `groups` section can be added to a group to let the limits only count for regions in these worlds and groups. This allows for different limits for regions in different world (let players have max 2 plots in creative, while limiting the number of shops in survival to 1) the groups allow you to limit certain type of regions that are in the same world.\n- The limitgroup `unlimited` that was normally in the config by default has been removed and now the permission `areashop.limitbypass` allows you to ignore the limits (default to OPs)\n- The `areashop.setteleportoutsideregion` permission now works correctly\n- Added a setting to specify the maximum time a rent region can be rented in advance: `maxRentTime` in default.yml. This prevents players from renting a region a year in advance, instead they have to extend their rent every now and then.\n- Added `areashop.teleportsignall` permission to teleport to signs of region you do not own (default for OPs)\n- If a language string contains tags other then `%0%`, `%1%`, `%2%` etc, then all tags for regions can be used (check the config.yml file on the [Config System](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/regionbuyandrent/pages/the-config-system/) page to see all available tags)\n- All places where tags can be used, now also language strings can be inserted. Use `%lang:<key>%`, where <key> is the part before the colon in the language file. All tags that are available in the original string will be available in the inserted language string.\n- The default commands that are executed by clicking on signs now use the full `/areashop` instead of `/as` to prevent collisions with commands of other plugins.\n- The number of digits behind the decimal point of prices can be changed with the `fractionalNumbers` setting in config.yml, the setting `hideEmptyFractionalPart` determines if the `.0` part of a number should be hidden or not. Default settings produce numbers like this: `$10`, `$5,50`, `$3.45`.\n- Fixed a bug with with money withdrawal: If a player is in world A and buys a region in world B the plugin now correctly withdraws money from world B.\n- Added a setting to force a user to be in the correct world before he can buy/rent a region: `restrictedToWorld` in default.yml\n- Added a setting to force a user to be inside the region before he can buy/rent it: `restrictedToRegion` in default.yml\n- Added a warning system for players to indicate their rent is running out, `expirationWarningProfiles` section in the config. Different times can be specifed when a message should be sent and a custom list of commands can be executed (all region tags can be used)\n- Added a settting `warningOnLoginTime` to default.yml, when a rent region has less then this time left when the owner of it logs in it will send a warning message to the owner.\n- The command `/as rentduration` is renamed to `/as setduration` to be consistent with the other commands\n- The flagprofiles changed, owners and members now take a list of UUID's, when setting to a region only these will be set (others are cleared). It is now possible to add groups to owners/members by using `g:<group>` in the list, this does the same as `/region addmember <region> g:<group>`. It is now possible to specify the group a flag is about, use `g:<members|non_members|owners|non_owners|all>`, can for example be used to only let members of a region walk into it.\n- If a schematic is wrongly sized compared to the region size AreaShop will print a warning in the console (but it will still restore it)\n\n#### Performance improvements\n- Operations that change/check multiple regions have been changed to do this spread over multiple ticks (now it does a certain number of regions per second instead of all at once, prevents lag spikes for if you have a lot of regions). At the bottom of the config is a section `Limits and Timings` where the speed of these tasks can be changed. The following actions have been changed to this new system (NEW indicates that this is added for a new feature of this update):\n  - Checking expiration of rent regions\n  - Updating of regions when using `/as updaterents` or `/as updatebuys`\n  - Checking of regions for players that are inactive for too long (NEW)\n  - Periodic sign updates of regions for when it has tags like `%timeleft%` (NEW)\n  - Saving region files, now regions only get saved every 10 minutes now by default. Only regions that actually changed will be saved, when shutting down the server it will also safe the regions to prevent data loss. This task also handles saving the groups.yml file (also only saved when necessary) and saving of WorldGuard regions (uses the saveChanged() method of WorldGuard to only save regions that require it).\n  - Checking for when to send warning about rent expiration to players (NEW)\n"}
