This is better for several reasons:\r\n   * Buckets that are not open to the public, but are listable or are only open to authenticated users are now properly found\r\n   * Regions are no longer needed\r\n* Due to the change to use boto, AWS credentials are nearly required. The tool will still run without them, but results will be incredibly inaccurate. Users will receive a warning if credentials are not found.\r\n* The `buckets.txt` file now contains only bucket names instead of `bucket:region`\r\n* The screen output now says whether or not the bucket was found. The concept of 'open' vs 'closed' buckets no longer exists. This may change in the future.\r\n* The newly added `checkBucketWithoutCreds` will now issue a maximum of 2 requests to check if a bucket exists. This helps ease the issue of 503's being returned intermittently. \r\n* When dumping a bucket, the user can see that it's being dumped but doesn't get the ugly output. This is to allow the user to still cancel with Ctrl+C. A dumping progress feature will most likely be implemented in the future.\r\n* If a bucket doesn't allow listing of it's contents, the size will be \"AccessDenied\" or \"AllAccessDisabled\". \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* *Added:* `getAcl()` to try to get the ACLs associated with found buckets. They're currently only output to the screen.\r\n* *Removed:* The `--default-region` argument. The new way of checking if buckets exist doesn't need the bucket's region and neither do any of the other functions. We're region-free now baby\r\n* *Added:* The `--version` argument. Pretty self-explanatory\r\n* *Removed:* The `--include-closed` argument. Now that the tool is more self-aware of the permissions on a bucket, it can be hard to determine what makes a bucket \"open\" or \"closed\". Disabling for now until I determine a better way to handle it.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* #33 - *Public-ness is not accurate* - Using boto now fixes this\r\n* #32 - *Buckets in bucket-stream form return 'not found'* - `s3scanner.py` now parses the bucket name out and ignores the region\r\n* #43 - *Cancelling bucket dumping doesn't work*  - Implicitly fixed because now the dump process is not in the foreground.\r\n\r\n## Dev\r\n* The travis-ci config was changed to allow for 4 total jobs: run Python 2.7 and 3.6 and run each version with and without AWS credentials configured.\r\n* A testing requirement matrix was [created in the wiki](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner/wiki#testing-scenario-matrix) to allow for easier tracking of test coverage.\r\n* Added tests:\r\n   * test_checkBucketInvalidName()\r\n   * test_checkAwsCreds()\r\n   * test_checkBucketName() \r\n   * test_checkBucketWithoutCreds() \r\n* Removed tests:\r\n   * test_checkIncludeClosed()\r\n   * test_outputFormat()\r\n"}

Many open buckets will show up as closed if creds aren't given.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* #34 - *GetBucketSize() doesn't get the size of buckets* - @vysec added a workaround for now. Thanks!\r\n* #31 - *Bucket names with punctuation break scanning* - Added checks to verify candidate bucket names conform to the [Amazon S3 bucket name conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html). \r\n* #29 -  *Remove test.txt* - Removed test.txt which served no purpose. (?)\r\n\r\n## Dev\r\n* The function `test_setup` was added as a noobish way to do test setup. Probably a better way to do it with pytest.\r\n* #35 - Test: test_listBucket()\r\n* Added test scenarios to existing test to avoid #31 regressions."}
