================================

Development downloads can be found here: [https://ci.minebench.de/job/ChestShop-3/](https://ci.minebench.de/job/ChestShop-3/)

ChestShop is an awesome plugin for managing your server's economy. 
By using chests and signs, you can effectively create your own market!

ChestShop also makes admininstators' lives easier. 
Simply drag-and-drop the .jar to your "plugins" folder and you're done! 

If you need any help - just ask. There is a ticket system, in which you can report bugs, suggest improvements and more.
Don't be fooled though - you might think that your ticket disappeared, however that's not the case.   
You should configure the system to show **"All tickets"**, instead of only **"All open"** - you can do that by clicking on the "Filters".

#### Installing

#### Installing external dependencies
