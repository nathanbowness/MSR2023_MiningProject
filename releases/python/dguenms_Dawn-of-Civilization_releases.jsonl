health and happiness from resources\r\n    * Each instance of a resource provides happiness or health to a limited number of cities (3 for most happiness resources, 1-3 for health resources)\r\n    * Cities with higher culture have priority when receiving happiness or health from resources\r\n    * Units or building effects that require resources are still available for all cities\r\n    * City resource screen shows if a resource is in effect and how many additional resources are needed based on the city's culture rank\r\n* New rules around city conquest\r\n    * Culture conversion on city conquest is temporary and immediately reverted when a city is conquered again\r\n    * Culture conversion also applies to traded cities\r\n    * Culture conversion on city conquest does not affect core tiles of the previous owner\r\n    * Converted culture from city conquest does not affect destroyed buildings\r\n    * Restored culture garrison rules\r\n    * City conquest can result in the loss of more than one population\r\n    * Population loss and building damage is gradually applied while a city is in unrest\r\n    * Number of buildings destroyed affects amount of pillaged gold\r\n    * Building destruction is more deterministic\r\n    * Some buildings are more likely to be destroyed than others\r\n    * Defensive buildings are automatically destroyed unless city defenses have not been bombarded\r\n    * Cities can be sacked: \r\n        * Increased building damage\r\n\t* Increased pillaged gold\r\n\t* Increased unrest\r\n\t* Some owner culture removed\r\n\t* Non-state

razed immediately, instead they lose population over time and are destroyed when the population reaches zero\r\n* Updated spy experience rules: spy experience depends on espionage mission modified by success chance\r\n* Failed religious persecution does not result in unrest\r\n* Increased maximum trade routes per city to ten\r\n* Minor players cannot be involved in events\r\n* Aircraft can only be
