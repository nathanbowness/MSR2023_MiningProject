One annotation per model class, instead of the old Stag (different annotation for every field).\n  - `@UseStag` takes `FieldOption` enum which specifies what fields Stag should pick up\n    - `FieldOption.ALL`: marks **all** fields in a class for adapter generation. This is the default setting used by Stag if you don't specify any field option. This is the option you should choose in most scenarios. Unless marked with a `@SerializedName` annotation, the variable name will be used as the JSON key. There is no longer a reason to mark fields with `@GsonAdapterKey` to have them be picked up by Stag.\n    - `FieldOption.NONE`: marks the class for adapter generation, but none of the class's immediate fields will be picked up by Stag. Only fields in the inheritance hierarchy will be picked up. See `VideoList.java` for an example of a class that has no immediate fields that need parsing, but has inherited fields.\n    - `FieldOption.SERIALIZED_NAME`: This option only chooses fields marked with the `@SerializedName` or `@GsonAdapterKey` to be used by Stag. This will behave the same way as the previous versions of stag behaved.\n- Added support for `@SerializedName` in favor of `@GsonAdapterKey`\n- Deprecated `@GsonAdapterKey`. **Note: this annotation will be removed in v2.1.0, so you are advised to use this release to move over completely to** `@UseStag`. `@GsonAdapterKey` will currently take precedence over `@SerializedName` on fields annotated with both for backwards compatibility reasons.\n- Created `KnownTypeAdapters` and moved it to `stag-library` module so that it doesn't have to be generated at compile time. As a result, the `stag-library` module now has a hard dependency on `gson:2.8.0`. Previously, only the `stag-library-compiler` module depended on Gson, so it wouldn't interfere with the version you use locally. However, now `gson:2.8.0` is required, unless you exclude it from the dependency.\n- Performance was improved, as much reflection as possible was removed.\n- Native support for enums, maps, and all primitive types supported by Gson.\n- Fields marked with the `transient` keyword will be excluded from parsing\n- Parsing errors on primitive types are no longer swallowed but are bubbled up.\n- Various bugfixes and edge cases handled\n- Please refer to the sample app and sample model in order to see all sorts of proper usage of the library.\n- Thanks to @anirudhramanan and @yasirmhd for doing the vast majority of the work on this release. Also thanks to @wilrnh for moving the build system over to TravisCI.\n"}
