## How to use

Set the time via the clock icon in the top left.  You may set presets by choosing a time then holding down on one of the three preset buttons.

Pause / resume via the button in the bottom left, and stop the timer via the button in the bottom right.  The top right button is the preference button.

Animation may be toggled between an image and one of four circle animations, chosen from the preferences screen.

It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.
