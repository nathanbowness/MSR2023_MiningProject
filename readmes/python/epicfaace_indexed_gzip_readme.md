## Overview


The `indexed_gzip` project is a Python extension which aims to provide a
drop-in replacement for the built-in Python `gzip.GzipFile` class, the
`IndexedGzipFile`.


`indexed_gzip` was written to allow fast random access of compressed
[NIFTI](http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/) image files (for which GZIP is the
de-facto compression standard), but will work with any GZIP file.
`indexed_gzip` is easy to use with `nibabel` (http://nipy.org/nibabel/).


The standard `gzip.GzipFile` class exposes a random access-like interface (via
its `seek` and `read` methods), but every time you seek to a new point in the
uncompressed data stream, the `GzipFile` instance has to start decompressing
from the beginning of the file, until it reaches the requested location.


An `IndexedGzipFile` instance gets around this performance limitation by
building an index, which contains *seek points*, mappings between
corresponding locations in the compressed and uncompressed data streams. Each
seek point is accompanied by a chunk (32KB) of uncompressed data which is used
to initialise the decompression algorithm, allowing us to start reading from
any seek point. If the index is built with a seek point spacing of 1MB, we
only have to decompress (on average) 512KB of data to read from any location
in the file.


## Intended use


You may find `indexed_gzip` useful if you need to read from large GZIP files.
A major advantage of `indexed_gzip` is that it will work with any GZIP file.
However, if you have control over the creation of your GZIP files, you may
wish to consider some alternatives:

 * [`mgzip`](https://github.com/vinlyx/mgzip/) provides an accelerated
   GZIP compression and decompression library.
 * Compression formats other than GZIP, such as `bzip2` and `xz`, have better
   support for random access.


## Installation


`indexed_gzip` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) - to
install, simply type:
```sh
pip install indexed_gzip
```


You can also install `indexed_gzip` from conda-forge:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge indexed_gzip
```

To compile `indexed_gzip`, make sure you have [cython](http://cython.org/)
installed (and `numpy` if you want to compile the tests), and then run:
```sh
python setup.py develop
```


To run the tests, type the following; you will need `numpy`, `nibabel`,
`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, and `coverage` installed:

```sh
python -m indexed_gzip.tests
```

## Usage


You can use the `indexed_gzip` module directly:


```python
import indexed_gzip as igzip

# You can create an IndexedGzipFile instance
# by specifying a file name, or an open file
# handle. For the latter use, the file handle
# must be opened in read-only binary mode.
# Write support is currently non-existent.
myfile = igzip.IndexedGzipFile('big_file.gz')

some_offset_into_uncompressed_data = 234195

# The index will be automatically
# built on-demand when seeking.
myfile.seek(some_offset_into_uncompressed_data)
data = myfile.read(1048576)
```


## Using with in-memory data

You can use `indexed_gzip` with any Python file-like object. For example:

```python

import io
import indexed_gzip as igzip

# Load some gzip data from somewhere
with open('my_file.gz') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Create an IndexedGzipFile based on the
# in-memory data buffer
gzf = igzip.IndexedGzipFile(fileobj=io.BytesIO(data))
uncompressed = gzf.read(1048576)
```


## Using with `nibabel`


You can use `indexed_gzip` with `nibabel`. `nibabel` >= 2.3.0 will
automatically use `indexed_gzip` if it is present:


```python
import nibabel as nib

image = nib.load('big_image.nii.gz')
```


If you are using `nibabel` 2.2.x, you need to explicitly set the
`keep_file_open` flag:


```python
import nibabel as nib

image = nib.load('big_image.nii.gz', keep_file_open='auto')
```


To use `indexed_gzip` with `nibabel` 2.1.0 or older, you need to do a little
more work:


```python
import nibabel      as nib
import indexed_gzip as igzip

# Here we are using 4MB spacing between
# seek points, and using a larger read
# buffer (than the default size of 16KB).
fobj = igzip.IndexedGzipFile(
    filename='big_image.nii.gz',
    spacing=4194304,
    readbuf_size=131072)

# Create a nibabel image using
# the existing file handle.
fmap = nib.Nifti1Image.make_file_map()
fmap['image'].fileobj = fobj
image = nib.Nifti1Image.from_file_map(fmap)

# Use the image ArrayProxy to access the
# data - the index will automatically be
# built as data is accessed.
vol3 = image.dataobj[:, :, :, 3]
```


## Index import/export


If you have a large file, you may wish to pre-generate the index once, and
save it out to an index file:


```python
import indexed_gzip as igzip

# Load the file, pre-generate the
# index, and save it out to disk.
fobj = igzip.IndexedGzipFile('big_file.gz')
fobj.build_full_index()
fobj.export_index('big_file.gzidx')
```


The next time you open the same file, you can load in the index:


```python
import indexed_gip as igzip
fobj = igzip.IndexedGzipFile('big_file.gz', index_file='big_file.gzidx')
```


## Write support


`indexed_gzip` does not currently have any support for writing. Currently if
you wish to write to a file, you will need to save the file by alternate means
(e.g.  via `gzip` or `nibabel`), and then re-create a new `IndexedGzipFile`
instance.  For example:


```python

import nibabel as nib

# Load the entire image into memory
image = nib.load('big_image.nii.gz')
data = image.get_data()

# Make changes to the data
data[:, :, :, 5] *= 100

# Save the image using nibabel
nib.save(data, 'big_image.nii.gz')

# Re-load the image
image = nib.load('big_image.nii.gz')
```


## Performance


A small [test script](indexed_gzip/tests/benchmark.py) is included with
`indexed_gzip`; this script compares the performance of the `IndexedGzipFile`
class with the `gzip.GzipFile` class. This script does the following:

  1. Generates a test file.

  2. Generates a specified number of seek locations, uniformly spaced
     throughout the test file.

  3. Randomly shuffles these locations

  4. Seeks to each location, and reads a chunk of data from the file.


This plot shows the results of this test for a few compresed files of varying
sizes, with 500 seeks:
