However, there is also a rv64i base instruction set which widens registers to 64 bits and defines new instructions to handle 32-bit modular arithmetic. A list of instructions added by rv64i and brief explanation of the general differences between rv32 and rv64 is on the [wiki](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/wiki/Differences-between-32-bit-and-64-bit-modes). This release adds an option to switch between the base instruction sets.\r\n\r\nWhen I initially ported RARS, I did not include support for rv64i because it seemed unnecessary. However, relatively recently, I became aware that a number of people teaching with RARS would like support for rv64i because the textbook they use uses rv64i and it can be confusing to students to deal with translating the minor differences. Additionally, the software ecosystem for RISC-V supports rv64i much better than rv32i so it is a nice bonus to allow better interoperability with other software.\r\n\r\nSome relevant issues that include discussion about this major addition are #73, #74, and #78.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor Additions:\r\n  - Added the `fp` alias for x8 (#64). Thanks to @martinberger for pointing this out.\r\n  - @jowens added a tool that logs instructions executed, and memory accesses (#58, #68)\r\n  - Added mars-like system calls for doubles (#66)\r\n  - Non-standard format `jalr t0,-100(t1)` used in H&P now works (#81). Thanks to @BenjaminBeichler for adding this.\r\n  \r\nBugfixes: \r\n  - Fix execution of loads and store with negative offsets from binary values (e8ae3981b82bc0ecb7eaf2de20f72c305160e02b)\r\n  - Loading the word 0 now correctly causes an illegal instruction exception (ef4862a2185cba32163240f9ae9fc4a530a3f121)\r\n  - Digital Lab Sim's help text now correctly displays addressees when working with non-default memory configurations. (#69). Thanks to @phummel for fixing this.\r\n  - Fix missing tooltips for some CSRs. (3c970b95f271f9bfd4186b2999741fbd37db2fe2)\r\n  - Fix timertool example to not use the label time (#79, #80). Thanks to @darnuria for fixing this.\r\n  - Fix incorrect assertions that make timertool.s hang (#80). Thanks to @darnuria  for finding this.\r\n  - Keyboard Simulator now correctly locks and therefore doesn't freeze RARS (#82). Thanks to @quinnlp for finding this.\r\n  - Fix JALR incorrectly jumping when source register = destination (ee095d5b87c7769f4fd766227ddb5c8dd7991ddd)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheThirdOne/rars/releases/28532268/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}}

This allows setting the `fflags` CSR and obeying non-default rounding modes.\r\n    - Some previously unknown bugs were also fixed\r\n    - All floating point tests from [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) now pass\r\n  - Improved GCC and clang compatibility (#16)\r\n    - Various directives for starting sections have been added (.sdata, .section, ...)\r\n    - Undocumented psuedo-ops `fgt.s`, `fge.s` are now supported (66f1f426f31e7eecb3e944815a27442b0482ecd3)\r\n  - Support for double extension\r\n    - With the two above changes, it made sense to also add the D extension as it helps with compatibility and is more relevant as detailed lessons about floating poitn can now be taught with RARS\r\n    - This necessitated a change in UI for the floating point register window. With the hexadecimal setting, values last accessed as doubles will be 64 bit wide and values accessed as floats will be 32 bit wide.\r\n  - CSRs are much better supported (#2, #49, #52, #61, #62)\r\n    - time CSR has been added as a reference to system time\r\n    - CSR instructions can now take the name of the register rather than number as an argument (c1cd1af56)\r\n    - Write protected read ignored bits (WPRI) in CSRs are actually write protected now. (12e0b96307)\r\n    - CSRs numbers larger than 0xFF can be assembled (c40643acdd25b2)\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n  - Bitmap display tool now works with stores smaller than a word (#47). Credit to @PedroAugustoRamalhoDuarte for finding this\r\n  - Settings properly persist over restarts again (#46). Credit to @ProfPierce for finding this\r\n  - It is no longer possible to deadlock the UI by trying to connect a tool (#48). Credit to @PedroAugustoRamalhoDuarte for finding this\r\n  - The `instreth` CSR now has the correct number (#49). Credit to @mvlamar for finding this\r\n  - Any CSR number in range can be assembled (#52). Credit to @mvlamar for finding this\r\n  - Fix bugs in the CLI, (0703e794abcae721bc6c56185e8f010ce6a1a317)\r\n  - Integer division operations no longer set divide by zero flag in fcsr (0ebea268).\r\n  - Fix some floating pointer instruction bugs (dc832899).\r\n\r\nInternal changes:\r\n  - Code was refactored into a src directory\r\n  - Tests that catch the some of the most common typos have been added. \r\n\r\n"}

Its primary goal is to be an effective development environment for people getting started with RISC-V. It is a direct port of MARS, the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator; the code specific to MIPS was switch out with new code to support assembling and running RISC-V assembly.\r\n\r\nThe included jar can be run without arguments to launch the IDE or it can be run in the terminal with arguments to  \r\n\r\n## Changes from MARS\r\n\r\nRARS was built on MARS 4.5 and owes a lot to the development of MARS; its important to note what are new developments and what come straight from MARS. Besides moving from supporting MIPS to RISC-V and the associated small changes, there are several general changes worth noting.\r\n\r\nInstructions can now be hot-loaded like Tools. If you want to support an additional extension to the RISC-V instruction set. the .class files just need to be added to the right folder\r\n  - ScreenMagnifier, MARS Bot, Intro to Tools, Scavenger Hunt, and MARS Xray were removed from the included tools. ScreenMagnifier, MARS Bot, Intro to Tools, and Scavenger Hunt were removed because they provide little benefit. And MARS Xray was removed because it is not set up to work with RISC-V, however if someone ports it, it could be merged in.\r\n  - Removed delayed branching\r\n  - Removed the print feature\r\n  - Added a testing framework to verify compatability with the RISC-V specification\r\n  - Significant internal restructuring and refactoring.\r\n\r\nFor smaller changes refer to all of the [commit history](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/compare/89b8932d7...d19b208)\r\n\r\n## Difficulties I faced while making this\r\n\r\nImplementing the RISC-V floating point extension correctly in Java is *really* hard; it requires pretty much a full implementation of IEEE 754-2008. As far as I know there is not even a complete implementation of IEEE 754. As a result the floating point implementation in RARS is not completely compliant there are a fair number of issue that cannot be easily be fixed.\r\n\r\nThere aren't any good resources for getting ready to be able to implement the instruction set. Some time in the future, I would like to make a website which explains briefly all of the instructions along with an example program which uses it. If something like that had existed when I started learning, I think I could have gotten up to speed much more quickly. \r\n\r\n## Potential next steps\r\n\r\nI think it may be possible to make a complete implementation of IEEE 754 - 2008 in Java. However, it won't be fast. I think I may take a few weeks to try to make a library that does that. If it works well, I use it to fix up the issues RARS currently has.\r\n\r\nI am also going to look into what it would take to get RARS to be able to assemble to ELF binaries and simulate from them. This could enable greater compatibility with existing toolchains and simulators as well as enable programs being debugged in RARS to use existing compiled libraries. \r\n\r\nOf course there are also less exciting developments to be made as well. There are several known fixable bugs and polish issues to be fixed. "}
