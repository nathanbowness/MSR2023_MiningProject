Changes that have been introduced since the 2.10 release are as follows:\n\nInitial translation of code from Python 2 to Python 3. DenyHosts can now be run as either a Python 2 or a Python 3 program. The new code has been tested with Pyhton 2.7 and Python 3.4. If you require an older version of Python, please continue to use DenyHosts 2.10 and let us know of your requirements.\n\nAdded patch from Fedora to fix initial sync issue and insure info logging stream is active. \n(Provided by Jason Tibbitts.)\n\nAdded \"import logging\" to denyhosts.py to avoid errors when setting up logging. (See above change.)\n\nAdded option PF_TABLE_FILE to the configuration file. When this option is enabled it causes DenyHosts to write\nblocked IP addresses to a text file. The default location is /etc/blacklist. This text file should correspond to a PF firewall table.\n\nAt start-up, try to create the file specified by HOSTS_DENY. That way we avoid errors later if the file does not exists. Can be a problem on operating systems where /etc/hosts.deny does not exist in the default configuration.\n\nAdded regex pattern to detect invalid user accounts. This blocks connections from remote hosts who are attempting to login with accounts not found on the local system. While these connections to non-existent accounts are relatively harmless, they are usually used as part of a brute force attack and filtering them before they reach OpenSSH is a good idea.\n\nFinally, Jan-Pascal has created a sync server for DenyHosts which will allow DenyHosts services to coordinate lists of banned IP addresses. The new sync server is open source (GPLv3) and can be set up on private servers, networks and VPS. We plan to set up our own sync server in the near future. When a sync server is created it will be announced at http://denyhost.sourceforge.net/news.php\n"}

In version 2.10,\nDenyHosts can now correctly unlock stale PID files, a new systemd service unit file\nhas been added and DenyHosts now properly logs information when running in foreground\nmode. DenyHosts now detects PAM authentication errors on FreeBSD, the example PF\nfirewall rule was improved and our documentation was cleaned up. DenyHosts no\nlonger requires that ETC_DIR is declared in the configuration file, and we default\nto using /etc as our configuration directory if none is specified.\n"}
