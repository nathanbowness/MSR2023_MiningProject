Including jumping to \"plain\" constants, as well as modules that have no methods defined (for best performance install `GNU Grep`). Better filtering out of irrelevant files.\r\n* Sorts \"jump to module\" locations, putting gems at the end.\r\n* `robe-completing-read-func` defaults to nil, to follow `completing-read-function` overrides by third-party packages automatically.\r\n* If `.robe` exists in the project root, `robe-start` loads it into the REPL.\r\n* `global-robe-mode` added.\r\n* Added completion for local and instance variable names, as well as \"jump to definition\" support. The implementation is imprecise, but fairly robust.\r\n* Fixed Ruby syntax highlighting in documentation buffers in Emacs 27.\r\n* Uses properly prefixed `cl` functions.\r\n* Assorted fixes and improvements."}
