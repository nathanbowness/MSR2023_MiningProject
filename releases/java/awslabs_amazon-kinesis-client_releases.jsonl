This optimizes memory usage, lease table IOPS usage, and number of calls made to kinesis for streams with high shard counts and/or frequent resharding.\r\n* When bootstrapping an empty lease table, KCL utilizes the ListShard API's filtering option (the ShardFilter optional request parameter) to retrieve and create leases only for a snapshot of shards open at the time specified by the ShardFilter parameter. The ShardFilter parameter enables you to filter out the response of the ListShards API, using the Type parameter. KCL uses the Type filter parameter and the following of its valid values to identify and return a snapshot of open shards that might require new leases.\r\n\t* Currently, the following shard filters are supported:\r\n\t\t* `AT_TRIM_HORIZON` - the response includes all the shards that were open at `TRIM_HORIZON`.\r\n\t\t* `AT_LATEST` - the response includes only the currently open shards of the data stream.\r\n\t    * `AT_TIMESTAMP` - the response includes all shards whose start timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp and end timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp or still open.\r\n\t* `ShardFilter` is used when creating leases for an empty lease table to initialize leases for a snapshot of shards specified at `KinesisClientLibConfiguration#initialPositionInStreamExtended`.\r\n\t* For more information about ShardFilter, see the [official AWS documentation on ShardFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ShardFilter.html).\r\n\r\n* Introducing support for the `ChildShards` response of the `GetRecords` API to perform lease/shard synchronization that happens at `SHARD_END` for closed shards, allowing a KCL worker to only create leases for the child shards of the shard it finished processing.\r\n\t* For KCL 1.x applications, this uses the `ChildShards` response of the `GetRecords` API.\r\n\t* For more information, see the official AWS Documentation on [GetRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_GetRecords.html) and [ChildShard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ChildShard.html).\r\n\r\n* KCL now also performs additional periodic shard/lease scans in order to identify any potential holes in the lease table to ensure the complete hash range of the stream is being processed and create leases for them if required. When `KinesisClientLibConfiguration#shardSyncStrategyType` is set to `ShardSyncStrategyType.SHARD_END`, `PeriodicShardSyncManager#leasesRecoveryAuditorInconsistencyConfidenceThreshold` will be used to determine the threshold for number of consecutive scans containing holes in the lease table after which to enforce a shard sync. When `KinesisClientLibConfiguration#shardSyncStrategyType` is set to `ShardSyncStrategyType.PERIODIC`, `leasesRecoveryAuditorInconsistencyConfidenceThreshold` is ignored.\r\n\t* New configuration options are available to configure `PeriodicShardSyncManager` in `KinesisClientLibConfiguration`\r\n\r\n\t| Name                                                  | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\r\n\t| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n\t| leasesRecoveryAuditorInconsistencyConfidenceThreshold | 3       | Confidence threshold for the periodic auditor job to determine if leases for a stream in the lease table is inconsistent.

These exception are treated the same as reaching the end of a shard.\r\n  * [PR #359](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/359)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the KCL would not Use the configured DynamoDB IOPs when creating the lease table.  \r\n  * [PR #360](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/360)\r\n* Make the maximum number of Scheduler initialization attempts configurable.  \r\n  The maximum number of `Scheduler` initialization attempts can be configured via `CoordinatorConfig#maxInitializationAttempts`.\r\n  * [PR #363](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/363)\r\n  * [PR #368](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/368)\r\n* Fixed an issue where it was possible to get a duplicate record when resubscribing to a shard.  \r\n  Subscribe to shard requires periodic resubscribing, and uses a new concept of a continuation sequence number.  If the continuation sequence number was equal to the last record that record would be processed a second time.  Resubscribing now uses `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to ensure that only later records are returned.  \r\n  * [PR #371](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/371)\r\n* Upgraded to AWS SDK 2.0.1  \r\n  * [PR #372](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/372)\r\n* Fixed an issue where time based restart of the subscription wasn't resetting the `lastRequestTime`.  \r\n  If a subscription hasn't delivered any data for more than 30 seconds it will be canceled and restarted.  This detection is based of the `lastRequestTime` which wasn't getting reset after the restart was triggered.\r\n  * [PR #373](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/373)\r\n* Fixed an issue where requesting on the subscription from the `FanOutRecordsPublisher` could trigger an unexpected failure.  \r\n  Due to a race condition the underlying flow in the subscription could be set to something else.  The method is now synchronized, and verifies that the subscriber it was created with is still the subscriber in affect.  \r\n  This issue generally would only appear when multiple errors were occurring while connecting to Kinesis.\r\n  * [PR #374](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/374)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the number of requested items could exceed the capacity of the RxJava queue.  \r\n  There was an off by one issue when determining whether to make a request to the SDK subscription.  This changes the calculation to represent the capacity as a queue.\r\n  * [PR #375](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/375)\r\n"}
