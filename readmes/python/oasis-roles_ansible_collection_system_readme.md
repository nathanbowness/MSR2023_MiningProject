# Ansible Collection - oasis_roles.system

This collection is focused on the Red Hat products and was originally conceived
by the QE teams tasked with doing full stack integrations. As such a wide
variety of roles are presented, some particular to Red Hat products, others
which might be applicable to any type of system.

Each role is documented individually within its root folder by its own README.md
where details of its usage, arguments, and dependencies can be found.

# Caveats

As such, the roles and modules contained herein are focused on the Red Hat family
of distributions and the products sold by the company. Other roles are also
included which are of general interest in setting up a system. There is no
prejudice against adding compatibility with other distributions, and any such
improvements and additions are welcome. Lack of support for a system is due only
to the singular focus of the original contributors.
