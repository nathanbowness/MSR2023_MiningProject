CLI Helpers is a Python package that makes it easy to perform common tasks when
building command-line apps. It's a helper library for command-line interfaces.

Libraries like `Click <http://click.pocoo.org/5/>`_ and
`Python Prompt Toolkit <https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
are amazing tools that help you create quality apps. CLI Helpers complements
these libraries by wrapping up common tasks in simple interfaces.

CLI Helpers is not focused on your app's design pattern or framework -- you can
use it on its own or in combination with other libraries. It's lightweight and
easy to extend.

What's included in CLI Helpers?

- Prettyprinting of tabular data with custom pre-processing
- Config file reading/writing
