I will offer no support for old configs or people trying to use old backup data. ##\r\n\r\n### Although I have been testing this for many months please be cautious about using this on a live server.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n* The majority of the plugin code has been re-written to SonarLint coding standard.\r\n* New main menu to show all online players (use just /ir).\r\n* MySQL support added (requires testing).\r\n* YAML backups for players are now in their own individual save files for each backup to reduce the risk of corruption.\r\n* Inventory is only saved to the file if there is anything to save reducing file size in backups.\r\n* More plugin tasks including saving data and reading backup data is now asynchronous to reduce server lag.\r\n* Added config option to enable the option to restore whole player inventory on one click.\r\n* Ender chest backups are now accessible. \r\n* Config file has been cleaned up to make it easier to read.\r\n* Can now set the number of lines visible when browsing backups to help reduce lag further.\r\n* Messages have been moved to a separate YAML file for easier customization.\r\n\r\nPlease open issues for feedback or bugs so that I can resolve them before final release."}
