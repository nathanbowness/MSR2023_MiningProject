# Vert.x Proton

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-proton/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-proton/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This component facilitates AMQP integrations for Vert.x by providing a thin wrapper around the
[Apache Qpid](http://qpid.apache.org) Proton-J AMQP 1.0 protocol engine.

In-source docs can be built by running "mvn clean package -DskipTests", at which point they are located in _target/asciidoc/java/index.adoc_. You can view the unprocessed document source file [here](src/main/asciidoc/index.adoc).
