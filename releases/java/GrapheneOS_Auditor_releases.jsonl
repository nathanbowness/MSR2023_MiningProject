several years back for use by Auditor and Android ended up implementing it as a standard feature)\r\n* enable attest key support for new pairings with an Auditee supporting it in the hardware keystore including the Pixel 6 and later (migrating to it for existing pairings will be a future improvement)\r\n* display attest key use as part of the security level with the combination of StrongBox and attest key considered to be a Very High security level instead of only High for StrongBox alone\r\n* add error handling/reporting for OS/hardware camera issues\r\n* add support for 3rd generation key attestation root for future devices\r\n* increase Auditor protocol to version 3 with a new DEFLATE dictionary including the new attestation root and an updated sample attestation chain to improve compression for easier to scan QR codes\r\n* add exception messages to sample submission and remote attestation failure notifications\r\n* update CameraX to 1.1.0-rc01 providing various improvements which are [partially documented in their release notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera#1.1.0-rc01)\r\n* update ZXing (barcode library) to 3.5.0 providing significant improvements for barcode decoding including fixes for many edge cases discovered through fuzzing where unexpected exceptions were thrown (many of these would have been serious security bugs instead of unexpected exceptions if ZXing was written in C rather than memory safe Java code)\r\n* update Kotlin Gradle plugin to 1.6.21\r\n* update Android Gradle plugin to 7.2.0\r\n\r\nA full list of changes

Android developer previews aren't supported since the hardware verified version is set to a placeholder value. The device performing verification (Auditor) just needs to be any Android 7.0+ compatible device with a camera.\r\n\r\n1. press Auditor on the device that will be verifying the Auditee\r\n2. press Auditee on the device that's going to be verified\r\n3. point the camera of the Auditee at the QR code on the Auditor to read the challenge\r\n4. tap the QR code on the Auditor to advance ahead (if you do this too early, you can press back)\r\n5. point the camera of the Auditor at the QR code on the Auditee to read the attestation\r\n6. view verification of the attestation results\r\n\r\nAn Auditor can verify any number of different Auditee devices. It shows a fingerprint and the first / last verification time in successful paired attestation results. An Auditee can be verified by any number of Auditors but there will be a different fingerprint for each unique pairing rather than the same fingerprint shown on each Auditor for the same Auditee.\r\n\r\nTo set up regularly scheduled remote verification via the remote attestation service:\r\n\r\n1. create an account on https://attestation.app/ from a separate device\r\n2. press the menu button in the app\r\n3. press the 'Enable remote verification' action in the menu\r\n4. scan the account QR code displayed on https://attestation.app/\r\n5. configure an alert email address to receive alerts if the device fails to provide valid attestations in time\r\n6. refresh https://attestation.app/ to view the initial attestation result"}
