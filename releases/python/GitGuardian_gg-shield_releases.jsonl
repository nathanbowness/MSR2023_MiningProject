instead of SendGrid Key.\r\n\r\nDo not reuse cassettes between tests, it's confusing and feels brittle.\r\n\r\nDo not activate pytest-socket by default, only turn it on in the CI. This way one can update VCR cassettes by removing the cassette files, no need to edit the pyproject.toml file. Proposed changes still need to not do any network access for the CI to pass.\r\n\r\nMake exclude tests easier to understand: all runs are now expected to exit with 0 and we check stdout to verify if the normally ignored files are there or not.
