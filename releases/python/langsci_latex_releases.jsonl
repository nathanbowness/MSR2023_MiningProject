This package can be installed from CTAN on TeX Live 2020 and is now a dependency for `langscibook`. Please see [this Wiki page](https://github.com/langsci/langscibook/wiki/Inserting-authors-and-editors-with-langsci-affiliations) and the package documentation for further details.\r\n- A compilation of monographs and edited volumes now automatically creates a bibliographical file `langsci-current-book.bib`, which contains the bibliographical information of the book. This also solves bug #79.\r\n- In text books, the boxes from `langsci-tbls` are now better embedded into the surrounding main text by adjusting the balanced skip before and after the boxes.\r\n- `\\hspaceThis` is removed. It has the same effect as `\\hphanthom`, and the latter should be used instead.\r\n- The class option `collectionchapter` is discontinued. Its functions are wholly provided by `collection`.\r\n- Added support for EAN13+2 ISBNs, i.e. multi-volume ISBNS. They have to be entered in the form `\\ISBNhardcover[+2 Addon]{ISBN-13}`\r\n- Added a new command `\\restorebottom` which resets the effects of `\\sloppybottom` mid-document.\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n- The citation recommendation on the imprint page is now produced with `biblatex` and the new cite command `\\fullciteImprint`.\r\n- Restructured `\\includepaper`; new auxiliary macro `\\lsCollectionMetadataToBibliography`."}

This option produces line numbers in the PDF, which can ease author-editor communication.\r\n* It is no longer necessary to use `\\noabstract` when a paper has an empty abstract. `\\abstract{}` will suffice.\r\n* Having multiple `\\footnotes` after each other now automatically generates a superscripted comma between the footnote indicators\r\n* Footnotes are no longer hyperlinked. This is because the feature is unreliable within `hyperref`. Since footnotes are always on the same page as their indicator, this feature does not seem to be of great use. It can also decrease useability if the reader clicks it by accident\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n* `morewrites` is no longer used, because it was related to `No room...` errors\r\n* `\\usepackage{etex} \\reverseinserts{n}` is no longer used.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with updated package versions\r\n* The discontinued `extrayear` is no longer used by `langsci-unified`. `extradate` is in use now.\r\n* KOMA script changed its `\\ifstr` to `\\Ifstr`. We now only use `\\Ifstr`.\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n* Changed the set-up of `kvoptions`\r\n* Loaded `scrbook` with option `footnotes=multiple`. \r\n* Fine-tuned the appearance of `\\epigram` in papers\r\n"}
