This release is not production ready and meant for testing the new Android P support. RxFingerprint v3 is scheduled to be released once the Android P APIs are finalized.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n### Major breaking changes:\r\n- `RxFingerprint` now has to be created via a `Builder`. \r\n- Support for Android P and the new `FingerprintDialog`.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n- `RxFingerprint.isHardwareDetected`. Prefer `rxFingerprint.isAvailable()`\r\n- `RxFingerprint.hasEnrolledFingerprints`. Prefer `rxFingerprint.isAvailable()`\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### RxFingerprint.Builder\r\nInstead of having a growing class of static methods `RxFingerprint` now has to be created and configured with a Builder.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nnew RxFingerprint.Builder(context)\r\n    .encryptionMethod(EncryptionMethod.RSA)\r\n    .keyInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)\r\n    .dialogTitleText(\"RxFingerprint\")\r\n    .dialogSubtitleText(\"Android P FingerprintDialog support coming soon...\")\r\n    .dialogDescriptionText(\"And it will keep supporting the good old FingerprintManager for devices running M and N.\")\r\n    .dialogNegativeButtonText(\"Cancel\")\r\n    .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the created instance the calls to authenticate, encrypt and decrypt are then greatly simplified and deduplicated.\r\n\r\n### Android P support\r\n#### FingerprintDialog\r\nRxFingerprint now supports the new `FingerprintDialog` provided in Android P. Depending on the Android OS version of the device RxFingerprint will either chose `FingerprintDialog` for devices running Android P or above or the old `FingerprintManager` implementation on older devices with fingerprint hardware.\r\n\r\nThe `FingerprintDialog` APIs will automatically show standardized UI that prompts the user to interact with their fingerprint sensor. The UI can be customized with the following methods in the RxFingerprint Builder:\r\n- `dialogTitleText` Title of the dialog\r\n- `dialogSubtitleText` Subtitle of the dialog\r\n- `dialogDescriptionText` Description shown in the dialog\r\n- `dialogNegativeButtonText` Text shown on the button that cancels the fingerprint operation\r\n\r\n#### Prompting users to register a Fingerprint\r\nAndroid P supports opening the system preferences and leading the user to the Fingerprint setup screen.\r\nThis can be done by calling `rxFingerprint.launchFingerprintEnrollment()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease provide any feedback, issues or bugs you encounter while testing this version of `RxFingerprint` in the [Issues](https://github.com/Mauin/RxFingerprint/issues)."}
