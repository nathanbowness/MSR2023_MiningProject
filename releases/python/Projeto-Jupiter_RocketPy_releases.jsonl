It's an awesome feature created by @FranzYuri in https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/pull/110 and #123. A [new section in our Environment Class Example notebook](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/notebooks/environment_class_usage.html#Datetime) was added to demonstrate how this can be used\r\n\r\n## Bug corrections\r\n* **Aerodynamic forces evaluation**\r\n    * We improved our Airfoil implementation in order to solve a bug with airfoil input data.  See #140 to undesrtand the problem, and the awesome resolution by @MateusStano\r\n    * Our aerodynamic was also improved to allow better calculation of roll moment of rockets with canted angle fins. See the great work done by @MateusStano on #116.\r\n* **Weird stable rockets with negative static margins**\r\n    * Issue #115 solved by @Lucas-KB in https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/pull/125, helped by @lucasfourier and @giovaniceotto \r\n    * This issue only affected rockets which had one or more diameter reductions (such as tails), making them seem more stable than they should be, and caused problems from v0.9.7 until v0.9.9. New tests have been implemented to make sure this never happens again, making RocketPy significantly more trustworthy.\r\n\r\n* **Function class initialization**\r\n    * Fixed input name for some Functions instances initialized with int/float or callable by @giovaniceotto in https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/pull/141\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n* We are raising a warning when the user tries to use Environment Forecast Models without installing netCDF4 library, good work done by @skrobchik in https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/pull/127\r\n*  RocketPy now has a parachute.py, which was created by @FranzYuri in https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/pull/113. It was an enhancement in the organization of our Rocket class\r\n* We are adding a [SolidMotor_class_usage](https://github.com/Projeto-Jupiter/RocketPy/blob/v0.10.0/docs/notebooks/solid_motor_class_usage.ipynb) notebook in order to better illustrate how this class works.
