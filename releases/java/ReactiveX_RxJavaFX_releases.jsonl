There should be no breaking changes to upgrade to this version, however there are some sweeping deprecations as well as some new features.\n- Nearly all factories in `JavaFxObservable` have been deprecated and replaced with more concise factory names inspired by [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX#observablevalue-invalidations-and-changes). For instance, `fromObservableValue()` is now `valuesOf()`. The [RxJavaFX Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/thomasnield/rxjavafx-guide/details) will be updated later to reflect these new naming conventions. \n- In `JavaFxObservable`, there are now `nonNullValuesOf()` and `nonNullChangesOf()` factories that effectively supress null values emitted from an `ObservableValue`. \n- The `CompositeObservable` @Beta tag has been removed. \n- A new set of Transformers have been provided  via the `JavaFxTransformers` static class. These are new Rx operators specific to JavaFX\n  - `doOnNextFx()` - same as `doOnNext()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnCompletedFx()` - same as `doOnCompleted()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnErrorFx()` - same as `doOnError()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnSubscribeFx()` - same as `doOnSubscribe()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnUnsubscribeFx()` - same as `doOnUnsubscribe()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnTerminateFx()` - same as `doOnTerminate()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnNextCount()` - performs the provided action with the emission count for each `onNext()` call\n  - `doOnCompletedCount()` - performs the provided action with the emission count for an `onCompleted()` call\n  - `doOnErrorCount()` - performs the provided action with the emission count for an `onError()` call\n  - `doOnNextCountFx()` - same as `doOnNextCount()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnCompletedCountFx()` - same as `doOnCompletedCount()` but executes on FX thread\n  - `doOnErrorCountFx()` - same as `doOnErrorCount()` but executes on FX thread\n\nThe `doOnXXXCount()` operators are helpful for updating the UI with a status on how many emissions have been processed (e.g. through a `ProgressBar` or a simple `Label` with the count). \n\nThe `1.x` branch is now the primary branch. Next on the roadmap is to implement this library with RxJava 2.0 on the `2.x` branch. [RxJava 2.0 brings some drastic changes with it](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0) and we will need a separate RxJavaFX 2.0 implementation to support it. \n\n[RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX) will get a 1.0 release this week as well. \n"}
