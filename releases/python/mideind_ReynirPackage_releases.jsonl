New properties include `_Sentence.lemmas_and_cats` and `_Sentence.categories`, and the method `Greynir.parse_tokens()` has been added.\r\n* Grammar and vocabulary improvements.\r\n* Better handling of abbreviations and multi-word prepositions.\r\n* Improved type annotations in the main Greynir API.\r\n* Added tests.\r\n* New features documented and examples added."}
