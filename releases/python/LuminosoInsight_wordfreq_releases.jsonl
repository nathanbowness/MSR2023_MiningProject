That happens\r\n  instead in a place that's internal to the `word_frequency` function, so we can\r\n  look at the values of the digits before they're replaced.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- wordfreq is now developed using `poetry` as its package manager, and with\r\n  `pyproject.toml` as the source of configuration instead of `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n- The minimum version of Python supported is 3.7.\r\n\r\n- Type information is exported using `py.typed`.\r\n"}
