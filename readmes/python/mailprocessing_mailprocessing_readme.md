maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting
-- i.e., moving, copying, forwarding and deleting mail according to a
set of rules. It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but
instead of being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the
delivery chain), maildirproc only processes already delivered mail.

imapproc is a program that processes one or more folders on an IMAP
server. Much like maildirproc it sorts, e.g. moves, copies and forwards
email. It uses the same filter configuration mechanism as maildirproc: a
Python script that hooks into maildirprocs processing code.
