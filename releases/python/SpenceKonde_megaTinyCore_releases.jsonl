Hopefully this will work better, but the debacle brought down CI testing, which needs to be able to install the last release, so there may very well be problems that it would have caught, had 2.6.0 not been an unmitigated disaster. \r\n\r\nThe big Bugfix/enhancements from 2.6.0/2.6.1 are:\r\n* Serious issues in Event for tinyAVR 0/1-series parts have been corrected, and the logic and comparator libraries can now (by not touching ComparatorN.attachInterrupt(), manually define an interrupt with attachInterrupt. The same goes for Logic (though with the CCL , all the LUTs share one ISR). \r\n* Bugs relating to waking from sleep modes other than idle (which is the \"why am I bopther with this\" sleep mode that barely saves any power) while acting as TWI slave have been fixed and it now wakes reliably from all sleep modes, including TWI address match (which is one of few privileged things that can wake from power down sleep mode]\r\n* A pair of enhancements to serial from completely different angles have been added:\r\n  * Thanks to the work of @MX682X we have been able to take yet another piece of the disastrous Arduino API out behind the woodshed to get what it deserves. By reworking the class hierarchy, we have slashed the number of flash wasting virtual member functions, which the compiler is required to generate even when they are never called. The savings is on the order of around 500 bytes. That's not going to excite people working with 32k parts, but we absolutely do have users on 2k and 4k parts for whom 500 bytes is a great blessing. \r\n  * That is in spite of my adding functionality to Serial: getStatus(), autobaud support see the [serial reference] (https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/Ref_Serial.md) and should now automatically dodge the SFDEN errata so you should be able to wake on that. \r\n\r\nFull list of changes:\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Correct several USART bugs that snuck through, including an apparent regression that would prevent proper serial operation.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Azduino5 was no good. Same filesystem structure error as usual, moved to Azduino6.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: The 4000 lines of workarounds for compatibility issues introduced by the toolchain update didn't make it into the megaTinyCore release.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: The platform.txt file had been trashed by a bungled merge and tried to upload based on params that didn't exist.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Correct an include path that confused some alternative IDEs.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Correct compile error involving RS485 USART configuration.\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Comparator library namespace error fixed. (thanks @ObviousInRetrospect)\r\n* 2.6.0 Bugfix: Advertised 2 MHz internal option was not actually available in non-tuned configurations. Prior to 2.6.0 there was no intent to support this.\r\n* Enhancement: millis with a type B timer is over 25% faster, and uses 30% less flash for the ISR. (thanks @MX683X)\r\n* Bugfix: Correct a few anomalies in boards.txt.\r\n\r\n### 2.6.0\r\n* You can now enable and disable the ADC with analogPowerOption() and enable/disable standby mode.\r\n* Bugfix: Fix issue with SSD bit being cleared when using beginTransaction().\r\n* Bugfix: Fix bug in Logic with pin inputs being handled improperly.\r\n* Bugfix: Remove multiple signatures for Wire.requestFrom to fix issues with Wire with certain libraries.\r\n* Bugfix: Correct tuning, particularly to speeds below 16 MHz. Boards should be re-tuned if 14 MHz-derived speed is to be used\r\n* Bugfix: Correct default option for Optiboot 2-series boards with 20 pins to be the one with alt reset.\r\n* Bugfix: `long_soft_event` method did not work correctly.\r\n* Bugfix: Removed attempted optimization by inlining analogReadEnh; I had wrongly assumed that it would then not inline the call to `_analogReadEnh`. Well, it wound up inlining it, with the result being exactly what I had hoped to prevent. I don't think this made it into a release.\r\n* Bugfix: Event was not functioning correctly on tinyAVR parts.\r\n* Bugfix: Correct bug(s) when waking from sleep mode via TWI (aka I2C/Wire) address match (Thanks @MX682X. You are one of our MVPs). TWI slaves should now *reliably* wake on address match and other wake sources from all sleep modes.\r\n* Bugfix: 3224 optiboot maximum upload size was same as 1624. Oops.\r\n* Bugfix: Microchip boards in optiboot mode (admittedly a rare mode) were not subtracting the size of the bootloader from the chip capacity.\r\n* Enhancement: Lay groundwork in Event library for the new event system changes in the EA-series (There will be 2 generators per port, and 2 for RTC - but all of these will be accessible by all event channels, and a register on the peripheral controls which of the options is used for these two channels). While inapplicable to tinyAVR, Event.h and Event.cpp distributed with DxCore and megaTinyCore is identical.\r\n* Bugfix: Fix compatibility of Comparator, Event, and Logic.\r\n* Workaround: mysterious issues with detecting the major version that prevented manual installation ever since 1.8.14. I kept hoping that the next version would fix it, but, no such luck. It still impacted used on 1.8.19 and likely future versions as well.\r\n* Major enhancement: Change class hierarchy for UARTs, as was done for Two_Wire (Wire.h), so that rather than pulling in api/HardwareSerial.h, and subclassing that definition of HardwareSerial (itself a subclass of Stream) as UartClass, we instead simply subclass Stream directly. UART.h will be renamed to HardwareSerial.h, HardwareSerial.h (a compatibility layer) will be renamed to UART.h and the latter adjusted to #define UartClass as HardwareSerial, and api/HardwareSerial.h will be gutted and simply #include <HardwareSerial.h> This will remove yet another piece of the disastrous \"ArduinoAPI\". I describe it as such because on low resource platforms like AVR; this will allow several functions currently declared virtual to lose that keyword, as the linker, even with LTO enabled, is not permitted to remove unused virtual functions. This reduces binary size when using serial significantly, despite significant new features. Credit goes to @MX624X.\r\n* Enhancement: Split up the Event and Logic library headers for improved readability.\r\n* Enhancement: RTC millis does not interfere with waking on RTC compare match. (PR #793)\r\n* Enhancement: great deal of harmonization with DxCore.\r\n* Enhancement: Improvement to stream timed read to make it work when millis is disabled, and to save 4 bytes of RAM. Note that this also requires all offsets used to access the Serial transmit and receive buffers to be reduced accordingly in the inline assembly in UART.cpp.\r\n* New Feature: Now you can use ADC1 just like it was an ADC0, see the notes in [Analog Input (ADC) and output (DAC)](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/Ref_Analog.md) for steps required to enable it. This does not use space if not enabled.\r\n* New Feature: Add new functions to assist checking error codes in analogRead results.\r\n* New Feature: Permit Logic and Comparator ISRs to be defined manually if (and only if!) the `.attachInterrupt()` method of an instance of that class is not called. You can then manually create the ISR saving about 40 bytes and 50 clock cycles, give or take.\r\n* New Feature: megaTinyCore.h now provides functions to reset chip via WDT timeout and via software reset. If optiboot is used, the former will not run it, while the latter will.\r\n* New Feature: Add option for serial autobaud use, record cumulative errors USART has encountered and provide method to view and clear them.\r\n* New Feature: Support SFD to wake on USART. User is otherwise responsible to configuring this and should be aware that in order to be able to receive the characters, we turn it off after receiving a character.\r\n* Docs: made clear om PowerSave.md that the ADC must be disabled to get low standbby current.\r\n* Docs: Add link to my article on AVR math speed (TLDR: avoid `int64_t` `long long` like the plague)\r\n* Docs: Fix many documentation issues, improve docs generally.\r\n* Docs: Expand documentation significantly, and document the new serial features.\r\n* Unenhancement: Remove getAnalogSampleDuration(), as I could not make anything compile with that in and had worked on it over a day.\r\n* Enhancement: 2 MHz is now a supported clock speed.\r\n\r\n", "mentions_count": 2}

It removes support for disabling a single specific interrupt only during an SPI transaction. Note that you are free to *manually* do so, and the result will take far less than the 800 bytes wasted by the general implementation. And could be used on any interrupt(s) not just a single pin interrupt that was *attached* (one should try to avoid attachInterrupt entirely if possible  as it is both slow and inefficient. This allows the attachInterrupt changes to reap the full flash size benefits that motivated it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally  few other significant changes went in:\r\n* By unanimous demand of users (a large discussion yielded many voices in favor of this change, and not one against it), pinMode no longer emulates classic AVR behavior (where turning on the pullup set the output register, so when then flipped to output, the pin would be HIGH. The consensus in that thread was that a sketch relying on that behavior is in the thing acting in error. \r\n* Fixes several issues with the compatibility macos provided to paper over microchip's crazed need to alter the names of their registers and bitfields without changing their function. \r\n* The asset names for the Microchip board definitions was broken (exported hex/lst/map files)\r\n* Apparently, a small number of libraries expect to be able to pick up our hardware serial class from HardwareSerial.h and expect the class to be named HardwareSerial - that's never been what it was called on modern AVR cores, however rather than being addressed at the core level, this was being handled on an adhoc basis by individual libraries - we now provide a \"band-aid\" header to fix this issue in the form of HardwareSerial.h - which #defines HardwareSerial  to USARTClass and includes USART.h. \r\n* Updates to tinyNeoPixel to improve technical correctness of assembly. During this investigation, I realized that while the timing cannot be made perfect, it can still be made good enogh down as low as 4 MHz. No, I'm not sure what someone would be doing running at 4 MHz with a string of neopixels connected  - clearly they don't care about power consumption, because neopixels are power hogs even when off, and it is implausible that 8-10 MHz wouldn't be within spec at any voltage that  would successfully drive neopixels - but the technical challenge was small and there was no penalty imposed on users running a other speeds.\r\n* The API for the USERSIG libraries on the tinyAVR and Dx-series parts had been incompatible. It is now possible to write portable code for that library without #fdef's wrapping calls to USERSIG.flush() etc. Functions specific to the erase granularity (or lack thereof) of te DX-series parts were mirrored here. This is explained in detail in the USERSIG library docuementation. "}

These changes aren't as comprehensive, and I did more work here than on Wire.h (where I did virtually nothing other than the documentation). Check out the Serial Reference for more details, but in short\r\n  * **Added support for loopback, rs485, open drain mode!!**\r\n  * Added support for using event input instead of the RX pin (Untested)\r\n  * Even added support for MSPI and synch (clocked) mode\r\n  * Reimplemented ISRs in assembly, saving up to 1k of flash, and improving execution time such that you could receive bursts of characters at the maximum baud rate and not miss characters. \r\n  * Adjusted serial buffer size 512b and 1k parts by adding an intermediate 32b serial buffer size.\r\n  * Hoped for size improvements didn't materialize, but the assembly was enough to keep it from getting too bloated, at least. \r\n\r\n### **Other new features:**\r\n* Expanded Event library. Greatly Improved functionality for portable code/libraries\r\n  * Add a set of compatibility defines to make life easier for people porting non-Event-library event-using code to 0/1-series.\r\n* Actually prevent disabling warnings - -Wall for all! You should not be compiling code with warnings disabled, the vast majority of the time, they're pointing to problems, and in the cases that aren't bugs, they're still a weak point that future bugs could come from (and that people will comment on when you post the code on forums to ask for help).

Running the tuning sketch first is strongly recommended. The 2-series parts, at 5v and room temperature *will often run at 32 MHz* from the internal oscillator (after cranking the calibration way the hell up)! Under similar conditions, 0/1-series parts can sometimes run stabily at 30 MHz from internal, and 24 or 25 MHz should be no problem at all. Obviously, the operating temperature range will be more limited when overclocked in this way (and the internal oscillator can never push the parts quite as far as an external clock can). Be sure to read the tuning documentation if you're interested in using this functionality. \r\n * New advanced digital I/O functions: openDrain(), openDrainFast() and pinConfigure (first introduced on DxCore) are now available. The first two just provide a wrapper around writing to the direction bit instead of the output bit, allowing it to be used as an \"open drain\" output, which is very useful for interacting with devices running at a lower voltage, while pinConfigure() provides a single function to set (or leave unchanged) every parameter of the specified pin.\r\n * Early version of Event.h - however, my initial work with it showed that there are still serious features needed to make this particularly useful. We're getting there though. \r\n * C++ 17 support and support for libraries that insist on providing only precompiled source code. \r\n\r\n There's also a HUGE number of minor and major bugfixes in here this release. Truly too many to list - the changelog is not complete, and even that runs to over 30 bullet-points. \r\n\r\n We also now have better CI testing to catch any future problems which result in failures to compile, and look forward to improving this testing further.", "discussion_url": "https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/discussions/503"}

You can now write a full 32k chip in under 5 seconds using just a serial adapter and a resistor (or preferably a schottky diode like a 1N4148). jtag2updi is now a legacy programming tool, we do not recommend using it unless the serial adapter method is for some reason unsuitable (in which case one wonders why jtag2updi would be more suitable, but that's another issue...)\r\nWe also introduce the 2-series versions of Optiboot, in case anyone wants to use your serial adapter like that, instead of as a UPDI programmer..... \r\nKeywords.txt now includes all the register names from the datasheet (thanks @MCUdude )\r\nOptiboot users also get the Flash library to write to flash from application (@MCUdude  again - this is the version of Flash.h from MegaCoreX and like the version on classic AVRs, totally different from the Flash.h in DxCore (it's unfortunate that we named them the same thing).You now get a memory map too when you do Export compiled binary. Hopefully in future version I'll be able to automatically format it better than it is now - the first column is too small, so the columns don't line up; but because the numbers are hex, importing it into excel is annoying (excel is surprisingly bad at hexadecimal numbers)\r\n\r\nOther than that, this is largely a bugfix release: \r\n* Wire clock generation now does something like what it claims. (#400)\r\n* Issue with PWM on PIN_PC0 and PIN_PC1 not working correctly when they are written in rapid succession. (#414) \r\n* analogReadEnh() and analogReadDiff() on the 2-series would incorrectly configure CTRLB, leaving it set to 0 (an accidental copy/paste error from the 1-series) which set the ADC prescaler to the minimum, guaranteeing that the ADC clock was out of spec after the first ADC reading. It worked surprisingly well in that state such that I had missed the issue until I saw it by chance while investigating ways to try to improve the accuracy, which just didn't seem to be very good (well no wonder!)\r\n* Fix a theoretical bug in optiboot on all parts when an application directly jumps to reset or runs off the end of flash (we now do a software reset if we detect that so adverse peripheral configurations can't hose the bootloader). \r\n* Lots of other little stuff. Boards.txt looks lovely now!"}

A few critical bugfixes had to get released ASAP. \r\n* Burn bootloader for Optiboot boards when using the pyupdi style programer (ie, serial adapter with resistor) would report success but not actually write the bootloader to flash. A combination of a defect in the core and a bug in the tooling. We are waiting for a fix on the tooling bugs but in the meantime it was found to be possible to prevent to bug from manifesting by correcting the recipe used to build the command.\r\n* 2.2.7 introduced a regression in constrain() that caused this macro to not compile. This issue has been corrected.\r\n*  The TCD \"no glitch\" feature added a few versions ago introduced a regression in the handling of the INVEN (INVert ENable) bit, whereby digitalWrite on a pin used by TCD0 for PWM would unset that bit, in order to properly turn off PWM output which might be outputting 100% HIGH while still connected to the timer, which we do in order to avoid having to briefly stop the timer so we can access the TCD0.FAULTCTRL register; we want to unset it if its set when we turn off PWM.... but not if the user has set it for some other reason! This bug is corrected now - it will only touch INVEN if it is disconnecting pin from timer at same time.\r\n* Found a nasty bug in the routines for TCA0 PWM - has been there for ages, but first glance over how the compiler implemented it, it could have a dramatic effect on the performance of analog and digital writes to pins - problem came down to a \"variable shift\" - if you ask for `1<<7` that will get optimized to a constant with that value at compiletime. But if you do `1<<x` and x is not known at compiletime... that is a LOOP! At least 4 cycles per iteration assuming it's a byte; more for larger datatypes. I definitely hadn't realized that when I wrote the code in question. By looking up the bitmask instead of bit position, substantial performance improvement was realized, as well as flash savings.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to control hosting costs which I think are being driven by the github actions CI testing, I've tried attaching the avr-gcc toolchain version used by megaTinyCore and DxCore to this. Let's see if they let me get away with this...."}

Plus, it turned out that an update to avrdude.conf made the difference between working and not working with a bunch of new programmers, so we want that in the hands of everyone ASAP too, \r\n\r\nSo let's release this, and soon a 2.3.0-dev will be in master with 2-series parts sketched in, but no guarantees that anything works. Anyway, this adds the timer takeover functions (tell the core you're taking full control of the timer and to pretend it doesn't exist), and openDrain() (digitalWrite-esque wrapper around using a pin as an open drain output). And a few minor changes/fixes \r\n\r\n2.2.7 changes:\r\n* Clean up Servo formatting and comments and synchronize with DxCore version of library.\r\n* We were waiting for `ENRDY` to be set before changing enable-protected registers of TCD0. That doesn't appear to be needed. We just can't re-enable it until `ENRDY` is set. It makes the glitch when turning PWM off or on... maybe 6 CLK_PER shorter? I think under default settings, the loop goes from one iteration to none....\r\n* Do not initialize the the compare values of TCA0. 1. They are guaranteed by hardware to start up at 0, and we don't CARE what they start up as, because before the core turns any of them on, it sets them to a value. 24 bytes saved! (STS x 6)\r\n* Add `takeOverTCA0()`, `takeOverTCD0()`. Calling these will set a flag that tells `analogWrite()` and `digitalWrite()` not to try to configure these timers, and instead to act like the pin has no PWM functionality. User assumes responsibility for the management of Waveform Output.\r\n* Update avrdude.conf to **fix support for Snap, PICKit and Curiosity** programmer options.\r\n* Fix macro definitions of `sq()` and `constrain()` which were still vulnerable to stupid stuff caused by macro leading to arguments being evaluated multiple times.\r\n* Add `openDrain(),` `openDrainFast()` - `LOW`, `FLOAT`, and `CHANGE` are supported. LOW set pin to output, `FLOAT` (#defined as 1 now) sets it input, and `CHANGE` toggles it. It *does* turn off PWM, and it *does* set the PORTx.OUT for that pin to 0 so carelessness can't lead you to switching a pin left set to HIGH's output on (on the reasoning that you may be switching a line connected to something that could be damaged if you drove it high). It does not, however, touch the `PINnCTRL` register (so pullup is left on if you'd already set it that way). However `openDrainFast()` - the fast-I/O version of that function - does NOT touch the PWM or PORTx.OUT register.\r\n* IDE should now highlight a few more keywords associated with megaTinyCore.\r\n* Minor formatting improvements in ChangeLog.md.\r\n* Update avr-gcc toolchain to azduino3.\r\n\r\n(note - this is the second try at this release, hence the underscore in version number - I didn't check the CI results until after I'd released, and it turned out to be broken on 0-series. I pulled that after a half hour, without it ever having been available on board manager, but github won't let me reuse version numbers - you can never truly delete them)"}

It also adds a bit more documentation for the wire library Also, the SPI library no longer requires the SS pin to be specified, since there is literally nothing special about it the way the SPI library sets it up SPI.h is master only (SPI.h got major work done on DxCore - I didn't bother bringing the Dx-specific stuff back here, but I did remove SS pin requirement."}

Connect Rx to the UPDI pin, Vcc, and Ground and the new programmer option... and there you have it. And you don't have to fight with the strange problems that seem to plague jtag2updi, either. \r\nAdditionally, now, when uploading a sketch via UPDI, all \"safe\" fuses that are configured by a tools submenu (that is, those that could not result in the board being difficult to recover - namely BODCFG (setting BOD level higher that voltage you are running the device at) or SYSCFG1 (which is where UPDI vs Reset is selected - also unfortunately where EESAVE is). The main benefits are that you don't have to burn bootloader to change between 20-MHz-derived and 16-MHz derived clock speeds (a very frequent point of confusion). Al\r\nSince fuses cannot be set through the bootloader, though you do still need to burn bootloader to change this if you are using Optiboot; options which require \"burn bootloader\" say so in the tools menu. Uploading through UPDI (with optiboot or non-optiboot option selected) always erased the bootloader (like classic AVRs) - but now the BOOTEND fuses also get set to match what is being uploaded, so at least the sketch will run.\r\nAdded digitalWriteFast() and digitalReadFast() - these take the same arguments as the normal version of these functions (though they do not do anything fancier than changing the output value; digitalWriteFast() doesn't switch the pullups on and off if the pin is input or turn off PWM), and the pin number must be a constant known at compile time (otherwise it is a compile error) - but it is lightning fast, optimizing down to a single instruction! Speaking of digitalWrite() related stuff digitalWrite() on an INPUT will also set the pin's OUT value, emulating the behavior of classic AVRs which a lot of code relied on \r\nThe Servo library now works correctly.\r\nPWM on the pins controlled by TCD0 now works again (20 and 24-pin 1-series parts only)\r\nCorrected PWM duty cycle calculations on TCD0 pins (they were slightly off, though barely noticable in most circumstances.\r\nNew special feature on the TCD0 pins only: analogWrite(pin,255) results in a steady high, and analogWrite(pin,0) a steady low - but without the brief glitch from stopping the timer for a few cycles. digitalWrite() on those pins will fully disconnect them from the timer (which does cause the glitch, of course). \r\nOn all PWM pins, reduced the potential for a momentary glitch when turning off PWM.\r\nA lot of functions will now give a compile error if passed arguments which are constants, and not valid - such as writing to a non-existent pin, trying to set `DACReference(VDD);`, and so on.

This brings a bunch of changes meant to address some questionable decisions made early in the development of this core, in order to put the core on more solid foundations moving forward. The changes are as follows: \r\n* Remove all the UART/SPI/I2C pin mapping menus from tools submenus. Instead, use the newly added .swap() and .pins() methods on these objects to set the pins to be used. \r\n* **The default pins used for Serial on 8-pin parts in previous versions are not the \"default\" pins per datasheet (arduino pins 0 and 1); instead, the \"alternate\" pins were used by default (arduino pins 2 and 3). Note that on the Rev. - and Rev. A breakouts for these parts from my Tindie store, the serial lines from the FTDI header go to the alternate pins, not the \"default\" ones.** (this will be corrected in Rev. B of the board). If you have sketches/hardware using this, you will either need to move connections, or add Serial.swap(1); before calling Serial.begin(). I realize this is inconvenient, but that previous behavior should never have been the case, and, having finally accepted the fact, it was better to cut over quickly than let more people get used to the previous behavior and then change it later. \r\n* Improve ADC speed dramatically (it runs in about a quarter of the time it used to!) - I do not expect this to cause any issues with accuracy. The megaavr parts support much higher maximum ADC clock compared to the classic AVRs. We now set the ADC clock near to the top of it's range. In order to prevent this from hurting accuracy when reading high impedance sources, the ADC0.SAMPCTRL is set to SAMPLEN=14 instead of 0. This means samples will be taken for 16 ADC clocks instead of 2. Since the ADC clock is 8 times faster now, this should result in the same sampling time. See the ADC section for more information, including how to get even faster ADC readings from low impedance signals.\r\n* digitalRead(), pinMode(), and digitalWrite() were changed back to operating on uint8's instead of the PinMode, PinStatus, etc enums like the official megaavr core does (and unlike how every other core does it). Using the enums, while it was defensible from a software architecture perspective, caused a lot of breakage of common Arduino ideoms that have been in widespread use for ages, for very little benefit. This also applies to things that used BitOrder. \r\n* digitalRead(), pinMode(), digitalWrite() and analogWrite() now take advantage of the unified memory architecture of the megaavr parts to improve performance and reduce flash usage by removing the PROGMEM attribute and accompanying pgm_read_byte() calls. This yields a significant improvement in performance of analogWrite() and digitalRead() in particular. \r\n* Remove the DAC reference voltage from tools submenu. Now, use the DACReference() function - it can take any of the INTERNAL reference arguments that would be passed to analogReferece().\r\n* digitalRead() no longer turns off PWM and DAC output on the pin that is read. There was no technical need for this, and digitalRead() should not change the pin output state!\r\n* digitalRead() now returns an int8_t instead of an int16_t - this saves a tiny amount of flash and slightly improves execution time.\r\n* digitalRead() now returns -1 if called on a pin that doesn't exist, instead of 0 (LOW). This should make debugging easier, without impacting behavior when valid pin is passed to digitalRead().\r\n* Added support for manipulating the millis timer from within libraries or the sketch: init_millis(), stop_millis(), set_millis(), and restart_millis(). These are not expected to be normally used in sketches; these will be used in the upcoming megaTinySleep library which will \"switch\" millis timekeeping to the RTC when in sleep, and restore the millis value to whatever other timer is normally used. \r\n* Also fixes a bug with the EXTERNAL reference option being defined for the '212 and '412 - the 8-pin parts do not have that reference option, even if they're 1-series and otherwise would.\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues that you find!\r\n\r\nThis is the version for board manager installation."}

Both were due to integer-math that had not been caught previously. These have been fixed.

The EEPROM library has been enhanced to allow writing to the \"user row\", an extra page of flash that these parts have. When the Servo library was modified to not depend on the TCA0 prescaling, the \"trim\" duration used to correct for the time taken to call digitalWrite() was not changed to be consistent with this (as an aside, it was also wrong to begin with). The Servo library also now does not use the prescale of 2 when run at 10MHz or less, which should make the output ever-so-slightly smoother with slower clock speeds. The Wire library can now take up to three arguments when used in slave mode; the first is, as always, the slave address, the second is a bool; if true, it will also react to general call messages, and the third is put into the TWI0.SADDRMSK register, which can either act as a second address, or mask off specified bits of the address allowing it to respond to any address that matches the unmasked bits (like how some AT24-series EEPROMs use some of the device address bits as the high bits of the memory address). These new arguments are optional. Finally, the programmer included on the Xplained Pro demo boards is now supported.\r\n\r\nThis is the version for manual installation."}

This version also corrects the calculation for UART baud rate from the manufacturer supplied error values - previously this was straight up wrong, and could result in baud rates being calculated incorrectly.

Previously, TCA0 was used for millis on all parts. This had the unfortunate consequence that one could not take over TCA0 for other tasks. Now, on the 412/212/1614/814/414/214, which don't use TCD0 for PWM, we use that for millis() by default. Additionally, the millis()/micros() menu now allows you to force millis() to use a specific timer - TCA0, TCB0 (this takes out tone and servo), TCD0 (takes out two PWM pins on 20 and 24-pin parts), or TCB1 (1614/1616/3216/1617/3217 only). Most users won't use this, but if you need to take over a timer, it's great. Future releases will support using the RTC for millis (micros will not be supported) clocked at 32..768kHz from external watch crystal or ULP, leaving millis() available and all of the \"useful\" timers available for whatever use you have in mind.\r\nPlease keep your eyes out for issues - and remember, we have new breakout boards available in my tindie store, including ones preloaded with optiboot so you don't need a UPDI programmer - proceeds support continued core development: https://www.tindie.com/stores/drazzy/\r\n\r\nThis is the version for manual installation."}
