# Archi Model Repository Plug-in

## What is this?
This is an extension to Archi that allows collaborative work on Archi through sharing and versioning of models in a Repository. It's a work in progress. It is based on the [Grafico format](https://github.com/archi-contribs/archi-grafico-plugin/wiki/GRAFICO-explained) but hides all the Git complexity.

## How to use it
You can download the latest binary release on the Archi Plug-ins page [here](https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins). Follow the instructions there on how to install it and get started.

## Roadmap
There is no formal roadmap for the moment, development is done through sprints that try to gradually improve the overall value of this plugin. Focus if currently on user experience and more features (like branches managemnet) will come after.

Here is a basic vision and principles guiding the work:
