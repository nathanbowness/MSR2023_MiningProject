The default verbosity has also changed so that by default only warnings and errors will be output to the screen. The full debug output remains for the cis.log file.\n- Significant optimizations have been made in gridded -> ungridded collocation which should now be considerably faster. Also, when collocating multiple gridded source datasets the interpolation indices are now cached internally leading to further time savings.\n- Any `valid_range` attributes in supported NetCDF or HDF files (including MODIS, CALIOP and CloudSat) files are now automatically respected by CIS. All data values outside of the valid range are masked. Data from NetCDF files with `valid_min` or `valid_max` attributes is also masked appropriately.\n- CloudSat `missing` and `missop` attributes are now read and combined to mask out values which don't conform to the inequality defined.\n- [JASCIS-342] The extrapolation modes are now consistent across both gridded->gridded and gridded->ungridded collocation modes. The default is no extrapolation (gridded->gridded would previously extrapolate). This can still be overridden by the user.\n- [JASCIS-128] If the output file already exists the user is now prompted to overwrite it. This prompt can be disabled by using the --force-overwrite argument, or setting the `CIS_FORCE_OVERWRITE` environment variable to 'TRUE'.\n\n# Incompatible changes\n- To accommodate the new verbose flags (-v) the info command now takes a single datagroup argument, and optional variable names, as reflected in the updated documentation.\n- CIS no longer prepends ungridded output files with 'cis-'. Instead CIS creates a global attribute in the output file called source which contains 'CIS<version>'. This is checked in the updated CIS plugin when reading any NetCDF file.\n  \n  Note - While this is much neater going forward and will hopefully save a lot of head scratching it will mean CIS is unable to read old files produced by CIS automatically. All commands can be forced to use the CIS product by including the product=cis keyword argument. Alternatively you can update the data file manually using the following command:\n    `ncatted -O -a source,global,a,c,\"CIS\" in.nc`\n\n# Bugs fixed\n- [JASCIS-34] MODIS L3 data is now correctly treated as gridded data.\n- [JASCIS-345] Product regular expression matching now matches the whole string rather than just the start.\n- [JASCIS-360] Collocation now correctly applies the 'missing_data_for_missing_sample' logic for all collocations.\n- [JASCIS-361] Fixed the CloudSat scale and offset transformation so that they are now applied correctly.\n- [JASCIS-281] Fixed a caching error when aggregating multiple ungridded datasets which could lead to incorrect values\n- CIS no longer crashes when the CIS_PLUGIN_HOME path cannot be found\n"}

Pandas is an extensive python library providing many powerful data analysis algorithms and routines.\n- Compatibility updates for newer versions of Numpy and SciPy. The minimum require version of SciPy is now 0.16.0\n- Swapped out Basemap plotting routines for Cartopy. This removed a dependancy (as Cartopy was already required by\n  Iris), and has given us more flexibility for plotting different projections in the future\n- Plots now automatically try to use the most appropriate resolution background images for plots over coastlines NASA\n  blue marble images.\n- 'scatter_overlay' plots have been completely removed (they have been deprecated for the last two versions), the same\n  functionality can be achieved through the more generic 'overlay' plots.\n- Update to the UngriddedData.coord() and .coords() API to match the changes in IRIS >=1.8. This allows users to also\n  search for coordinates by supplying a `Coord` instance to compare against. Currently this only compares\n  standard names, but this may be extended in the future.\n\n# Bugs fixed\n- JASCIS-279 - This release removes the basemap dependency and means we can use a much newer version of GEOS which\n  doesn't clash with the SciTools version\n- JASCIS-267 - Fixed ASCII file reading to be compatible with Numpy 1.9\n- JASCIS-259 - Fixed Stats unit tests to reflect updates in SciPy (>0.15.0) linear regression routines for masked arrays\n- JASCIS-211 - Subsetting now accepts variable names (rather than axes shorthands) more consistently, the docs have\n  been updated to make the dangers of relying on axes shorthands clear and an error is now thrown if a specific subset\n  coordinate is not found.\n- JASCIS-275 - The ungridded subsetting is now done array-wise rather than element wise giving large performance\n  improvements\n"}

This makes the installation of CIS on e.g. Windows much easier when HDF reading is not required.\n\n# Bugs fixed\n- JASCIS-243 - Error when reading multiple GASSP aircraft files\n- JASCIS-139 - Updated ungridded aggregation to rename any variables which clash with coordinate variables, as this breaks during the output otherwise.\n- Compatibility fixes for Numpy versions >1.8 and Python-NetCDF versions >1.1.\n- Fix Caliop pressure units which were stored as hPA, but need to be hPa to conform to CF.\n- The integration test data has been moved completely out of the repository - making the download quicker and less bloated. It's location can be specified by setting the CIS_DATA_HOME environment variable.\n- A test runner has been created to allow easy runnning of the unit and integration test.\n"}
