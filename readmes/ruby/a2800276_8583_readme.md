# ISO 8583 Financial Messaging for Ruby

This package currently contains code for coding an decoding ISO 8583
Financial Message.

## Developing

In case you're using a ruby version >= 2.2, test-unit is no longer in
the std lib, so it needs to be available. Bundler installs this, if not
using bundler, you need to run `gem install test-unit` before running
the tests.

## Installing

You can install the last version of the +iso8583+ package by executing:

	gem install iso8583 

## Source

The source is most readily available on github[http://github.com/a2800276/8583].
