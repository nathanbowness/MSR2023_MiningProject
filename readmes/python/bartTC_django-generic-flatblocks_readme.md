=========================
django-generic-flatblocks
=========================

If you want to add tiny snippets of text to your site, manageable by the admin
backend, you would use either `django-chunks`_ or `django-flatblocks`_.
However, both of them have one problem: you are limited to a predefined
content field; a "text" field in chunks and a "title" and "text" field in
flatblocks.

django-generic-flatblocks solves this problem as it knows nothing about the
content itself. You *attach* your hand made content node (a simple model) where
you can define any fields you want.
