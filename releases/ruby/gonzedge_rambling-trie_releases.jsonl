Supported formats include Ruby's `Marshal` (`.marshal`) with\n    `Serializers::Marshal` and `YAML` (`.yaml` or `.yml`) with\n    `Serializers::Yaml`\n  - The format to use is determined by the filepath extension and\n    `Marshal` is used when a format isn't recognized.\n    \n    ``` ruby\n    # Save `your_trie` into a file\n    Rambling::Trie.dump your_trie, 'a filename'\n    \n    # Load a trie from a file into memory\n    trie = Rambling::Trie.load 'a filename'\n    ```\n- Add `Serializers::Zip` to handle zip files by\n  [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  \n    Automatically detects `.marshal` and `.yaml` files, as well as any\n    configured `Serializer` based on filepath extension\n- Add ability to configure `rambling-trie` [#11](https://github.com/gonzedge/rambling-trie/issues/11)\n  by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  \n  ``` ruby\n    Rambling::Trie.config do |config|\n      config.compressor = MyCompressor.new\n      config.root_builder = lambda { MyNode.new }\n  \n      config.readers.add :html, MyHtmlReader.new\n      config.readers.default = config.readers[:html]\n  \n      config.serializers.add :json, MyJsonSerializer.new\n      config.serializers.default = config.serializers[:yml]\n    end\n  ```\n- Add `#words_within` and `#words_within?` to get all words matched within a\n  given string [#9](https://github.com/gonzedge/rambling-trie/issues/9) by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  - `#words_within` returns all the matched words\n  - `#words_within?` returns `true` as soon as it finds one matching word\n- Add `#==` to compare nodes by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  \n  Contained in `Rambling::Trie::Comparable` module. Two nodes are equal to\n  each other if they have the same letter, they are both either terminal or\n  non-terminal and their children tree is the same\n- Add changelog by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Add contributing guide by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n\n#### Minor\n- Extract modules for peripheral node functionality by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  - Move `#to_s` to `Stringifyable` module\n  - Move `#as_word` to `Stringifyable` module by\n  - Move `#==` to `Comparable` module\n  - Rename `Compression` to `Compressable`\n  - Rename `Inspector` to `Inspectable`\n- Add `#terminal?` value to inspect output by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Display value of `#terminal` instead of `#terminal?` when `Node` is inspected\n  by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Freeze `Rambling::Trie::VERSION` by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Refactor performance instrumentation tasks by\n  [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n  - Add `Performance` module\n  - Add `Performance::Reporter` & `Performance::Directory` classes\n  - Move task execution into individual classes\n  - Unify all tasks into single entry point `rake performance[type,method]`\n- Change benchmark report format by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Correct supported versions by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Only create new `Reader` instance when filepath is given on initialization by\n  [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n- Update license year by [@gonzedge](https://github.com/gonzedge)\n"}
